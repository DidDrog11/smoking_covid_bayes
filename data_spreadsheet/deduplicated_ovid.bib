AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged >=65 years., DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged >=65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the >=65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease., CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the influenza season 2020/2021 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures., DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China., METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan)., RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study investigated the correlation between the nutritional status and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different nutritional status., METHODS: 429 patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from December 2019 to March 2020 were selected and divided into different groups based on Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score (0-4: the low CONUT score group; 5-12: the high CONUT score group). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the effects of CONUT score on prognosis., RESULTS: The total score of admission status of patients with higher CONUT score was higher than that of those with lower CONUT score (chi2 = 7.152, P = 0.007). The number of adverse outcomes of female was higher than that of male (chi2 = 10.253, P = 0.001). The number of adverse outcomes was higher for patients with smoking history (P = 0.004) or hypertension (chi2 = 11.240, P = 0.001) than those without. Also, the number of adverse outcomes was higher for older patients than younger ones (chi2 = 15.681, P < 0.001). Patients with adverse outcomes had lower urine red blood cell count than patients without adverse outcomes (chi2 = 5.029, P = 0.025). However, BMI, drinking history and diabetes did not show correlation with the prognosis of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). Among patients >= 61 years old, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 6.191 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 6.191, 95% CI: 1.431-26.785). Among the non-diabetic patients, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT group was 11.678 times that of the low CONUT group (OR = 11.678, 95% CI: 2.754-49.41). For the patients who had a total score of admission status < 6, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 8.216 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 8.216, 95% CI: 2.439-27.682)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with good nutritional status showed a small chance to have adverse outcomes. Gender, age, hypertension, the number of urine red blood cell count and CONUT score affected the adverse outcomes of patients.

AB  - The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in late 2019 and early 2020. The factors that influence disease severity should be of clinical concern. Existing findings on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are also controversial and need to be confirmed by further research. In addition, the effects of alcohol consumption and betel quid (BQ) chewing on COVID-19 are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the effects of smoking, drinking, BQ chewing, and underlying diseases on the severity of COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted on 91 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Yueyang, Hunan Province, China from 21 January to 8 March, 2020. Patient demographic data, and information on smoking, drinking and BQ chewing, and underlying diseases were extracted from the patient electronic medical records (EMR) and telephone interviews. The chi-square test was used to conduct a univariate analysis of the factors influencing the severity of COVID-19, and ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to the severity of COVID-19. The results showed that the rates of smoking, drinking and BQ chewing were 15.4, 26.4, and 7.1%, respectively, there was no significant relationship between these lifestyle factors and the severity of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). However, underlying diseases such as diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 7.740, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.000-60.740, P = 0.050], source of infection (OR = 0.180, 95% CI: 0.030-0.980, P = 0.049), and employment status (retired/unemployed vs. employed: OR = 29.430, 95% CI, 1.050 - 822.330, P = 0.047) were significant independent predictors of severe COVID-19 infection. These individuals should be informed of methods to increase personal protection, and doctors should prevent these individuals from developing serious diseases. It is important to pay attention to the source of infection and timely medical treatment. This study showed that the clinical classification of COVID-19 was associated with patients with diabetes, source of infection, and retired/unemployed. Therefore in the clinical practice of COVID-19 should be more concern these factors. Although no statistical significance was found in smoking, drinking alcohol, BQ chewing, and severity of COVID-19 patients, more studies have confirmed that are harmful and risk factors for underlying diseases in the population. Health authorities should formulate policies to publicize the harmful effects of smoking, drinking, and betel nut chewing and promote a healthy lifestyle.

AB  - During the COVID-19 epidemic, our national guidelines have suggested that surgical patients should wear a mask to decrease the potential transmission of COVID-19 in the operating room, as long as the condition allows. However, so far, there is no study to discuss the influence of wearing a mask on the ventilation and blood oxygenation status in patients of spontaneous breathing with supplementary oxygen through an anesthetic facemask. This is a before-after study in the same patient, and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited, by testing the arterial blood gas parameters at key time points before and after oxygen inhalation to evaluate the effects of two different supplementary oxygen methods ('disposable medical mask + anesthetic facemask' and 'anesthetic facemask only') on the oxygenation of subjects. Our data demonstrated whether wearing a disposable medical mask or not could effectively increase the oxygen supply of the subjects compared with the basic value before oxygen inhalation; however, compared with the group without mask, the arterial oxygen partial (PaO 2) reduced significantly at each time points when subjects wearing a disposable medical mask. There was no significant difference in other parameters, and our data showed that age growth and smoking had no significant effects on the difference of PaO 2 between the groups with and without masks. This study demonstrates effective oxygen supplementation through anesthetic facemask in subjects with spontaneous breathing who is wearing a disposable medical mask, whose pulse oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen saturation can reach 100% rapidly, and this provides a theoretical basis for the management of patients with disseminated respiratory diseases to wear masks in the operating room; however, the rate and amount of PaO 2 increase are both decreased as compared to those who is not wearing a disposable medical mask during supplementary oxygenation. Whether this difference will affect the clinical outcome needs further study.

AB  - This study was to explore the performance of immune function and compositions of hospitalization cost for patients with COVID-19 as well as the application of a grey relational mathematical model (GRMM). A total of 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and chest CT examination in our hospital were collected in this study. They were divided into 2 groups: non-severe group (mild and moderate patients, n = 57 cases), and severe group (severe and critical patients, n = 43 cases) based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general clinical data, blood routine indexes, cellular immune and humoral immune function test indexes, and the composition of hospitalization costs of the two groups of patients were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the average age, proportion of males, smoking history, and the number and proportion of patients in the non-severe group were smaller than those in the severe group (P < 0.05); the severe group had significantly more shortness of breath patients than the non-severe group (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the number of white blood cells (WBC), the number and proportion of neutrophils, and the count of neutrophils/lymphocytes in the severe group increased obviously (P < 0.05), and the number of lymphocytes and the proportion of monocytes decreased dramatically (P < 0.05); the number and proportion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ in the severe group were much lower in contrast to those in the non-severe group (P < 0.05), while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was greatly higher in contrast to that of non-severe patients (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the bed fee, laboratory test fee, diagnosis fee, and medicine fee of the severe group were increased observably (P < 0.05). The changes in hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and expenses of proprietary Chinese medicines, while the hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and examination fees. The results revealed that elderly COVID-19 patients with basic diseases were prone to develop severe disease, immune cell depletion may be one of the reasons for the development of severe patients, and the medical insurance policy greatly reduced the hospitalization costs of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current pandemic, and studies reported that older people have higher rates of infection and more severe cases. Recently, studies have revealed the involvement of both genetic and exposure factors in the susceptibility of COVID-19. However, the correlation between them is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the correlation between genetic and exposure factors associated with COVID-19. We retrieved the information of 7362 participants with COVID-19 testing results from the UK Biobank. We identified genetic factors for COVID-19 by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary analysis. In this study, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 15 exposure factors [smoking, alcohol intake, daytime dozing, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, dementia, atmosphere NO2 concentration, socioeconomic status, education qualification, ethnicity, and income] were found to be potential risk factors of COVID-19. Then, a gene-exposure (GxE) association network was built based on the correlation among and between these genetic factors and exposure factors. rs140092351, a SNP on microRNA miR1202, not only had the most significant association with COVID-19, but also interacted with multiple exposure factors. Dementia, alcohol consumption, daytime dozing, BMI, HDL, and atmosphere NO2 concentration were among most significant GxE interactions with COVID-19 infection (P=0.001). Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since December 2019, the pneumonia cases infected with 2019 novel coronavirus have appeared, posing a critical threat to global health. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to discover the different clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 to find the potential risk factors and predictors of this disease's severity, as well as to serve as a guidance for subsequent epidemic prevention and control work. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and other databases were searched to collect studies on the difference of clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and the funnel plots could be made to evaluate the publication bias. P>0.05 means no statistical significance. Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse. In terms of laboratory indicators, the decreased lymphocyte and platelet count, and the increased levels of white blood cell (WBC), D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were more prevalent in severe patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age, gender, and proportion of severe cases did not significantly impact on the outcomes of any clinical indexes that showed high degree of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, the severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by, radiologic finding, some symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, some laboratory indicators, and smoking history, especially the ex-smokers. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have complications and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc., which were the risk factors for the disease to be severer, but the chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease were not associated the severity of COVID-19 in China.

AB  - Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan and spread in China. Here we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases. We collected and analyzed the clinical data of 172 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 who were diagnosed via qRT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs during January 2020 and February 2020. The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists. The older patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis. The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID-19. Family gatherings were showed among 26.7% of patients. A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases. CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes. The lungs of severe patients are more damaged. Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis. Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 93.0%, and the mortality rate was 2.3%. Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes. The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has created universal disarray since its outbreak in 2019. Emergent measures were taken worldwide to mitigate the morbid outcomes of the pandemic. Multiple organ systems have been shown to be negatively impacted secondary to the heightened inflammatory response to the novel virus. In this report, we focus on the respiratory system. The novel virus impact on the respiratory system has been well documented, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we present a case of a patient with no risk factors for pneumothorax (smoking, underlying lung disease, prior history of pneumothorax, age, family history) who was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and developed a significant pneumothorax requiring transfer to the intensive care unit.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from smokers, non-smokers, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer. An exhaustive search of the GEO database was performed to identify eligible data on 1st June 2020. In total, 46 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3,053 samples were identified as eligible data for further analysis. All meta-analysis were performed using RStudio. Standardized mean difference was utilized to assess the effect size of a factor on the expression of targeted genes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. This study revealed that (i) cigarette smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; (ii) significant alternations in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L were observed between current smokers and former smokers, but not between former smokers and never smokers; (iii) when compared with healthy controls with identical smoking status, patients with COPD or lung cancer showed negligible changes in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. Therefore, this study implicates cigarette smoking might contribute to the development of COVID-19 by affecting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, while smoking cessation could be effective to reduce the potential risk.

The aim of this study is to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 among the bankers who are usually more exposed to random people that put them at great risk to be affected. A total of 248 bankers willingly answered our questionnaire consisting of DASS-21 and relevant questions. Cronbach's reliability coefficient for the DASS-21 scale ranges from 0.84 to 0.90 which advocates that DASS-21 scales are highly reliable measures for this study. Results show that among participants, 11.1% were severe to extremely stressed, 10.6% of bankers were severe to extremely anxious, and 12.1% of them were severe to extremely depressed. The study illustrated, among the Bankers whose colleagues were infected (B=2.251, 95% CI: - 1.473, 3.029), who smoking more (B= 1.505, 95% CI: 0.411, 2.599), who wake up from sleep having a bad dreams (B = 1.018, 95% CI: 0.057, 1.979), their fear of getting infected (B = 1.717, 95% CI: 0.392, 3.04), who use public transportation (B = 1.378, 95% CI: 0.430, 2.236), who misbehave with family members (B = 1.033, 95% CI: 0.071, 1.995) and who beaten children (B = 1.210, 95% CI: 0.141, 2.279) were responsible for higher stress, depression and anxiety scores respectively. Whereas, taking nutritious food (B = -0.229, 95% CI: -0.30, 1.763), doing physical exercises (B = -0.325, 95% CI: -1.158, 0.508) reduced depression, stress and anxiety scores. The authors believed that the result of the study will be beneficial for the government and its policymakers to take psychological intervention strategies and to make certain sufficient corporal settlement of the banking professionals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clusters of novel coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have spread to become a global pandemic imposing a significant burden on healthcare systems. The lack of an effective treatment and the emergence of varied and complicated clinical courses in certain populations have rendered treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 difficult., METHODS: Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, a public tertiary acute care center located in Tokyo, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Japan, has been admitting patients with COVID-19 since February 2020. The present, retrospective, case-series study aimed to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the study institution., RESULTS: In total, 101 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital to receive inpatient care. Eleven patients (10.9%) received ECMO, and nine patients (8.9%) died during hospitalization after COVID-19 was diagnosed. A history of smoking and obesity were most commonly encountered among patients with a complicated clinical course. Most patients who died requested to be transferred to advanced palliative care in the early course of their hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of caring for these patients demonstrated a relatively lower mortality rate and higher survival rate in those with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement than previous reports from other countries and underscored the importance of proactive, advanced care planning in the early course of hospitalization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has made people uncertain about their perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 and COVID-19 response measures. To mount an effective response to this epidemic, it is necessary to understand the public's perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypothesis that people's perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 influence their attitudes and behaviors., METHODS: This study used an open dataset of web-based questionnaires about COVID-19. The questionnaires were provided by Nexoid United Kingdom. We selected the results of a questionnaire on COVID-19-related behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions among the US public. The questionnaire was conducted from March 29 to April 20, 2020. A total of 24,547 people who lived in the United States took part in the survey., RESULTS: In this study, the average self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 was 33.2%, and 49.9% (12,244/24,547) of the respondents thought that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were less than 30%. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 among women was 1.35 times that of males. A 5% increase in perceived infection risk was significantly associated with being 1.02 times (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02; P<.001) more likely to report having close contact with >10 people, and being 1.01 times (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01; P<.001) more likely to report that cohabitants disagreed with taking steps to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there was no significant association between participants who lived with more than 5 cohabitants or less than 5 cohabitants (P=.85). Generally, participants who lived in states with 1001-10,000 COVID-19 cases, were aged 20-40 years, were obese, smoked, drank alcohol, never used drugs, and had no underlying medical conditions were more likely to be in close contact with >10 people. Most participants (21,017/24,547, 85.6%) agreed with washing their hands and maintaining social distancing, but only 20.2% (4958/24,547) of participants often wore masks. Additionally, male participants and participants aged <20 years typically disagreed with washing their hands, maintaining social distancing, and wearing masks., CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first attempt to describe the determinants of the US public's perception of the threat of COVID-19 on a large scale. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 differed significantly based on the respondents' genders, states of residence, ages, body mass indices, smoking habits, alcohol consumption habits, drug use habits, underlying medical conditions, environments, and behaviors. These findings can be used as references by public health policy makers and health care workers who want to identify populations that need to be educated on COVID-19 prevention and health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic of global public health concern. We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases., RESULTS: Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease. Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer. Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases., CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung. Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New evidence from retrospective cohort studies on risk of death from COVID-19 infection became available. We aimed to systematically review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcome of COVID-19., METHODS: We performed meta-analysis, using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from December 1 2019 to June 10 2020. The meta-analysis summarized clinical, laboratory, radiological features, and complications of non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19. In addition, a fixed- or random-effects model was adopted based on the heterogeneity among studies. We also used funnel-plot with Egger's tests to screen potential publication bias., RESULTS: In total, twenty studies with 15,408 COVID-19 cases were included in our meta-analysis. Male, current smoking, and older age were associated with in-hospital death. Patients aged 60 years or over had the highest pooled ORs [OR 4.94 (2.89, 8.44)]. Non-survivors were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Respiratory disease had the highest pooled ORs [OR 2.55 (2.14, 3.05)]. Dyspnea [OR 3.31 (1.78, 6.16); I2 : 83%] and fatigue [OR 1.36 (1.07, 1.73); I2 : 0%] were associated with increased risk of death. Increased white blood cell count, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, were also associated with increased risk of death. Biomarkers of coagulation function, inflammation, liver and kidney function, cardiac and muscle injury were also elevated in nonsurvivors., CONCLUSIONS: Male, current smoking patients aged 60 years or over might face a greater risk of in-hospital death and the comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory disease, and CKD could also influence the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical feature such as dyspnea and fatigue could imply the exacerbation and even death. Our findings highlighted early markers of mortality which were beneficial to identify fatal COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted specialty chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care. We examined the degree to which care has moved to remote approaches, eliciting clinician and patient perspectives on what is appropriate for ongoing remote delivery., METHODS: Using an online research platform, we conducted a survey and consensus-building process involving clinicians and patients with COPD., RESULTS: Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52, 95%), reinforce smoking cessation (n=46, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%), providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%), reinforcing smoking cessation (81%), deciding whether patients should seek in-person care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%)., CONCLUSION: Adoption of remote care delivery appears high, with many care activities partially or completely delivered remotely. Our work identifies strengths and limitations of remote care delivery. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - AIMS: To report long-term outcomes of patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for early stage, peripherally located non-small cell lung cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value. Survival was poorer for patients who received the 50 Gy in 10 fractions schedule. Treatment was very well tolerated with very low rates of grade 3-4 toxicity (1%)., CONCLUSIONS: SABR for peripherally located, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer can be safely and effectively implemented in a non-academic institution with appropriate equipment and training. Overall survival outcomes and toxicity rates are comparable with internationally published studies. Patients treated with 50 Gy in 10 fractions had a poorer survival outcome.

AB  - An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4%-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase ACE2 mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant pressure on health and social care. Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19., METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease., RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58-81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6-24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty (>= CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1-3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97-4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94-7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09-7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12-4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06-9.56)., CONCLUSIONS: Around a quarter of patients admitted with COVID-19 had increased care needs at discharge. Pre-admission frailty was strongly associated with the need for an increased level of care at discharge. Our results have implications for service planning and public health policy as well as a person's functional outcome, suggesting that frailty screening should be utilised for predictive modelling and early individualised discharge planning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Population-based data on the current Covid-19 pandemic is scarce. This study investigated incidence and risk to suffer Covid-19 by baseline underlying conditions in people >=50 years in Tarragona region across march-april 2020., METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study involving 79,071 adults >=50 years-old in Tarragona region (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Cohort characteristics (age, sex, residence, vaccinations history and comorbidities) were established at baseline, and Covid-19 cases occurring between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 were registered. Cox regression analysis calculating Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to estimate risk for Covid-19., RESULTS: Across study period, 1,547 cohort members were PCR tested (22.6% positive) and 367 were presumptive cases without PCR tested. Considering PCR-confirmed Covid-19, incidence (per 100,000 persons-period) was 441 overall (248, 141, 424, 1,303 and 3,135 in 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and >=90 years-old, respectively; 380 in men and 497 in women; 259 in community-dwelling and 10,571 in nursing-home). By comorbidities, maximum incidence emerged among persons with neurological disease (2,723), atrial fibrillation (1,348), chronic renal failure (1,050), cardiac disease (856), respiratory disease (798) and diabetes (706). Lower incidence appeared in rheumatic diseases (230) and smokers (180). In multivariable analysis focused on community-dwelling individuals (N=77,671), only cardiac disease (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p=0.045) and respiratory disease (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00-3.02; p=0.051) were associated with an increased risk, whereas smoking (HR:0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74; p=0.002) and influenza vaccinated (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; p=0.015) appeared associated with a decreased risk., CONCLUSIONS: Apart of increasing age and nursing-home residence, chronic respiratory and cardiac disease appear at increased risk for suffering covid19. This study investigated population-based incidence of Covid-19 infection by underlying conditions among adults >=50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) across two first months pandemic period.

AB  - Respiratory infections in infancy may protect against developing Th2-mediated allergic disease (hygiene hypothesis). To estimate the relative contribution of particular viruses to the development of the immune system and allergic disease, we investigated longitudinally the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants. One hundred and twenty-six healthy infants were included in this prospective birth cohort study in their first year of life. Physical examination was performed and nasal brush samples were taken during routine visits every 6 months and during an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (sick visits). The prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants with URTI, infants with rhinitis without general malaise and infants without nasal symptoms was studied. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent pathogen during URTI and rhinitis in 0- to 2-year-old infants ( approximately 40%). During URTI, also respiratory syncytial virus ( approximately 20%) and coronavirus ( approximately 10%) infections were found, which were rarely detected in infants with rhinitis. Surprisingly, in 20% of infants who did not present with nasal symptoms, rhinovirus infections were also detected. During routine visits at 12 months, a higher prevalence of rhinovirus infections was found in infants who attended day-care compared with those who did not. We did not observe a relation between breast-feeding or smoking by one or both parents and the prevalence of rhinovirus infections. The parental history of atopy was not related to the prevalence of rhinovirus infection, indicating that the genetic risk of allergic disease does not seem to increase the chance of rhinovirus infections. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection is the most prevalent respiratory viral infection in infants. It may therefore affect the maturation of the immune system and the development of allergic disease considerably.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sex is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the epidemiology and outcome of many diseases. This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females., CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.

AB  - Acute bronchiolitis, mostly seen in infants and younger children, is a lower respiratory tract infection frequently caused by viral agents. We aimed to determine the frequency of a broad panel of respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV) and to assess the clinical characteristics of acute bronchiolitis in a group of children under 24 months of age. A total of 62 children (45 male, 17 female; age range: 0-2 years) with the initial diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and 33 healthy children (21 male, 12 female; age range: 0-2 years) as control group who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of Mersin University Hospital, southern Turkey, from January to July 2010 were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the study groups and the detection of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A & B; rhinovirus (RV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A & B; influenza virus type A [H1N1, H3N2, H1N1v], B & C; parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1, 2, 3 & 4A/B; adenovirus (AdV); HBoV; coronavirus (CoV 229E); enterovirus (EV)], were performed by using a commercial system namely CLART RPneumovir (Clinical Array Technology, Genomica, Spain) based on the principle of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) and DNA microarray. Demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients, treatment protocols and the relationship between the length of hospitalization and the viral agents determined were also evaluated. Of the 62 samples collected from bronchiolitis cases, at least one virus was detected in 52 (83.9%) and viral co-infections were detected in 31 (50%) of them. Including the co-infections, RSV was the most commonly identified virus (n= 21; 33.9%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 18; 29%), RV (n= 18; 29%), hMPV (n= 13; 21%), PIV (n= 10; 16.1%), AdV (n= 5; 8%), HBoV (n= 3; 4.8%) and EV (n= 1; 1.6%). Of the 33 samples from healthy children, at least one virus was detected in 21 (63.6%) and viral co-infections were detected in seven (21.2%) samples. Including the co-infections, the most commonly detected virus was RV (n= 10; 30.3%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 6; 18.1%), AdV (n= 6; 18.1%), RSV (n= 4; 12.1%) and PIV (n= 3; 9%), however HBoV and hMPV were not detected in the control group. The differences of demographic features (age, gender, history of atopy, exposure of smoking, length of breast-feeding, presence of school-age sibling) and frequency of virus detection (83.9% and 63.6%, respectively) between the patient and control groups were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). The most common complaints of patients on admission were cough (100%), runny nose (82.3%) and respiratory difficulty (71%), whereas fever was present in 21 (33.9%) patients. The most common findings on physical examination were prolonged expirium (98.4%), rhonchi (98.4%), rales (80.6%), tachypnea (71%) and tachycardia (67.7%). Pulmonary graphies revealed that diffuse air trappings were more common in virus-associated bronchiolitis (36/52; 69.2%) cases, on the other hand infiltrations were more common (6/10; 60%) in patients who were virus-negative (p< 0.05). The demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings, clinical severity scores, hospitalization rates and duration of hospitalizations in bronchiolitis cases did not show statistically significant differences between the viral agents (p> 0.05 for each parameter). However the rates of antibiotic and steroid use in hospitalized patients (24/34 and 5/34, respectively) were significantly higher than those of outpatients (7/28 and 0/28, respectively) (p= 0.001 and p= 0.03). Our data indicated a high rate (~84%) of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the Mersin province and the detection of hMPV (21%) and HBoV (4.8%) only in the patient group encouraged their roles in the etiology of acute brochiolitis. It was concluded that viral etiology should be investigated in selected cases to prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment and to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy when necessary.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has major effects on the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes among patients, producing severe symptoms and death. Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases severity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from the initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies about smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test., RESULTS: A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of 40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking and former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16-2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64-3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. Similarly, current smoking and former smoking also significantly increase the risk of death (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12-1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.15-3.09, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias, which was tested by the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, even current smoking or former smoking, significantly increases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death. Further causational studies on this association and ascertianing the underlying mechanisms of this relation is warranted. Copyright 2021 Umnuaypornlert A. et al.

AB  - Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which emerged from China and spread all over the world, has affected the world in every aspect and will do so in the foreseeable future. This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement., Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization., Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 +/- 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant., Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - This study focuses on how socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence self-protective behaviours during a pandemic, with protection behaviours being assessed through three perspectives - social distancing, personal protection behaviour and social responsibility awareness. The research considers a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and utilises a data analysis framework combining Classification and Regression Tree (CART), a data mining approach, and regression analysis to gain deep insights. The analysis reveals Socio-demographic attributes - sex, marital family status and having children - as having played an influential role in Japanese citizens' abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours. Especially women with children are noted as more conscious than their male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact concerning social distancing. Trust in government also appears as a significant factor. The analysis further identifies smoking behaviour as a factor characterising subjective prevention actions with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers being more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during pandemics and national emergencies.

PY  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amoung patients suffering from psychotic disorders. The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions., METHODS: We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared., RESULTS: As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.

AB  - Olfactory and/or taste dysfunction are potential neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the study was to document the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19 positive patients and analyze the effect of various factors on the occurrence of these chemosensory dysfunction in the local population. Tertiary referral center. Prospective Study. 250 subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and admitted in Isolation ward were enrolled for the study. Data was collected from the subjects via oral questionnaire method, based on the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool. Data was collected regarding the age, gender, olfactory or gustatory disturbances, history of recent travel or contact with a positive case, smoking, any associated symptoms, any co-morbid conditions and recovery time of sense of olfaction. Out of 250, 179 (71.6%) subjects were diagnosed with Olfactory dysfunction out of which majority were males, 105 (58.6%). Most of the patients were above 40 years of age (n = 184, 73.6%). Majority of the individuals (88 patients) had close contact with a positive case in recent past, followed by 67 patients who were health care workers, hence proving that risk of infection increases with exposure. Anosmia was present in 68.5% of all the 127 non-smokers. 66.4% had both olfactory as well as gustatory dysfunction whereas 18 patients (7.2%) were found to be totally asymptomatic. Mostly patients recovered their sense of smell within 1-2 weeks from the day of onset of anosmia. Presence of olfactory dysfunction of any degree with or without alteration in taste sensation should raise a suspicion of COVID-19 infection, especially when other classical signs are not present. In such conditions, swabs should be sent for confirmation by RT-PCR testing and till results are awaited, the individual should be shifted to quarantine facilities or advised strict self-isolation.

AB  - Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, and therefore the prevention and treatment of this disease is an important priority of world health. In the present study, some risk factors, including unhealthy nutrition, obesity, and physical inactivity, were assessed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on the severity and duration of disease were evaluated., Subject and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected from all patients who visited the respiratory emergency department from March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020 in the University Hospital. The outcome measures were body mass index, diet quality that was evaluated with a 16-item food intake questionnaire, and physical activity level that was assessed by the global physical activity questionnaire., Results: Two hundred and six patients' data was analyzed. The results investigated that patients with lower levels of physical activity or lower MET.min/week were affected by a more severe form of the disease (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). We found that patients with a healthier dietary pattern were affected by lower severity of illness (p < 0.05)., Conclusion: It seems that increasing levels of physical activity may partly reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. Some dietary patterns such as increasing fruit and poultry consumption as well as drinking less tea were correlated significantly with a less severe form of the disease. The results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potentially harmful effect of smoking on the severity or duration of symptoms.

AB  - Background: The number of asymptomatic infected patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is rampaging around the world but limited information aimed on risk factors of asymptomatic infections. The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors of symptoms onset and clinical features in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 70 asymptomatic COVID-2019 infected patients confirmed by nucleic acid tests in Hunan province, China between 28 January 2020 and 18 February, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical features and laboratory data were reviewed and analyzed. Presence or absence at the onset of symptoms was taken as the outcome. A Cox regression model was performed to evaluate the potential predictors of the onset of symptoms. Results: The study included 36 males and 34 females with a mean age of 33.24+/-20.40 years (range, 0.5-84 years). There were 22 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms during hospitalization isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases, while 48 cases remained asymptomatic throughout the course of disease. Of 70 asymptomatic patients, 14 (14/70, 20%) had underlying diseases, 3 (3/70, 4.3%) had drinking history, and 11 (11/70, 15.7%) had smoking history. 22 patients developed symptoms onset of fever (4/22, 18.2%), cough (13/22, 59.1%), chest discomfort (2/22, 9.1%), fatigue (1/22, 4.5%), pharyngalgia (1/22, 4.5%) during hospitalization; only one (1/22, 4.5%) patient developed signs of both cough and pharyngalgia. Abnormalities on chest CT were detected among 35 of the 69 patients (50.7%) after admission, except for one pregnant woman had not been examined. 4 (4/70, 5.7%) and 8 (8/70, 11.4%) cases showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. With the effective antiviral treatment, all the 70 asymptomatic infections had been discharged, none cases developed severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit, or died. The mean time from nucleic acid positive to negative was 13.2+/-6.84 days. Cox regression analysis showed that smoking history (P=0.028, hazard ratio=4.49, 95% CI 1.18-17.08) and existence of pulmonary disease (P=0.038, hazard ratio=7.09, 95% CI 1.12-44.90) were risk factors of the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carries. Conclusion: The initially asymptomatic patients can develop mild symptoms and have a good prognosis. History of smoking and pulmonary disease was prone to illness onset in asymptomatic patients, and it is necessary to be highly vigilant to those patients. Copyright The author(s).

AB  - Background: Substances that can be vaped include nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and a range of synthetic drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the "Monitoring the Future" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12th graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12th-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.

AB  - We discuss the implications of possible contagion of COVID-19 through e-cigarette aerosol (ECA) for prevention and mitigation strategies during the current pandemic. This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1-2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6-200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a "control case" of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44-176% for speaking 6-24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.

AB  - This study was to observe smoking behaviours and infection control behaviours in smokers at outdoor smoking hotspots during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We conducted unobtrusive observations at nine hotspots during 1 July 2019-31 January 2020 (pre-outbreak, 39 observations), 1 February-30 April 2020 (outbreak, eight observations), and 1 May-11 June 2020 (since-outbreak, 20 observations). Sex, age group, type of tobacco products used, duration of stay, group smoking behaviours, face mask wearing and infection control behaviours of smokers, and mask wearing of non-smoking pedestrians were observed. Compared with pre-outbreak, lower volumes of smokers were observed during outbreak and since-outbreak. Smokers gathered more in a group (24.5% and 25.8% vs. 13.4%, respectively) and stayed longer (91.5% and 83.6% vs. 80.6% stayed >=1 min) during outbreak and since-outbreak than pre-outbreak. Ninety-six percent smokers possessed a face mask. While smoking, 81.6% of smokers put the mask under the chin and 13.8% carried it in the hand, 32.4% did not wear a mask immediately after smoking, 98.0% did not sanitize hands, and 74.3% did not keep a distance of at least one metre. During the COVID-19 pandemic, smokers gathered closely and stayed longer at the hotspots, and few practised hand hygiene, all of which may increase the risk of infection.

AB  - Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, health care exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled in a population-based study before the pandemic (n = 67 cancer patients; n = 256 noncancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to 4.18) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 5.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases., METHODS: Physician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. Age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis, disease activity and medications were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. Analyses were further stratified according to rheumatic disease category., RESULTS: Of 3729 patients (mean age 57 years, 68% female), 390 (10.5%) died. Independent factors associated with COVID-19-related death were age (66-75 years: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.22; >75 years: 6.18, 4.47 to 8.53; both vs <=65 years), male sex (1.46, 1.11 to 1.91), hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease (1.89, 1.31 to 2.73), chronic lung disease (1.68, 1.26 to 2.25) and prednisolone-equivalent dosage >10 mg/day (1.69, 1.18 to 2.41; vs no glucocorticoid intake). Moderate/high disease activity (vs remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death (1.87, 1.27 to 2.77). Rituximab (4.04, 2.32 to 7.03), sulfasalazine (3.60, 1.66 to 7.78), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate or tacrolimus: 2.22, 1.43 to 3.46) and not receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (2.11, 1.48 to 3.01) were associated with higher odds of death, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Other synthetic/biological DMARDs were not associated with COVID-19-related death., CONCLUSION: Among people with rheumatic disease, COVID-19-related death was associated with known general factors (older age, male sex and specific comorbidities) and disease-specific factors (disease activity and specific medications). The association with moderate/high disease activity highlights the importance of adequate disease control with DMARDs, preferably without increasing glucocorticoid dosages. Caution may be required with rituximab, sulfasalazine and some immunosuppressants. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in the U.S. on 31 January 2020 in response to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On 20 March 2020, the President of the U.S. proclaimed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. constituted a national emergency, retroactive to 1 March 2020. Between 1 January and 30 September 2020, a total of 53,048 Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries were identified as confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 infection. The majority of cases were male (69.1%) and 45.4% were aged 20-29 years. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these cases varied by beneficiary type (active component service members, recruits, Reserve/Guard, dependents, retirees, and cadets). Of the total cases, 35.8% had been diagnosed with at least 1 of the comorbidities of interest, and 20.0% had been diagnosed with 2 or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidities present in COVID-19 cases were any cardiovascular diseases(12.7%), obesity or overweight (11.1%), metabolic diseases (10.5%), hypertension (9.9%), neoplasms (7.9%), any lung diseases (7.5%), substance use disorders, including nicotine dependence (5.4%), and asthma (3.2%). There were a total of 1,803 hospitalizations (3.4%) and 84 deaths (0.2%).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of osteoporosis is an important consideration for patients with femoral neck fractures due to the morbidity and mortality it poses. The input of orthogeriatric teams is invaluable in coordinating secondary fragility fracture prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid restructuring of health care teams and led to the redeployment of orthogeriatricians., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact COVID-19 had on the secondary prevention of fragility fractures among patients with femoral neck fractures, and to optimize management in this population., METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of patients with femoral neck fractures before and after the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A reaudit was conducted following the development of our new mnemonic, "MRS BAD BONES," which addressed key factors in the assessment and management of osteoporosis: medication review, rheumatology/renal advice, smoking cessation; blood tests, alcohol limits, DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan; bone-sparing medications, orthogeriatric review, nutrition, exercise, supplements. The Fisher exact test was used for comparison analyses between each phase., RESULTS: Data for 50 patients were available in each phase. The orthogeriatric team reviewed 88% (n=44) of patients prelockdown, which fell to 0% due to redeployment, before recovering to 38% (n=19) in the postintervention period. The lockdown brought a significant drop in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements from 81.6% (n=40) to 58.0% (n=29) (P=.02); of bone-sparing medications from 60.7% (n=17) to 18.2% (n=4) (P=.004), and DEXA scan requests from 40.1% (n=9) to 3.6% (n=1) (P=.003). Following the implementation of our mnemonic, there was a significant increase in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements to 85.7% (n=42) (P=.003), bone-sparing medications to 72.4% (n=21) (P<.001), and DEXA scan requests to 60% (n=12) (P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The redeployment of the orthogeriatric team, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in the study population. The "MRS BAD BONES" mnemonic significantly improved management and could be used in a wider setting. Copyright Alastair Stephens, Hannah Rudd, Emilia Stephens, Jayne Ward.

First, we evaluated changes in tobacco use from pre to post campus closure focusing on smoking and electronic nicotine vaping frequency (days) and quantity (cigarettes/cartridges per day). Also, given the potential protective effects of pausing (temporarily or permanently discontinuing) smoking or vaping, we evaluated its predictors. We hypothesized that generalized anxiety and moving home would increase the odds of pausing. We also explored effects of COVID-related news exposure and seeking on tobacco use. We re-contacted young adults two years after they completed a study on alcohol and marijuana co-use. A subset (N = 83; 26.6% of the 312 respondents) were enrolled in college and reported use of cigarettes (n = 35) and/or e-cigarettes (n = 69) in the week prior to their campus closing (PC). Paired sample t-tests compared smoking and vaping frequency and quantity PC to past-week use since closing (SC). Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine predictors of pausing. Both smoking and vaping frequency decreased from PC to SC; however, decreased frequency did not correspond to reduced quantity. Twenty-four participants (28.9%) paused past-week use SC. Higher anxiety and moving home (versus living independently) were related to increased odds of pausing, whereas COVID-19 related news exposure and seeking were related to decreased odds of pausing. Characterizing COVID-19 related tobacco use change provides insights into how college students respond to novel health threats and informs potential interventions. Copyright 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors including age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use, has been reported in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who experienced adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death., RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9-15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models., CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presents an unprecedented diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians. Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 x 10(9) vs 4.6 x 10(9) neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk. The benefits of surgical management must be balanced against the potential risks to health-care workers.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for severe disease and death from respiratory infection. Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the potential utility in assessing level of worry about COVID-19, a transdiagnostic construct, among combustible cigarette smokers to better understand cognitive-affective factors that may maintain smoking behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Pan-immunoglobulin assays can simultaneously detect IgG, IgM and IgA directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig). In this work, we aim to evaluate a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) regarding analytical, diagnostic, operational and clinical characteristics. Our work takes the form of a population-based study in the principality of Liechtenstein, including 125 cases with clinically well-described and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1159 individuals without evidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 cases were tested for antibodies in sera taken with a median of 48 days (interquartile range, IQR, 43-52) and 139 days (IQR, 129-144) after symptom onset. Sera were also tested with other assays targeting antibodies against non-RBD-S1 and -S1/S2 epitopes. Sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 93.2-99.1), whereas specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.4-99.9). Antibody levels linearly decreased from hospitalized patients to symptomatic outpatients and SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms (p < 0.001). Among cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers (p = 0.04), and patients with fever had higher antibody levels than patients without fever (p = 0.001). Pan-SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig in SARS-CoV-2 infection cases significantly increased from first to second follow-up (p < 0.001). A substantial proportion of individuals without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed non-S1-RBD antibody reactivities (248/1159, i.e., 21.4%, 95% CI, 19.1-23.4). In conclusion, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig assay offers favorable and sustained assay characteristics allowing the determination of quantitative associations between clinical characteristics (e.g., disease severity, smoking or fever) and antibody levels. The assay could also help to identify individuals with antibodies of non-S1-RBD specificity with potential clinical cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding risk factors of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vis-a-vis asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, severe disease and death is important., METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted through telephonic interviews among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Jodhpur, India from 23 March to 20 July 2020. Contact history, comorbidities and tobacco and alcohol use were elicited using standard tools., RESULTS: Among 911 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 47.5% were symptomatic, 14.1% had severe COVID-19 and 41 (4.5%) died. Older age, working outside the home, cardiac and respiratory comorbidity and alcohol use were found to increase the risk of symptomatic disease as compared with asymptomatic infection. Current tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.26 to 0.78]) but not smokeless tobacco use (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.55 to 1.19]) appeared to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease. Age >=60 y and renal comorbidity were significantly associated with severe COVID-19. Age >=60 y and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity were found to predispose to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The apparent reduced risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among tobacco smokers could be due to residual confounding owing to unknown factors, while acknowledging the limitation of recall bias. Cross-protection afforded by frequent upper respiratory tract infection among tobacco smokers could explain why a similar association was not found for smokeless tobacco use, thereby being more plausible than the 'nicotinic hypothesis'. Those with comorbidities and age >=60 y should be prioritized for hospital admission. Copyright The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have symptoms ranging from simple symptoms of colds to severe respiratory syndromes. In December 2019, cases of unknown pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan, China., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between occupation and COVID-19 in the Ardabil Imam Khomeini hospital., METHODS: This research was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study. The questionnaires used in this study included demographic information to obtain the required information such as age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying disease, type of drug used, smoking, occupation, hours of work, number of daily clients, use of mask or shield, type of working hours, weight and height and body mass index, number family, place of residence, role in the family, presence of an infected person in the family, communication with the suspect, observance or non-observance of health protocols. Our sample size consisted of 774 subjects, all patients at the Ardabil Imam Khomeini Hospital. The subjects were selected randomly., RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the mean age of patients was 56.70 years, with a standard deviation of 18.20 years. Three hundred and sixty participants (46.5%) were female, and 414 (53.5%) were male. In terms of occupation distribution, 317 patients (41%) were housewives. In addition, 57 people (7.4%) were farmers or ranchers., CONCLUSION: In general, it can be concluded that due to severity of infection and threat posed by Coronavirus and the risk of infections between different occupations like the taxi driver and medical staff, it is very important to find out what jobs are in the big threat.

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether the percentage of lung involvement at the initial chest computed tomography (CT) is related to the subsequent risk of in-hospital death in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19)., Materials and methods: Using a cohort of 154 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 pneumonia cases that underwent chest CT between February and April 2020, we performed a volumetric analysis of the lung opacities. The impact of relative lung involvement on outcomes was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. The primary endpoint was the in-hospital mortality rate. The secondary endpoint was major adverse hospitalization events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, or death)., Results: The median age of the patients was 65 years: 50.6 % were male, and 36.4 % had a history of smoking. The median relative lung involvement was 28.8 % (interquartile range 9.5-50.3). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 16.2 %. Thirty-six (26.3 %) patients were intubated. After adjusting for significant clinical factors, there was a 3.6 % increase in the chance of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.036; 95 % confidence interval, 1.010-1.063; P=0.007) and a 2.5 % increase in major adverse hospital events (OR 1.025; 95 % confidence interval, 1.009-1.042; P=0.002) per percentage unit of lung involvement. Advanced age (P=0.013), DNR/DNI status at admission (P<0.001) and smoking (P=0.008) also increased in-hospital mortality. Older (P=0.032) and male patients (P=0.026) had an increased probability of major adverse hospitalization events., Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, more lung consolidation on chest CT increases the risk of in-hospital death, independently of confounding clinical factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the clinical care of well-established diseases, randomized trials, literature and research are supplemented by clinical judgment to understand disease prognosis and inform treatment choices. In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making. However, lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation of an impending crisis or pandemic., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a 'patients-like-me' framework to predict COVID-19 patient deterioration using a retrospective cohort of similar respiratory diseases., METHODS: Our framework used COVID-like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from an academic medical center, 2008-2019. Fifteen training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purpose. Two machine learning (ML) models were developed, one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features., RESULTS: Compared to the COVID-like cohorts (n=16,509), the COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of Hispanic ethnicity, lower proportion of smoking history and fewer comorbidities (P <0.001). COVID-19 patients had a lower IMV rate (15.1 vs 23.2, P=0.016) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 vs 4.1, P <0.001) compared to the COVID-like patients. In the COVID-like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUV > 0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the best performing model of predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUC: 0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all four COVID-like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUC: 0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc.). Our models suffered from class imbalance, that resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values., CONCLUSIONS: We provided a feasible framework for modeling patient deterioration using existing data and AI technology to address data limitations during the onset of a novel, rapidly changing pandemic., CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - COVID-19 has caused over 300,000 US deaths thus far, but its long-term health consequences are not clear. Policies to contain the pandemic have led to widespread economic problems, which likely increase stress and resulting health risk behaviors, particularly among women, who have been hardest hit both by job loss and caregiving responsibilities. Further, women with pre-existing disadvantage (e.g., those without health insurance) may be most at risk for stress and consequent health risk behavior. Our objective was to estimate the associations between financial stressors from COVID-19 and health risk behavior changes since COVID-19, with potential effect modification by insurance status. We used multilevel logistic regression to assess the relationships between COVID-19-related financial stressors (job loss, decreases in pay, trouble paying bills) and changes in health risk behavior (less exercise, sleep, and healthy eating; more smoking/vaping and drinking alcohol), controlling for both individual-level and zip code-level confounders, among 90,971 US women who completed an online survey in March-April 2020. Almost 40% of women reported one or more COVID-19-related financial stressors. Each financial stressor was significantly associated with higher odds of each type of health risk behavior change. Overall, reporting one or more financial stressors was associated with 56% higher odds (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.51, 1.60) of reporting two or more health risk behavior changes. This association was even stronger among women with no health insurance (OR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.97, 3.07). COVID-19-related economic stress is thus linked to shifts in health risk behaviors among women, which may have physical health consequences for years to come. Further, the relationship between financial hardship and health risk behavior among women may be modified by health insurance status, as a marker for broader socioeconomic context and resources. The most socioeconomically vulnerable women are likely at highest risk for long-term health effects of COVID-19 financial consequences. Copyright 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is currently a serious global issue. Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions. Copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Context: Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has had effects on the various functions of the renal system. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dangerous and broadly spread pathological illness., Objective: In this review, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI., Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before May 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: "Coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" or "COVID-19" or "AKI" or "renal failure" or "nephrology"., Setting: This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia., Results: The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChRalpha7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-kappaB (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated., Conclusions: The research team concluded that the dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system could explain most of the clinical features of severe COVID-19.

AB  - The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral health, including tobacco use, are not fully known. The current study sought to measure the perceived impact of COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York on smokers enrolled in four smoking cessation trials between March 2020 and July 2020. The survey collected quantitative data regarding life changes due to COVID-19, health/exposure status, and the impact on their cessation attempt (e.g., motivation to quit, change in triggers). The questionnaire collected qualitative data to better understand how such changes could explain changes in smoking behavior. Of the 42 participants surveyed, approximately half indicated that COVID-19 changed their motivation and ability to quit or remain quit. Among those who reported that it was easier to quit following the stay-at-home orders (n = 24), most attributed this to concerns regarding the severity of COVID-19 among smokers. Among those who reported more difficulty quitting (n = 15), most attributed this to their increased stress due to the pandemic and the inability to access activities, places, or people that could help them manage triggers. Given public health warnings of continued surges in COVID-19, these data provide insight into who may benefit from further smoking cessation support should existing restrictions or new stay-at-home orders be enacted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of critical importance to overcome the global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2., FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19 x 10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04 x 10-12). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32 x 10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples., INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease., FUNDING: The Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the British Heart Foundation and UK Research and Innovation.

AB  - In the summer of 2019, there was a rise in clusters of adolescents and young adults in the United States reporting to emergency departments with acute respiratory distress related to use of e-cigarette (electronic cigarette) or vaping. The number of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury continued to rise through the summer before peaking in September 2019. Through the efforts of state and federal public health agencies, officials were able to define the condition, identify the relationship of the respiratory injury to tetrahydrocannabinol-containing products, and stem the rise in new cases. In this report, we present a comprehensive review of the clinical characteristics and features of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury and guidelines for patient care and management to inform and navigate clinicians who may encounter these patients in their clinical practice.

AU  - Rampal, L

PY  - 2021
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Malaysia on the 25 January 2020. By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020. The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups. There is also a need to expedite the tabling of Tobacco Control Bill in coming parliament session which is long overdue. H.E. the King of Malaysia has called on all Malaysians to put aside political, racial and religious differences and show the spirit of loyalty, humanitarianism and steadfastness in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations., RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (+/-10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic. Copyright 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We intend to identify some probable risk factors that are responsible for the severity of COVID-19 using a meta-analysis., METHODS: The literature exploration lasted up to 18 April 2020 and through PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Cochrane Library we have identified 10 pertinent publications. To paraphrase the outcomes of autonomous researches, we have performed a random-effect meta-analysis., RESULTS: A total of 2272 patients' information was extracted from the selected literature. We have found gender (male) (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.54), hypertension (RR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.04), diabetes (RR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.98), fatigue or myalgia (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35), and smoking history (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.35) are potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. We found fever (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.22), cough (1.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.30) and diarrhoea (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.40) as insignificant risk factors for COVID-19 severity., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research may be beneficial to identify patients with higher risks to provide additional medical attention from the very beginning of the treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of race and socioeconomic status on clinical outcomes has not been quantified in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan., PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction., MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment., KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531-56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850-85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income ($10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89, 0.96), p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage, which is closely associated with race, is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage should be used to inform policies that aim to reduce COVID-19 disparities in the Black community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, 750 000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae., METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged >=18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression., FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40.0 (30.0 to 53.0). 1397 (66.9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87.5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64.0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 12.0) and 1481 (70.9%) were given propofol for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 11.0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81.6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10.0 days (6.0 to 15.0) and 1147 (54.9%) were delirious for a median of 3.0 days (2.0 to 6.0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p<=0.04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0.0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5.0 days (0.0 to 14.0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0.01). 601 (28.8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU., INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19., FUNDING: None., TRANSLATIONS: For the French and Spanish translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

PY  - 2020
AB  - The year of 2020 teaches us to prevent is always better than to cure. It is an old phrase that is being used for decades, but it is never been implemented cordially by our society nowadays. Covid-19 is a good lesson that reminds us to carefully prevent the spread of coronavirus which is now a pandemic worldwide. People now wash their hands more often and clean, wear a mask everywhere - everytime, do physical distancing, do healthy lifestyle such as physical activity, healthy diet, and consume multivitamins. They obey the cough and sneeze etiquette. Prevention awareness is never been such popular like todays.For internal medicine specialist, the role for prevention is very broad. Besides we still have a role in primary prevention, we can take our part in both secondary and (of course) tertiary prevention. Primary prevention can be defined as an action not allow a disease to occur, for examples vaccination (for internal medicine specialist more specific as adult vaccination), smoking cessation, physical activity (exercise) and healthy diet. Health promotion and prevention is the core of primary prevention. Secondary prevention aims to detect the disease as early as possible, in at risk population, such as mammography for breast cancer, swab test for Covid-19, colonoscopy for colon cancer in high risk patients. Last, tertiary prevention propose to hamper the progress of clinical disease and prevent more severe complications of the disease, for examples cardiac rehabilitation, or medications for prevent chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes or hypertension. It is overlapping the curative or treatment strategies as it is states "to cure is to prevent". In 2020, in which each underlying conditions require effective treatment and each disease should be prevented. We are now facing the era of preventive medicine. As an internal medicine specialist, we need to put in mind a philosophy of prevention in every of our action towards patient's care and services.

AB  - In view of a recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a high demand for production of a vaccine to prevent this disease. Recent studies indicate that SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spike protein (S protein) and its truncated fragments are considered the best candidates for generation of the recombinant vaccine. Toward the development of a safe, effective, and inexpensive vaccine candidate, we have expressed the N-terminal fragment of SARS-CoV S protein (S1) in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants. Incorporation of the S1 fragment into plant genomes as well as its transcription was confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analyses. High levels of expression of recombinant S1 protein were observed in several transgenic lines by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Plant-derived antigen was evaluated to induce the systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice. Mice showed significantly increased levels of SARS-CoV-specific IgA after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing S1 protein. Sera of mice parenterally primed with tobacco-derived S1 protein revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-specific IgG as detected by Western blot and ELISA analysis.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and age have been pointed at as factors that influence on the progression of COVID-19; however, evidence for other conditions is inconclusive., Objective: To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression., Method: Data on >= 20-year-old confirmed cases (n = 159,017) were analyzed. Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables., Results: Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying. The risk for COVID-19 severity was lower as age was more advanced. Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID-19., Conclusion: In the Mexican population, the risk of COVID-19 progression associated with comorbidities was higher in young adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lockdown due to COVID-19 influenced food habits and lifestyles with potential negative health impact. This study aims to identify patterns of change in eating habits and physical activity during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain and to identify associations with sociodemographic factors and usual habits., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1155 adults recruited online to answer a 10-section questionnaire. The protocol assessed usual diet by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, usual physical activity (PA) and supplement use, dietary changes, sedentary time, PA, exposure to sunlight, sleep quality, and smoking during confinement. Patterns of dietary change were identified by factor analysis. Factor scores were included in cluster analysis together with change in PA., RESULTS: Six patterns of dietary change were identified that together with PA changes during lockdown defined three clusters of lifestyle change: a cluster less active, a more active cluster, and a third cluster as active as usual. People who were usually less active were more likely to be classified in the cluster that increased physical activity in confinement. Scores of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style dietary pattern were higher in this group. Conclusions: Different patterns of change in lifestyles in confinement suggest the need to tailor support and advice to different population groups.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted worldwide, which contributed to various psychological problems (such as fear, depression, and anxiety) among the general population in China. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms among Chinese adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Chinese adults was conducted during 17-29 February 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Results: A total of 3,399 respondents were included in the analysis. It was observed that 14.2% (481/3,399) of the participants were screened positive for depressive symptoms. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age (OR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), smoking (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.10-2.26), self-rated health (good: OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37-0.66; fairly: OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.80), having greater support scores (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), knowledge about the main symptom of COVID-19 (very clearly: OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.79; relatively clearly: OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.79), and staying in Wuhan within 3 months before the outbreak of epidemic (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34-2.38) were associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the general population in China had depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Routine screening and targeted interventions for depression are needed among high-risk depressed individuals during the COVID-19 epidemic. Copyright 2020 Peng, Lai, Du, Li, Tian and Gan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding the association between preexisting cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the outcomes of patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained., RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P < 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P < 0.001) and invasive MV (P < 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P < 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3% vs. 1.6%; P < 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51-3.90; P < 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06-5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death., CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, the patients with confirmed COVID-19 with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs had worse clinical outcomes. Caution is required in dealing with these patients at triage. Copyright 2021 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

PY  - 2020
AB  - COVID-19 has affected all countries globally. We explore associations between the change in new COVID-19 registered cases per million population and various macroeconomic and well-being indicators in 38 European countries over a 2-month period (1st April-31st May 2020). A statistically significant (p = 0.002) negative association was estimated between the change in new COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita, after controlling for key health determinants including public expenditure on health, life expectancy, smoking tobacco and sanitation. The country with the highest GDP per capita in Europe (i.e., Luxemburg) was found to experience the lowest change in new COVID-19 cases within the time period whilst the opposite was found for countries with lower GDP per capita (i.e., Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania). The outcomes of this study indicate that, in the first wave of the pandemic in Europe, a country's GDP per capita might be associated with a lower rate of new COVID-19 cases. The study concludes by suggesting that in European regions a country's economic performance should be a critical health priority for policy makers. Copyright 2021 Pardhan and Drydakis.

Countries reporting >25 COVID-19 related deaths until 8 June 2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, population >65 years, average body mass index and smoking prevalence); economic parameters (gross domestic product per capita); environmental parameters (pollution levels and mean temperature (January-May); comorbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer); health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10 000 population); international arrivals; the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19; BCG vaccination coverage; UV radiation exposure; and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data., PRIMARY OUTCOME: Country-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase., PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK and the USA., RESULTS: Of all country-level determinants included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (95% CI -0.034 to -0.002)), were significantly associated with the natural logarithm of the mean death rate., CONCLUSIONS: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent related deaths. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preliminary reports indicated that smokers could be less susceptible to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, once infected an increased risk of severe disease is reported. We investigated the association between smoking and COVID-19 during an outbreak of the disease on a naval vessel., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on the 1769 sailors of a same navy aircraft carrier at sea exposed at the same time to SARS-CoV2 to investigate the link between tobacco consumption and Covid-19., RESULTS: Among the 1688 crewmembers (87% men; median age= 28 (IQR 23-35)) included, 1279 (76%) developed Covid-19 (1038 (62%) RT-PCR-positive and 241 (14%) with only clinical signs). One hundred and seven patients were hospitalized. The univariable analysis odds ratio (OR) for Covid-19 infection was 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.78; P<0.001) for current smokers vs. former and nonsmokers; sex, body mass index or blood group had no significant impact. Crewmembers >50 years old had an increased risk of contracting Covid-19 (OR, 2.84 [95% CI, 1.30-7.5]; P=0.01). Multivariable analysis retained the lower risk of current smokers becoming infected (OR, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]; P<0.001) and age >50 years was significatively associated with Covid-19 (OR, 2.6 [1.17-6.9]; P=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as an efficient protection against infection. Mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research., IMPLICATIONS: Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and Covid-19. Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significant lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71%) versus former and non smokers (80%). This finding strongly supports the need for further research on nicotine physiological pathway and its impact on COVID-19 infection whilst emphasizing that tobacco smoking should not be considered as an efficient protection against COVID-19.

AB  - There has been a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driven by westernization, urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. The prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors vary considerably in SSA between countries and the various sub-populations. A study documented the prevalence of stroke ranging from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43%, and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. The numbers of these NCD cases are predicted to rise over the next decade. However, in the context of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, with the rising cases, lockdowns and deaths recorded worldwide, many people living with NCDs may find accessing care more difficult. The majority of the available resources on the subcontinent have been diverted to focus on the ongoing pandemic. This has caused interruptions in care, complication management, drug pick-up alongside the almost neglected silent NCD epidemic, with major consequences for the health system post the COVID-19 era. We explore the issues surrounding the continuity of care and offer some solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa.

AU  - Kengara, Fredrick O
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: The economic burden caused by death and disease in the world is credited mainly to tobacco use-currently linked to approximately 8,000,000 deaths per year with approximately 80% of these faralities reported in low and middle income economies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 7,000,000 deaths are attributed to direct tobacco use, while approximately 1,200,000 non-smokers exposed to second hand cigarette smoke die every year. Accordingly, tobacco use is a major threat to the public health infrastructure; therefore, proper cessation interventions must be put in place to curb tobacco abuse and ease economic and social burdens caused by the tobacco epidemic., Methods: A systematic review was conducted to investigate how scientific efforts have been advanced towards harm reduction among smokers and non-smokers. Relevant articles published during the period 2010-2020 in PubMed, Crossref, Google scholar, and Web of Science were used in this study. The articles were selected based on health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco cessation and emerging diseases, including Covid-19. Various cessation strategies have been identified although their efficiency is yet to match the desired results., Results: A series of carcinogenic chemicals are generated during cigarette smoking resulting in serious health complications such as cancer and mutagenesis. The precursors for tobacco induced diseases are toxic and carcinogenic chemicals of the nitrosamine type, aldehydes, polonium-210 and benzo[a]pyrene, which bio-accumulate in the body system during cigarette smoking to cause disease. Rehabilitation facilities, use of drugs to diminish the desire to smoke, heavy taxation of tobacco products and warning labels on cigarettes are some of the cessation strategies employed towards curbing tobacco abuse., Conclusion: The need for further research to develop better methods and research based policies for safe cigarette smoking and workable cessation strategies must be a priority in order to deal with the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to promote tobacco cessation and abstinence are recommended in this review as a sure measure to mitigate against the deleterious impacts caused by cigarette smoking and tobacco abuse.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of any underlying heart condition could influence outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive., RESULTS: HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p < 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95% CI 1.29-2.03; p < 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p < 0.001), and mortality (39.7% vs. 15.5%; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19. Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during in-hospital stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first reported in Malaysia in March 2020. We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19., METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists., RESULTS: In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [+/-SD], 21.64+/-2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19., CONCLUSION: We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thoraxfor early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older agegroups, and not in younger patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide baseline cohort descriptives and assess change in health behaviours since the UK COVID-19 lockdown., DESIGN: A prospective cohort (N = 1,044) of people recruited online, purposively targeting vulnerable populations., METHODS: After a baseline survey (April 2020), participants completed 3 months of daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Dietary, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vaping and substance use behaviours collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with daily EMA surveys over the first 30 days during early lockdown. Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models., RESULTS: 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, participants ate almost one portion of fruit and vegetables less per day (vegetables mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.40, -0.25; fruit -0.57, 95% CI -0.64, -0.50), but showed no change in high sugar portions per day (-0.03, 95% CI -0.12, 0.06). Participants spent half a day less per week doing >=30 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (-0.57, 95% CI -0.73, -0.40) but slightly increased days of strength training (0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.34), increased alcohol intake (AUDIT-C score change 0.25, 95% CI 0.13, 0.37), though did not change smoking, vaping or substance use behaviour. Worsening health behaviour change was associated with being younger, female and higher body mass index., CONCLUSIONS: The cohort reported worsening health behaviours during early lockdown. Longer term changes will be investigated using further waves of data collection. Copyright 2021 The Authors.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Air pollution in the environment and in households is responsible worldwide for almost 9 million preventable premature deaths per year and almost 800,000 such deaths within Europe. Air pollution therefore shortens life expectancy worldwide by almost 3 years. Smoking, a proven cardiovascular risk factor, shortens the mean life expectancy by 2.2 years. Epidemiological studies have shown that air pollution from fine and coarse particulate matter is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Responsible for this are mainly cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, hypertension and also diabetes, which are mainly caused or aggravated by fine particulate matter. After inhalation fine particulate matter can reach the brain directly and also reach the bloodstream via a transition process. There, the particles are absorbed by the blood vessels where they stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vascular wall. They therefore promote the formation of atherosclerotic changes and in this way increase the cardiovascular risks, especially an increase in chronic ischemic heart disease and stroke. Recent studies also reported that in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients a high degree of air pollution is correlated with severe disease courses with cardiovascular complications and pulmonary diseases. This necessitates preventive measures, such as lowering of the upper limits for air pollutants. Individual measures to mitigate the health consequences of fine particulate matter are also discussed.

TI  - Is COVID-19 Gender-sensitive?
AU  - Mukherjee, Shreya

PY  - 2021
AB  - While clinical characteristics exhibit that susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equally likely between males and females, clinical outcomes show that males experience both a higher severity and fatality for COVID-19 infection than females. This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

PY  - 1975
AB  - Individuals with chronic lung disease and their families were selected from the Tecumsch community along with similarly selected families as comparison groups and studied for 1-year periods. Occurence of acute respiratory illness was ascertained weekly by telephone and calculated as an annual rate. Persons with chronic bronchitis not only experienced more acute lower respiratory illness than healthy comparison subjects, but total illness rates were somewhat higher as well. Infection rates were determined from blood samples taken 3 times from each participant during the surveillance year. Antibody tests were performed for respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza types A and B, coronavirus OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Differences in serologic infection rates among the subgroups of the population were similar to those seen in the clinical data, with more frequent infection among those with bronchitis than among the comparison subjects. This finding indicates that some degree of increased susceptibility to actual infection existed among those individuals with bronchitis. Influence of smoking on illness and infection rates was also examined. Infections were, in general, more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but illness rates were reversed, suggesting that perception of disease differed in the 2 groups. Rates of illness and infection of other adults in the families of the index individuals with bronchitis were not influenced by the higher rates seen in the index individuals; however, it was of interest that children of persons with bronchitis did have somewhat higher rates of infection than children of comparison subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the trajectory of respiratory failure in COVID-19 and explore factors associated with risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of 112 inpatient adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12 and April 16, 2020. Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV., RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66% male. In-hospital mortality was 6% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8% (6/47), and 18% (5/28) for those requiring IMV. Obesity (OR 5.82, CI 1.74-19.48), former (OR 8.06, CI 1.51-43.06) and current smoking status (OR 10.33, CI 1.43-74.67) were associated with IMV after adjusting for age, sex, and high prevalence comorbidities by multivariable analysis. Initial absolute lymphocyte count (OR 0.33, CI 0.11-0.96), procalcitonin (OR 1.27, CI 1.02-1.57), IL-6 (OR 1.17, CI 1.03-1.33), ferritin (OR 1.05, CI 1.005-1.11), LDH (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.17) and CRP (OR 1.13, CI 1.06-1.21), were associated with IMV by univariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, smoking history, and elevated inflammatory markers were associated with increased need for IMV in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adaptation is vital to ensure successful healthcare recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hand trauma represents the most common acute emergency department presentation internationally. This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk, when undergoing management within one of the largest specialist tertiary referral centres in Europe, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken in all patients referred to the integrated hand trauma service, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020); all were evaluated for 30-day COVID-19 related death. Random selection was undertaken for patients with hand trauma who either underwent non-operative (control group) or operative (surgery group) management; these groups were prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at 30 days following first intervention (control group) or postoperatively (surgery group)., RESULTS: Of 731 referred patients (566 operations), there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both groups were matched for sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking, preoperative/first assessment COVID-19 symptoms, pre- and postoperative/first assessment isolation and positive COVID-19 contact (p > 0.050). There were no differences in high service satisfaction (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.067) and treatment outcome (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.961) scores, postoperative/first assessment symptoms (1%, 1/100 compared with 0.8%, 2/250; p = 1.000) or proportion of positive tests (7.1%, 1/14 compared with 2.2%, 2/92; p = 0.349), between the control (n = 100) and surgery (n = 250) groups., CONCLUSION: These data support continued and safe service provision and no increased risk to patients who require surgical management. Such findings are vital for healthcare providers when considering service adaptations to reinstate patient treatment.

AU  - Messner, Wolfgang

PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: This study examines the association of contextual factors with the COVID-19 outbreak rate across U.S. counties in its initial phase., Methods: Contextual factors are simultaneously tested at the county- and state-level with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood., Results: The variation between states is substantial and significant (ICC = 0.532, u 0 = 8.20E-04, P < .001). At the state level, the cultural value of collectivism and the contextual factor of government spending are positively associated with the outbreak rate. At the county level, the racial and ethnic composition contributes to outbreak differences, disproportionally affecting black/African, native, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as well as native Hawaiians. Counties with a higher median age and a higher household income have a stronger outbreak. Better education and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Obesity and smoking are negatively related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak., Conclusions: Because of a high variation in contextual factors, policy makers need to target pandemic responses to the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke in the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been shown to be associated with more severe respiratory symptoms and higher mortality, but little knowledge in this regard exists on older populations. We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of acute stroke in geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors., RESULTS: Combined ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 4.15%. 72.7% of events occurred during acute care. Strokes presented with altered state of consciousness and/or delirium in 81.8%, followed by a focal neurological deficit in 45.5%. Ischemic stroke was more frequently unilateral (88.8%) and localized in the middle cerebral artery territory (55.5%). Smoking and a history of previous stroke increased by more than seven (OR 7.44; 95% CI 1.75-31.64; p = 0.007) and five times (OR 5.19; 95% CI 1.50-17.92; p = 0.009), respectively, the risk of stroke. Each additional point in body mass index (BMI) reduced the risk of stroke by 14% (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.98; p = 0.03). In-hospital mortality (32.1% vs. 27.3%; p > 0.999) and institutionalization at discharge (36.4% vs. 21.1%; p = 0.258) were similar between patients with and without stroke., CONCLUSION: Incident stroke complicating COVID-19 in old patients was associated with active smoking, previous history of stroke, and low BMI. Acute stroke did not influence early mortality or institutionalization rate at discharge.

AB  - The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, typically leads to respiratory failure in severe cases; however, cardiovascular injury is reported to contribute to a substantial proportion of COVID-19 deaths. Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the most common risk factors for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients, and the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 disease progression itself may promote the development of cardiovascular injury, increasing risk of in-hospital death. Sex differences in COVID-19 are becoming more apparent as mounting data indicate that males seem to be disproportionately at risk of severe COVID-19 outcome due to preexisting CVD and COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury. In this review, we will provide a basic science perspective on current clinical observations in this rapidly evolving field and discuss the interplay sex differences, preexisting CVD and COVID-19-related cardiac injury.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 is a global public health emergency resulting in lockdowns, associated diet and lifestyle changes and constrained public health delivery., Objective: To investigate the impacts of the COVID-19-induced lockdown in Zimbabwe on nutrition, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking among Zimbabwean population aged >=18 years., Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on demographics (age, gender, place of residence, current employment), food system dimensions, diet and physical activity patterns, stress and anxiety, body image perceptions, lifestyle behaviours like smoking, alcohol intake, screen time and ease of access to health services. Results The participants (n=507) were mostly women (63.0%) between the ages of 31 and 40 years (48.1%) and had tertiary education (91.3%). The lockdown resulted in increase in food prices (94.8%) and decrease in availability of nutritious foods (64%). Most (62.5%) of the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity levels. The prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) was 40.4% and mostly affecting woman (63.5%, p=0.909), 31-40 years age group (49.6%, p=0.886). Based on the Body Mass Index-based Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) 44.5% gained weight, 24.3% lost weight and 31.2% did not have weight change. The paired samples t-test showed that there was a significant increase in perceived body weight (p<0.001). More than half (59.6%) reported having difficulties accessing medicinal drugs and 37.8% growth monitoring services., Conclusions: The lockdown period was associated with increase in food prices, decrease in dietary diversification, elevated GAD symptoms, disrupted diet and consumption patterns. There were low levels of physical activity and perceived weight gained during the lockdown period, thus increasing the risk of overweight and obesity. Further studies incorporating participants of different socioeconomic status are warranted to get more conclusive results. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The aim of this study was to compare COVID-19-related outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant women after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes., METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-45 years) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic renal disease, immunosuppression, age, language, nationality and level of health insurance. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission., RESULTS: The cohort comprised 5183 pregnant and 175 905 non-pregnant women with COVID-19. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation and ICU admission in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs 1.5%, 9.9% vs 6.5%, 8.1% vs 9.9% and 13.0% vs 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had a higher odds of death (odds ratio (OR), 1.84; 95% CI, 1.26-2.69), pneumonia (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.60-2.16) and ICU admission (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.41-2.45) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.25)., CONCLUSION: After adjusting for background demographic and medical factors, pregnancy is a risk factor for death, pneumonia and ICU admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected women of reproductive age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measured by echocardiography and mortality in COVID-19., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases with keywords "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "2019-nCoV" AND "Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion" OR "TAPSE" up until 20 January 2021. The main outcome was mortality; the effect estimate was reported in hazard ratio (HR) which was pooled from the unadjusted and adjusted effect estimate retrieved from the included studies. Mean difference of the TAPSE (in mm) between non-survivors and survivors were pooled., RESULTS: There were 641 patients from 7 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. TAPSE was lower in non-survivors compared to survivors (mean difference -3.74 [-5.22, -2.26], p < 0.001; I2: 85.5%, p < 0.001). Each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.24 [1.18, 1.31], p < 0.001; I2: 0.0%, p = 0.491). In pooled adjusted model, each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.21 [1.11, 1.33], p < 0.001; I2: 45.1%, p = 0.156). Meta-regression indicates that the difference in TAPSE between the non-survivors and survivors were affected by COPD (-0.183, p < 0.001) and PASP (-0.344, p = 0.039). but not age (p = 0.668), male (p = 0.821), hypertension (p = 0.101), diabetes (p = 0.603), CAD (p = 0.564), smoking (p = 0.140), and LVEF (p = 0.452)., CONCLUSION: Every 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with approximately 20% increase in mortality., PROSPERO ID: CRD42021232194.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) firstly emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. After going through the experimental process, the virus was named the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020 which has created a global pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, Alzheimer's, etc. Other predisposing/risk factors consist of smoking and age (elderly people are at higher risk). The 2019-nCoV attacks epithelial cells in all organs, particularly epithelial cells in the lungs, resulting in viral pneumonia. The 2019-nCoV starts its invasion with the attachment and entry into the respiratory tract epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the epithelial cells. The critical problem with 2019-nCoV is its ability in human to the human asymptomatic transmission which causes the rapid and hidden spread of the virus among the population. Also, there are several reports of highly variable and tightly case-dependent clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV2, which made the virus more enigmatic. The clinical symptoms are varied from common manifestations which occurred in flu and cold, such as cough, fever, body-ache, trembling, and runny nose to severe conditions, like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even uncommon/unusual symptoms such as anosmia, skin color change, and stroke. In fact, besides serious injuries in the respiratory system, COVID-19 invades and damages various organs, including the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, and nervous system. Accordingly, to cut the transmission chain of disease and control the infection spread. One of the major solutions seems to be early detection of the carriers, particularly the asymptomatic people with the help of sensitive and accurate diagnostic techniques. Moreover, developing novel and appropriate therapeutic approaches will contribute to the suitable management of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to make comprehensive investigations and study reviews about COVID-19, offering the latest findings of novel therapies, drugs, epidemiology, and routes of virus transmission and pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss new therapeutic outcomes and cover and the most significant aspects of COVID-19, including the epidemiology, biological features, organs failure, and diagnostic techniques.

AB  - Some debates exist regarding the association of diabetes mellitus (DM) with COVID-19 infection severity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to describe and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DM. In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Shariati hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 25, 2020, to April 21, 2020. The clinical and paraclinical information as well as the clinical outcomes of patients were collected from inpatient medical records. A total of 353 cases were included (mean age, 61.67 years; 57.51 % male), of whom 111 patients were diabetics (mean age, 63.66 years; 55.86 % male). In comparison to those without DM, diabetic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have other comorbidities, elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), elevated blood sugar (BS), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The association of DM with severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection (i.e. mechanical ventilation, median length of hospital stay and mortality) remained non-significant before and after adjustments for several factors including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and comorbidities. Based on our results DM has not been associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 infection. Copyright 2020 Mansour et al.

AB  - Olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia, anosmia) is a well-recognized symptom in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Studies of olfactory dysfunction in asymptomatic patients have not been reported. We conducted a study looking for the presence of olfactory dysfunction with an objective assessment tool in asymptomatic Covid 19 and compared it with patients with mild COVID-19 and age-matched controls. We recruited 57 male patients each of Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19, and healthy controls for the study. All participants underwent evaluation of smell threshold by Butanol Threshold test (BTT) and ability to distinguish common odors by Smell identification test. The scores of each test were recorded on a numerical scale. The participants in all three arms were matched for age, history of smoking, and pre-existing medical conditions. The mean scores of the Butanol Threshold test in Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19 and controls were 2.95 +/- 2.25 (0-7.5), 3.42 +/- 2.23 (0-7.5), and 4.82 +/- 1.86 (0-8), respectively. A one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between groups (df 2, MS 53.78, F 11.94, p < 0.005). Intergroup differences using the student T-test showed significantly low BTT scores in Mild COVID-19 (p < 0.005) and asymptomatic (p < 0.005) as compared to control. BTT scores could not distinguish between asymptomatic patients and control. The smell threshold was impaired in asymptomatic Covid 19 and Mild COVID-19. Butanol Threshold Test score could not differentiate between asymptomatic Covid 19 and controls. Copyright Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide. Limited studies showed that smokers were at higher risk of having severe complications and higher mortality. We aimed to analyze the possible correlation between adult tobacco smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality all over the world., METHODS: this correlation study involved a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020., RESULTS: seventy-five countries included with median CFR 3.66%. There was no relationship between adult male or female smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence, respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there was a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the mortality of COVID-19. Each increment of one percentage of adult male smoking prevalence was associated with increase in COVID-19 CFR by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041)., CONCLUSION: there is correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening of tobacco control policies is essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC. This still warrants further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of COVID-19., OBJECTIVES: This observational study compared the prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization in IBD patients with a control population with non-inflammatory bowel disorders., METHODS: This multicentre study, included 2733 outpatients (1397 IBD patients and 1336 controls), from eight major gastrointestinal centres in Lombardy, Italy. Patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire regarding demographic, historical and clinical features over the previous 6 weeks. The prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization for COVID-19 was assessed., RESULTS: 1810 patients (64%) responded to the questionnaire (941 IBD patients and 869 controls). IBD patients were significantly younger and of male sex than controls. NSAID use and smoking were more frequent in controls. IBD patients were more likely treated with vitamin-D and vaccinated for influenza. Highly probable COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms and signs was less frequent in the IBD group (3.8% vs 6.3%; OR:0.45, 95%CI:0.28-0.75). IBD patients had a lower rate of nasopharyngeal swab-PCR confirmed diagnosis (0.2% vs 1.2%; OR:0.14, 95%CI:0.03-0.67). There was no difference in hospitalization between the groups (0.1% vs 0.6%; OR:0.14, 95%CI:0.02-1.17)., CONCLUSION: IBD patients do not have an increased risk of COVID-19 specific symptoms or more severe disease compared with a control group of gastroenterology patients.

AB  - To explore the applicability of MuLBSTA Score in COVID-19 patients, a retrospective analysis was performed on 330 cases of COVID-19 patients in Southeast Hospital of Xiaogan City, Hubei Province. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were described and multilobe infiltrate in CT, bacterial infection, lymphocyte count, smoke in history, history of hypertension, and age distribution in the population of mild and severe patients were analyzed. All included patients were scored according to the MuLBSTA early warning scoring system and its efficacy in early warning of severe symptoms was analyzed. CT feature of infiltration changes on multiple lobes, the absolute value of lymphocyte count of less than 0.8 x 109, accompanied by bacterial infection, history of smoking, history of hypertension, and an age of greater than 60 years old were all statistically significant factors in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis indicated that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the early warning system were 0.651, 0.954 and 0.93, respectively. The MuLBSTA Score has a good early warning effect on severe COVID-19 patients. Copyright 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - (1) Background: Nicotine is implicated in the SARS-COV-2 infection through activation of the alpha7-nAChR and over-expression of ACE2. Our objective was to clarify the role of nicotine in SARS-CoV-2 infection exploring its molecular and cellular activity. (2) Methods: HBEpC or si-mRNA-alpha7-HBEpC were treated for 1 h, 48 h or continuously with 10-7 M nicotine, a concentration mimicking human exposure to a cigarette. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting, migration by cell migration assay, senescence by SA-beta-Gal activity, and anchorage-independent growth by cloning in soft agar. Expression of Ki67, p53/phospho-p53, VEGF, EGFR/pEGFR, phospho-p38, intracellular Ca2+, ATP and EMT were evaluated by ELISA and/or Western blotting. (3) Results: nicotine induced through alpha7-nAChR (i) increase in cell viability, (ii) cell proliferation, (iii) Ki67 over-expression, (iv) phospho-p38 up-regulation, (v) EGFR/pEGFR over-expression, (vi) increase in basal Ca2+ concentration, (vii) reduction of ATP production, (viii) decreased level of p53/phospho-p53, (ix) delayed senescence, (x) VEGF increase, (xi) EMT and consequent (xii) enhanced migration, and (xiii) ability to grow independently of the substrate. (4) Conclusions: Based on our results and on evidence showing that nicotine potentiates viral infection, it is likely that nicotine is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.

TI  - PDE4 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for improvement of pulmonary dysfunctions in Covid-19 and cigarette smoking
AU  - Lugnier, Claire

PY  - 2021
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the binding-site and entry-point for SARS-CoV-2 in human and highly expressed in the lung. Cigarette smoking (CS) is the leading cause of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic CS leads to upregulation of bronchial ACE2 inducing a high vulnerability in COVID-19 smoker patients. Interestingly, CS-induced dysregulation of pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in part contributing into the potential pathogenesis COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, CS-mediated ACE2 activations is not the main pathway for increasing the risk of COVID-19, it appeared that AngII/AT1R might induce an inflammatory-burst in COVID-19 response by up-regulating cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which hydrolyses specifically the second intracellular messenger 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP). It must be pointed out that CS might induce PDE4 up-regulation similarly to the COVID-19 inflammation, and therefore could potentiate COVID-19 inflammation opening the potential therapeutic effects of PDE4 inhibitor in both COVID-19-inflammation and CS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent worldwide, and its individual components obesity, diabetes, and hypertension have been identified as risk factors to develop severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, data on MetS and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 are scarce. This study aims to determine association between MetS and severe disease outcomes, that is, mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) requirement among patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This is a retrospective multihospital cohort study on 1871 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Patient data including demographics, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), smoking, laboratory data, and the clinical course of hospitalization were collected. Multivariable regression was performed adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance, smoking, and comorbidities., RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (median age 66 [interquartile range, IQR 54-75]; 965 (51.6%) males; 1494 (80%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 kg/m2 [IQR 25-35.8]; 573 (30.6%) patients with MetS) were included. Patients with MetS had increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75; P = .004), higher ICU admission (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.36-2.08; P < .001), and increased need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.37; P < .001). Among individual comorbidities, diabetes had significant association with mortality (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = 0.02), ICU admission (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.93; P < .001), and need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.03; P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: MetS is a better prognostic indicator for severe disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19 than its individual components. Patients with MetS had significantly higher mortality, increased ICU admissions, and need for mechanical ventilation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbidities play a key role in severe disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID-19, accounting for other possible confounders, is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. During statistical analysis, possible confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities including, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, any history of cancer and prior liver disease, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke, were accounted for., RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (mean (SD) age, 64.11 (16) years; 965(51.6%) males; 1494 (79.9%) African Americans; 809 (43.2%) with >= 3 comorbidities) were included in the study. During their stay at the hospital, 613 patients (32.8%) died, 489 (26.1%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 592 (31.6%) required ICU admission. In fully adjusted models, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR), 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72; p = 0.01), higher rate of ICU admission (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.68; p = 0.009) and increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; p = 0.01). Additionally, patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55; p = 0.03) in fully adjusted models., CONCLUSION: Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes, in COVID-19 patients. These results can help facilitate efficient resource allocation for critical care services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) depend on disease severity, but the prescribing pattern by severity and drivers of therapeutic choices remain unclear., OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19., METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged >= 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen <= 2, 3-4, and >= 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization., RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of disease severity and other determinants of COVID-19 drug use is necessary for appropriate conduct and interpretation of non-randomized studies evaluating outcomes of COVID-19 treatments.

AU  - Li, Shuai

PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption., METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption., METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Since COVID-19 spread rapidly worldwide, many countries have experienced significant growth in the number of confirmed cases and deaths. Earlier studies have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19, such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature. As there is a lack of studies at the neighborhood-level detailing the spatial settings of built environment attributes, this study explored the variations in the size of the COVID-19 confirmed case clusters across the urban district Huangzhou in the city of Huanggang. Clusters of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed cases in an infectious cluster. The clues ch inducing a high risk of contagions have been evidenced and provided for the decision-making practice responding to the initial stage of possible severe epidemics, indicating that the local public health authorities should implement sufficient measures and adopt effective interventions in the areas and places with a high probability of crowded residents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers., RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Confinement to the home and psychological distress due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to harmful health behaviors, such as overeating, sedentary behavior with reduced physical activity, elevated alcohol and tobacco use and increased screen time causing impaired sleep. All of these behaviors are associated with non-communicable diseases and can interfere with immunity. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. High-energy "Western" diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Alcohol use and tobacco also have detrimental effects on the immune system. Therefore, population-wide body weight control, reduction of smoking rates and limitation of alcohol consumption are important preventive measures. Furthermore, sufficient restorative sleep is needed for adequate immune functioning. Appropriate lifestyle changes in regard to nutrition, exercise, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake may help shift the population distribution of infection risk and aid in preventing severe COVID-19 disease. Large-scale surveys should explore the effects of lifestyle changes, and the provision of reliable lifestyle information and effective interventions to individuals and communities during the pandemic is a pressing need.

AB  - Background and aim of the work The effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 disease is debated with common sense and experts suggesting a deleterious effect and manuscripts worldwide reporting a low prevalence of active tobacco smokers among intensive care unit patients. Methods We categorized countries worldwide into three groups with <25%; 25-45%; >45% of active male smokers with data expressed as median and interquartile range [IQR] and extracted data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths per million inhabitants. We also applied multivariate regression techniques to adjust for several epidemiological factors. Results COVID-19 mortality was 13 (5-24) per million inhabitants in countries with male smokers >45% and 33 (4-133) in countries where male smokers were <25%. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 436 (217-954) and 1139 (302-4084) with data confirmed when dividing data for each continent and when controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions We found a counterintuitive low COVID-19 mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection in countries with high prevalence of male smokers at the global level and within each continent, suggesting that active smoking habit is protective. Further research should urgently investigate which is the possible mechanism of action.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a "toxin-like" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human alpha7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the "toxin-like" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human alpha7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.

AB  - SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic considerably affects health, wellbeing, social, economic and other aspects of daily life. The impact of COVID-19 on blood pressure (BP) control and hypertension remains insufficiently explored. We therefore provide a comprehensive review of the potential changes in lifestyle factors and behaviours as well as environmental changes likely to influence BP control and cardiovascular risk during the pandemic. This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise. We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists. EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom)., METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine., RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform "Screening adviser" to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement. The presented SWOT-analysis of this ongoing implementation process allows to plan and optimize future steps towards a state based and supports EBS program in Ukraine.

AB  - Understanding behavioral responses to epidemics is important in evaluating the broad health consequences of emerging infectious diseases. Building on the economic epidemiology literature, this study investigates individual behavioral responses to the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Korea using a panel of individuals in a nationally representative survey. Results show that exposure to the epidemic led to lasting impacts on smoking and drinking behaviors, indicating that emerging infectious disease outbreaks are motivations for behavioral changes and opportunities for public policy interventions. In particular, individuals in the hardest-hit regions or socially connected persons were more likely to change their risky behaviors, suggesting that intensity of exposure and social interactions are potential mechanisms.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in a change in life routines for tobacco users, but little is known about the rationale underlying these changes. Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss. Few mentioned wanting to quit due to the pandemic. Discussion: Current tobacco users have experienced major changes in their tobacco use routines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AU  - Khot, Wasim Yunus

PY  - 2020
AB  - The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance. There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a considerable number of deaths worldwide. This ecological study aimed to explore the relationship between COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality with smoking, obesity, and underlying conditions in Iran. Methods: Provincial-level COVID-19 data were obtained from the official reports. Two outcomes were assessed: the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Data on underlying health conditions, cigarette smoking, and obesity were obtained from national surveys. Negative binomial regression was used to report incident rate (IRR) ratios. Results: As of April 22, 2020, a total number of 43 950 lab-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations and 5391confirmed COVID-19 deaths were officially reported. Adjusting for underdetection to cover the number of clinically-confirmed COVID-19 cases, a total of 76 962 additional hospitalizations (ie, total lab- and clinically-confirmed hospitalizations = 120 912; 175% increase) and 7558 additional deaths (ie, total lab- and clinically-confirmed deaths = 12 949; 140% increase) were estimated during the same period. Provinces with a higher prevalence of obesity (IRR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.49, 5.10), cigarette smoking (1.81; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.27), hypertension (1.88; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.44), and diabetes mellitus (1.74; 95% CI: 0.96, 3.16) had a higher likelihood of COVID-19 death rates. Conclusion: Inequality in COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality was observed in provinces whose populations had underlying diseases, in particular, obesity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily. Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed., RESULTS: This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress., CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.

AB  - Objective: The low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotine's therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them., Methods: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets., Results: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping., Conclusion: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.

TI  - Do men have a higher case fatality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome than women do?
AU  - Karlberg, J

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative total of 8,099 probable cases and 774 deaths as of July 31, 2003, according to the World Health Organization. In Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, 1,755 SARS cases and 299 deaths had occurred as of September 22, 2003. The authors analyzed data from the Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR. The data series includes details regarding sex, age, and chronic disease history. Using data from early March to September 22, 2003, the authors found that males had a significantly (p < 0.0001) higher case fatality rate than females did, 21.9% versus 13.2%; the relative risk was 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35, 2.05), and it was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.16) after adjustment for age. Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis. The overall crude relative risk of mortality was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.74), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.00). Thus, among SARS patients, males may be more severely affected by the disease than females are. This finding could be related to a nonuniform case definition of SARS disease, a different treatment regimen, a past smoking history, work-environment factors, or gender-specific immune-defense factors, for instance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the modifiable risk factors for ST elevation myocardial infarction is prehospital delay. The purpose of our study was to look at the effect of contamination contamination obsession on prehospital delay compared with other measurements during the Covid-19 pandemic., METHOD: A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was >120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD)., RESULT: The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120-360), 120 (60-180), and 105 (60-180), respectively; P = 0.012). Multivariable logistic regression (model-2) was used to examine the association between 7 candidate predictors (age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, pain-onset time, and coronary artery disease (CAD) history), PI-WSUR C-OCD, and admission month with prehospital delay. Among variables, PI-WSUR C-OCD and admission month were independently associated with prehospital delay (OR 5.36 (2.11-13.61) (P = 0.01); 0.26 (0.09-0.87) p < 0.001] respectively]., CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that contamination obsession was associated with prehospital delay of STEMI patients, however anxiety and depression level was not associated during the pandemic.

AB  - There is widespread concern about treatment of psoriasis in COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment features of the psoriasis patients during the pandemic period. We conducted a study in dermatology clinics of seven different tertiary centers. All adult psoriasis patients who were followed up between 11 March 2020 and 28 June 2020, were phone called or questioned in their visit to their follow-up clinics. A semistructured questionnaire was applied and patients' demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. Of 1322 patients, 52.4% were male, and 47.6% were female. According to the questionnaire responses, 964 (72.9%) of these patients could not communicate with their physician during this period, remained 358 (27.1%) patients contacted the physician by phone, email, or hospital visit. From the patients diagnosed as probable/confirmed COVID-19, 14 were female, and 9 were male. Nine of 23 (39.1%) patients were using biologic treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hospitalization from COVID-19 between the patients using biologics (n = 9) and those who did not (n = 14) (P = 1.00). No mortality was observed among them. Obesity, smoking, age, and accompanying psoriatic arthritis were not among the risk factors affecting the frequency of COVID-19. We only encountered an increased risk in diabetic patients. Also, an exacerbation of psoriasis was observed with the infection. No difference was found in patients with psoriasis in terms of COVID-19 infection in patients who use biologics and those who don't. Copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure, risks and immunity of healthcare workers (HCWs), a vital resource during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, warrant special attention., METHODS: HCWs at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, filled in questionnaires and provided serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody screening by Euroimmun IgG assay in March-April 2020. Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+)., RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4% of those RT-PCR-negative. The rate of previously unidentified cases was 0.7% (8/1067) and asymptomatic ones 0% (0/36)., CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases among HCWs proved rare. An increased risk was associated with Covid-19-dedicated wards. Particularly high rates were seen for wards with liberal HCW-HCW contacts, highlighting the importance of social distancing also among HCWs. Copyright 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

AB  - One of the biggest challenges of public health worldwide is reducing the number of events and deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, has been identified as a potent receptor for SARSCoV-2. In the last decades, ACE inhibition has assumed a central role in reducing cardiovascular and renal events. However, with the advent of COVID-19, attention has been turned to ACE-2 as a possible target to reduce virus binding to different human cells. This review aims to discuss recent developments related to medicinal properties of natural compounds as ACE/ACE-2 inhibitors, which should be highlighted in the future development of studies looking for modulators in SARSCoV-2 infection. Data show that bioactive compounds isolated from several natural products act by inhibiting ACE/ACE2, which changes the entire axis of this system. Of the compounds addressed in this review, 7 phenolic compounds, including quercetin, curcumin, naringenin, luteolin, hesperidin, mangiferin, and gallic acid showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico, and 1, esculetin, decreased ACE-2 expression in vivo. Regarding terpenoids and alkaloids, nimbin, withaferin A, andrographolide, zingiberene and, berberine, piperine and thebaine, respectively, showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico. These findings reinforce the need for future preclinical and clinical studies on these compounds and specific inhibitory effects on ACE-2 of all the other compounds described herein only as nonspecific ACE inhibitors. It is important to mention that some natural compounds such as magnolol, resveratrol, rosmarinic acid, tanshinone IIA, and nicotine have also demonstrated the potential to increase the activity or expression of ACE-2, and could therefore aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on US adults' smoking and quitting behaviors is unclear. We explored the impact of COVID-19 on smoking behaviors, risk perceptions, and reactions to text messages during a statewide stay-at-home advisory among primary care patients who were trying to quit. From May-June 2020, we interviewed smokers enrolled in a 12-week, pilot cessation trial providing text messaging and mailed nicotine replacement medication (NCT04020718). Twenty-two individuals (82% white, mean age 55 years), representing 88% of trial participants during the stay-at-home advisory, completed exit interviews; four (18%) of them reported abstinence. Interviews were thematically analyzed by two coders. COVID-19-induced environmental changes had mixed effects, facilitating quitting for some and impeding quitting for others. While stress increased for many, those who quit found ways to cope with stress. Generally, participants felt at risk for COVID-19 complications but not at increased risk of becoming infected. Reactions to COVID-19 and quitting behaviors differed across age groups, older participants reported difficulties coping with isolation (e.g., feeling disappointed when a text message came from the study and not a live person). Findings suggest that cessation interventions addressing stress and boredom are needed during COVID-19, while smokers experiencing isolation may benefit from live-person supports.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular toxicity as a consequence of nicotine from conventional tobacco cigarette smoking is well documented. However, little is known about the cardiovascular consequences of nicotine e-vaping. We review the literature and report a case series of three cases of major adverse cardiovascular clinical effects post nicotine e-vaping., Case summary: Three patients with known peripheral arterial disease who switched from heavy cigarette smoking consumption to a high-intensity dose of nicotine e-vaping all developed further arterial complications within 6-30 months., Discussion: With the recent epidemic of e-vaping in young individuals and the national outbreak of e-vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI), the dangers of e-vaping are now coming to light. The pulmonary effects are now well described, and this paper highlights three new cases of cardiovascular toxicity associated with e-vaping. The potential role of nicotine e-vaping and the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) will also be discussed. Copyright The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia is a serious adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is very rare in non-diabetic patients. This case report describes a non-diabetic patient without any other chronic diseases, who experienced mild hypoglycemia related to HCQ used for COVID-19 treatment., METHODS: All etiologies causing hypoglycemia were investigated and a 72-hour fast test was performed., RESULTS: A 34-years old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a high fever, cough, and chest pain. The result of his COVID-19 PCR test was positive. He received HCQ for 10 days for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. He experienced fatigue, dizziness, severe headache, weakness and feeling of hunger after discontinuation of HCQ during his isolation at home. Before COVID-19 infection, he never experienced hypoglycemia symptoms. He did not have a history of chronic diseases, drug use, alcohol consumption or smoking. A Seventy two-hour fasting test was performed. He complained about headache and weakness during the 72 hours test period. The PG level was determined as 49 mg/dl during these symptoms. Concurrent insulin and C-peptide levels were <2 mU/mL and 0.553 ng/mL, respectively. ACTH, cortisol, growth hormone, liver and kidney function tests were normal. HbA1c level was 4.7% (28 mmol/mol) (Normal Range %4,5-5,7)., CONCLUSION: Hypoglycemia may be observed as an adverse effect of HCQ used for COVID-19 infection even in patients without chronic diseases and comorbidities. We must be careful while using HCQ for these patients and must warn them about this effect. The warning about hypoglycemia effect of HCQ must be added to COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prediction of COVID-19 disease behavior in the early phase of infection is challenging but urgently needed. MuLBSTA score is a scoring system that predicts the mortality of viral pneumonia induced by a variety of viruses, including coronavirus, but the scoring system has not been verified in novel coronavirus pneumonia. The aim of this study was to validate this scoring system for estimating the risk of disease worsening in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This study included the patients who were treated between April 1 st and March 13 th , 2020. The patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the extent of respiratory failure. MuLBSTA score was applied to estimate the risk of disease worsening in each severity group and we validated the utility of the scoring system., RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were analyzed. Among the 46 patients with mild disease, 17 showed disease progression to moderate or severe disease after admission. The model showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of only 34.5% with a cut-off value of 5 points. Among the 55 patients with mild or moderate disease, 6 deteriorated to severe disease, and the model showed a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4% with a cut-off value of 11 points., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MuLBSTA score is a potentially useful tool for predicting COVID-19 disease behavior. This scoring system may be used as one of the criteria to identify high-risk patients worsening to life-threatening status.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition plays a critical role in the onset and progress of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19., METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 122 patients infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, China, a specialized infectious hospital affiliated with the Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI score was calculated as serum albumin (g/L) + 5 x total lymphocyte count (/nL)., RESULTS: The study population consisted of 105 patients (86.1%) with a common form and 17 patients (13.9%) with a severe form of COVID-19. PNI score significantly decreased from patients with common to severe forms of COVID-19 (P = .029) regardless of sex, age range, and body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P = .030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P = .402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI. Copyright 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Health disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations., Methods: We develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020., Findings: We estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR( t ) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR( t ) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits., Interpretation: The risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap., METHODS: UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, and were asked to log their condition daily. Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of 'classic' symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers., RESULTS: Between 24 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, data were available on 2 401 982 participants, mean (SD) age 43.6 (15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834 437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to report symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.14 (1.10 to 1.18); >5 symptoms 1.29 (1.26 to 1.31); >10 symptoms 1.50 (1.42 to 1.58). The pattern of association between reported symptoms did not vary between smokers and non-smokers., INTERPRETATION: These data are consistent with people who smoke being at an increased risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19.

AU  - Hopkins, D Brett

PY  - 2020
AB  - The aim of this study was to test how youth and young adult e-cigarette users responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Youth and Young Adult Vaping Survey (N = 1,308) included 540 (44.7%) participants that reported differences in their vaping behaviors since the onset of the pandemic. Gender was the only relevant covariate that yielded a significant effect and/or interaction through a multivariate test. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the effect of pandemic onset (pre- vs. during-pandemic), gender (males vs. females), and their interaction on vaping behaviors (days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode). Respondents reported fewer days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [F (3,533) = 52.81, p < 0.001, etap2 = 0.229]. The multivariate effect of gender on the three vaping outcomes was not statistically significant [F (3, 533) = 2.14, p = 0.095, etap2 = 0.012], though the interaction between pandemic onset and gender was [F (3, 533) = 2.86, p = 0.036, etap2 = 0.016]. Males reported fewer episodes of vaping per day [t (262) = 7.40, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 5.19-8.97] and puffs per vaping episode [t (263) = 3.23, p = 0.001, 95% CI:0.292-1.20] during-pandemic than pre-pandemic. Females reported fewer vaping episodes per day during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [t (273) = 5.14, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.76-6.18]. Further, females reported more frequent puffs per vaping episode in comparison to males during-pandemic [t (538) = -2.38, p = 0.017, 95% CI: -2.09-0.200]. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reduce vaping through health promotion messaging. Since females take more puffs per vaping episode overall, they may benefit the most from greater vaping cessation supports. Copyright 2021 Hopkins and Al-Hamdani.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data is conflicting regarding the impact of tobacco smoking in people with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19)., METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study of 9,991 consecutive patients hospitalized in a major New York academic centre between March 7th and June 5th, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The clinical outcomes assessed included risk of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for mechanical ventilation among smokers (current and former). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score models were built to adjust for potential confounders., FINDINGS: Among 9,991 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 2,212 (22.1%) patients were self-reported smokers (406 current and 1806 former). Current smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (propensity score [PS]-adjusted OR 0.91; p=0.46), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.77; p=0.12), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.18; p=0.37), or intubation (PS-OR 1.04; p=0.85). Similarly, former smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.88; p=0.11), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.78), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.95), or intubation (PS-OR 0.93; p=0.57). Furthermore, smoking (current or former) was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.85; p=0.05), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.94; p=0.49), ICU admission (PS-OR 0.86; p=0.17), or intubation (PS-OR 0.79; p=0.06)., INTERPRETATION: Smoking is a well-known risk factor associated with greater susceptibility and subsequent increased severity of respiratory infections. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers may have increased risk and severe pneumonia. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers are believed to have an increased risk of mortality as well as severe pneumonia. However, in our analysis of real-world clinical data, smoking was not associated with increased in-patient mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, in accordance with prior reports.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank., DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: UK Biobank., PARTICIPANTS: 49-83 year olds (in 2020) from a general population study., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes., RESULTS: Among 235 928 participants, 397 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index and higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (RR 1.28 and RR 1.14 per SD increase, respectively), smoking (RR 1.39), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.53), and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.33). Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were both associated with lower risk (RR 0.84 and RR 0.83 per SD increase, respectively). Non-modifiable risk factors included male sex (RR 1.72), black ethnicity (RR 2.00), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.17 per SD increase in Townsend Index), and high cystatin C (RR 1.13 per SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat, less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

TI  - Interleukin 6 in inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer
AU  - Hirano, Toshio
PY  - 2020
AB  - Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved both in immune responses and in inflammation, hematopoiesis, bone metabolism and embryonic development. IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune cells and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-kappaB and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-kappaB followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is a NF-kappaB target, simultaneous activation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-kappaB activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases. Copyright The Author(s) 2020.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Sexual minority persons experience health disparities associated with sexual stigma and discrimination and have a high prevalence of several health conditions that have been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). Current COVID-19 surveillance systems do not capture information about sexual orientation. To begin bridging the gap in knowledge about COVID-19 risk among sexual minority adults, CDC examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults in the prevalence of underlying conditions with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe COVID-19-related illness (3), by using data from the 2017-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). * When age, sex, and survey year are adjusted, sexual minority persons have higher prevalences than do heterosexual persons of self-reported cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease (including myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease), obesity, smoking, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and stroke. Sexual minority adults who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic also have higher prevalences of several of these health conditions than do racial/ethnic minority adults who are heterosexual. Collecting data on sexual orientation in COVID-19 surveillance and other studies would improve knowledge about disparities in infection and adverse outcomes by sexual orientation, thereby informing more equitable responses to the pandemic.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the world is currently facing high morbidity and mortality rates as well as severe disruption to normal societal and social structures. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In a recent publication of The Journal of Pathology, Liu and coworkers highlight the effects of cigarette smoking on ACE2 expression in the respiratory epithelium. The authors studied the effects of acute cigarette smoke exposure in a murine model and confirmed their findings in human lung tissues and gene expression datasets. Their findings demonstrate that cigarette smoking increases ACE2 expression specifically at the apical surface of the airway epithelium. Smoking cessation resulted in lower ACE2 expression, with implications for attenuating the risk of transmission of the virus. The role of ACE2 expression in the development of COVID-19 symptoms is still under investigation, with conflicting results from experimental models on the role of ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury. In this commentary, we highlight the implications and limitations of the study of Liu et al as well as future therapeutic strategies directed towards ACE2. 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Of all patients infected with COVID-19, 95% have mild symptoms, but 5% may experience severe illness. There are reports of myocardial injury associated with the COVID19 infection in middle-aged and old people with baseline cardiac conditions. Acute myocardial injury has been suggested as a marker for disease severity. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between acute coronary syndrome and acute myocarditis; hence detailed history taking, lab tests and imaging will be necessary., Case Presentation: Herein, we described two young patients presenting with chest pain and no significant respiratory symptoms, one without cardiovascular risk factors and another one with diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. COVID-19 was documented with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)., Conclusion: Early Chest CT scan besides coronary CT angiogram (if available) in suspicious cases can help physician to make fast decisions. These two cases both had complication-free hospital stay. Despite markedly high on-admission troponin levels, which is known as a marker of poor prognosis they discharged in good condition. One month follow-up was also uneventful.

AB  - COVID-19 a systemic inflammation involving multiple organs, affecting all age groups, with high mortality rate, severe adverse outcomes, and high economic burden need to be described. A systematic review of systematic reviews conducted. We searched PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane library, COVID-19 resource centers of N Engl. J Med, AHA, and LITCOVID. Certainty of evidences was evaluated by GRADE approach. Meta-analysis according to random effects model was conducted. Seventy-one eligible systematic reviews are included in the study. A total of 86.5% of them had high quality, and 13.5% had medium quality. Meta-analysis results are presented in tabular format, and the remaining results are presented in narration fashion. COVID-19 involves blood vessels, lung, heart, nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal system, kidney, eyes, and other organs and infects adult and children, neonates, pregnant women, and elderly, transmitted via air born and droplet. Comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are HTN 20.7%, CVD 9.6%, DM 9.55%, respiratory diseases 7%, and 9% of cigarette smoking. Prognostic factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases are acute cardiac injury, diagnosed CVD, DM, respiratory disease, and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease severity are CVD and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease progression were fever, shortness of breath, and smoking. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Preventive measures including physical distancing of 2 m and more, using PPE, avoiding social gatherings, quarantine, and isolation have been recommended. Encouraging telemedicine, online training, and homeschooling are highly recommended. Vaccine is approaching, and concerns exist about vaccine with a high efficacy. Modification of CVD and cardiometabolic risk became the cornerstone for sustainable control of pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a complex inflammatory syndrome predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. The clinical and laboratory profile can easily mimic infectious and noninfectious conditions. The exclusion of these conditions is essential to establish the diagnosis. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C knowledge is evolving. The current criteria to establish the diagnosis are not specific and have overlapping features with EVALI, making the accurate diagnosis a clinical challenge during continued COVID-19 transmission within the community., CASE REPORT: Three young adults evaluated at our emergency department for prolonged fever and gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were initially assessed for possible MIS-C due to epidemiologic links to COVID-19 and were eventually diagnosed with EVALI. The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of both entities are explored, as well as the appropriate medical management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Physician awareness of overlapping and differentiating EVALI and MIS-C features is essential to direct appropriate diagnostic evaluation and medical management of adolescents and young adults presenting with systemic inflammatory response during the unfolding pandemic of COVID-19.

Since hypertension is a leading comorbidity in non-survivors of COVID-19, we tested for association between ACE2 gene and hypertension in interaction with specific pre-existing conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 severity., METHODS: Genetic analysis of ACE2 gene was conducted in French-Canadian and British populations., RESULTS: In French-Canadian individuals, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2074192 of ACE2 gene was a risk factor for hypertension in adult obese males [odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.83)] and even more so in obese males who smoked (OR=1.67, CI: 1.24-2.55), but not in lean males, non-smoker males or females. The T allele was significantly associated with severity of hypertension and with earlier penetrance of hypertension in obese smoking males. Significant interaction between the T allele and obesity was present in both sexes. The association of ACE2 (rs233575) genotype with blood pressure was also seen in adolescents but the interaction with obesity was present only in females. Several variants in ACE2 gene were found to be associated with hypertension in obese, smoking males in British individuals of the UK Biobank. In addition, we observed more severe outcomes to COVID-19 in association with ACE2 risk alleles in obese, smoking males., CONCLUSION: This is the first report that ACE2 variants are associated with earlier penetrance and more severe hypertension and with more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in obese smoking males.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore knowledge and attitude about Covid-19, among Syrian refugee mothers in the Governorate of Irbid, where the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Jordan took place., METHODS: This is a cross-section study among Syrian refugee mothers, who were pregnant or having had children. Data was collected through an online questionnaire. The survey link was distributed in April 2020, through the social network's messaging services Facebook and WhatsApp. Contact information was obtained from local community centres and non-governmental organisations in the town of Irbid, the north of Jordan., RESULTS: In total, 389 Syrian refugee mothers participated in the study. It showed that 66% of mother's access information regarding Covid-19. The main sources of information were Facebook 87%, WhatsApp 69%, television 53%, while 21% indicated that they access professional databases or government websites. In general, Syrian refugee mothers were knowledgeable about Covid-19 transmission and prevention. However, they lacked adequate knowledge about transmission of Covid-19 between the mother and the child, and smoking risks associated with Covid-19., CONCLUSIONS: There are gaps in the knowledge and attitude of Syrian refugee mothers in the Governorate of Irbid in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a need for further health education measures. Copyright 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Vulnerable adolescents may lose control over cigarette use within a day or two after smoking their first cigarette, as nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms may appear before actual daily smoking and usually occur at low levels of daily smoking. Moreover, smoking can cause illnesses and promote other types of substance abuse. Therefore, it was deemed essential to adapt the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale to develop and validate the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) in Lebanese adolescents and evaluate whether cumulative cigarette smoking is associated with nicotine dependence and symptoms of dependence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, during the partial sanitary lockdown imposed by the government to limit COVID-19, coinciding with the summer holidays for most Lebanese. The total sample consisted of 564 community-dwelling adolescents aged 13 to 18. A factor analysis was performed using a varimax rotation. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's sphericity test were appropriate. The factors retained corresponded to Eigenvalues > 1. Cronbach's alpha value represented the internal consistency of the scale. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) was used to screen for dependence symptoms. All items of the YACD were extracted, except for items 4 (smoking to concentrate at work) and 18 (smoking as a habit), which yielded a three-factor solution (factor 1 = smoking patterns; factor 2 = positive and negative reinforcements; factor 3 = smoking cessation) with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 56.18%; KMO = 0.784; Bartlett's sphericity test p < 0.001; alphaCronbach = 0.875). The newly generated scale was termed Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) and consisted of 19 items. Higher ACDS scores (higher cigarette dependence) were significantly associated with higher HONC scores (higher symptoms of dependence) (rho = 0.647; p < 0.001). Having deceased (B = 8.54) or divorced (B = 4.26) parents and higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.29) were significantly associated with higher ACDS scores. Higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.05) was significantly associated with higher HONC scores due to cigarettes. This study could validate a new tool to evaluate nicotine dependence among Lebanese adolescents, the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS). This version adapted from the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale is reliable and valuable and correlates well with other scales, such as the HONC. However, further studies are necessary to improve this instrument, adding new questions useful for the diagnosis and evaluation of cigarette dependence.

AB  - Introduction: Older adults constitute the most vulnerable population group to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mexico, their biopsychosocial conditions might intensify their vulnerability., Method: Affiliation to health systems, health conditions and gerontological evaluation of 3,218 older adults were analyzed following the methodology of the PAHO-Mexico Health, Well-being and Aging Survey., Results: 88.6 % of older adults referred being affiliated to health systems; 30.2 %, 52.4 %, 10.3 %, 4.1 % and 5.6 % referred suffering from diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, respectively; 15.6 % reported urinary incontinence, and 11.3%, fecal incontinence; 12.1 % of the women referred having suffered from breast cancer at some point, and 6.3 %, cervical cancer. The habit of smoking tobacco was observed in 11.1 %, risk of malnutrition in 32.8 %, established malnutrition in 4.1 %, functional dependence for basic and instrumental activities of daily life in 16.3 % and 17.6 %, respectively., Conclusion: Comprehensive gerontological evaluation is essential for efficient care of older adults who suffer from COVID-19, and for adequate care of the effects or health conditions at the conclusion of the confinement imposed by the pandemic.

AB  - Twenty-five patients with chronic bronchitis were studied intensively from 1968 to 1972. Viral, bacteriologic, mycologic, and mycoplasmal studies, both serologic and cultural, were carried out in an attempt to determine the role these agents play in exacerbations. All of the usual viral agents associated with exacerbations and 2 members of the coronavirus group, 229E and OC43, were detected. One third (33.6 per cent) of the 116 exacerbations observed could be related to viral infection or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1 exacerbation). Viral infection was also noted to occur during periods of remission but was more commonly associated with periods of exacerbation(P less than 0.001). No interrelationship between viral and bacterial infection was apparent and neither Streptococcus pneumoniae nor Haemophilus influenzae was present more frequently in the sputum of patients in exacerbation. However, the number of S. pneumoniae organisms present in the sputum was significantly greater (P=0.04) during exacerbation than during remission and their presence was significatnly correlated with increases sputum purulence (P LESS THAN 0.01). This was not true of H. influenzae. Ampicillin was effective in clearing the sputum of S. pneumoniae but not of H. influenzae; the reverse was true of tetracycline.

AB  - Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) may be at an increased risk of a severe course due to cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CLD in COVID-19 patients and to analyze the course of the infection, compared with patients with non-liver disease. Material This was a retrospective single center study of all patients with a positive SARS-Cov2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from March 23 to April 30, 2020. Clinical and biochemical data of patients with and without CLD and COVID-19 were collected from the medical records. Result 447 patients with a SARS-Cov2 positive PCR were included, 6.3% had CLD. 69.7% of patients with CLD were male, with a median age of 65.5 years and active alcohol consumption and smoking 75% had non-advanced liver fibrosis and most were Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The hospital admission rate (92.9% vs 47.7% p<0.001), concomitant comorbidities (diabetes 38.5 vs 16.5% p=0.011; obesity 30.8 vs 8.5% p=0.033; cancer 23.1 vs 5% p=0.027 and COPD 19.2 vs 9% p=0.009) and concomitant antibiotics treatment (19.3 vs 5%; p= 0.018) were higher in patients with CLD than those without CLD. In-patient hospital mortality rate were similar in both groups (30.8 vs 19.6% p=0.289). The presence of CLD was not associated with mortality (OR= 1.06; 95% IC= 0.35- 3.18; p=0.924). However, patients with CLD and COVID-19 who were male, obese or under concomitant antibiotic treatment had the highest risk of mortality according to the univariate analysis. Conclusion Patients with CLD had a higher risk of hospital admission, with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 infection associated to other concomitant comorbidities and a suspicion of bacterial co-infection.

AB  - Objective. This study was designed to investigate UK smokers' accounts of impacts of COVID-19 on their smoking, to develop implications for supporting smoking cessation. Design. One hundred and thirty-two smokers aged 19-52 years (mean age 25 years), recruited through an advert distributed through social media and a dedicated Twitter page, completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures. Smokers produced written accounts of how COVID-19 had impacted their smoking. Responses were of unlimited length and completed online 22nd May-22nd June 2020 during UK COVID-19 lockdown. Results. Inductive thematic analysis generated three themes: i) increased smoking as a coping mechanism to deal with anxiety, boredom, stress, and anger in COVID-19 lockdown; ii) lockdown as enabling quitting through lifting social barriers and enabling a focus on health benefits; and iii) no change, avoiding Government/media COVID-19 information due to disbelief, lack of trust, and perceptions of bias. Conclusions. Results demonstrate a need for credible public health messaging on COVID-19 risk aimed at smokers. Implications for supporting smoking cessation are discussed, including maintaining quitting in those "social smokers" who quit during lockdown, and support on stress-management and emotion regulation in those who use smoking as a way to cope with stress, anger, and boredom.

AB  - AIMS: In Danish patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases to explore self-protection strategies and health behaviour including adherence to disease-modifying antirheumatic treatment (DMARD) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and again after the reopening of the society started. Furthermore, to identify characteristics of patients with high levels of anxiety and self-isolation., METHODS: Patients in routine care followed prospectively in the nationwide DANBIO registry were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding disease activity and COVID-19 infection, behaviour in March and June 2020. Responses were linked to patient data in DANBIO. Characteristics potentially associated with anxiety, self-isolation and medication adherence (gender/age/diagnosis/education/work status/comorbidity/DMARD/smoking/EQ-5D/disease activity) were explored with multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: We included 12 789 patients (8168 rheumatoid arthritis/2068 psoriatic arthritis/1758 axial spondyloarthritis/795 other) of whom 65% were women and 36% treated with biological DMARD. Self-reported COVID-19 prevalence was 0.3%. Patients reported that they were worried to get COVID-19 infection (March/June: 70%/45%) and self-isolated more than others of the same age (48%/38%). The fraction of patients who changed medication due to fear of COVID-19 were 4.1%/0.6%. Female gender, comorbidities, not working, lower education, biological treatment and poor European Quality of life, 5 dimensions were associated with both anxiety and self-isolation., CONCLUSION: In >12 000 patients with inflammatory arthritis, we found widespread anxiety and self-isolation, but high medication adherence, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This persisted during the gradual opening of society during the following months. Attention to patients' anxiety and self-isolation is important during this and potential future epidemics.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Women are predicted to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased carer responsibilities, loss of income, worry about the virus and a predominantly female healthcare workforce. Whilst there is emerging evidence that negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be more pronounced for women than men, less attention has focussed on changes to health behaviours and health seeking experienced by women. Similarly, the impact of the pandemic in rural areas has not been investigated in detail. Our research questions were 'have females residing in rural areas experienced changes in alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption, smoking, exercise or health seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'are there differences in health behaviour changes between rural females living with or without children?'. Net increases (scale of 0-1) in consumption of unhealthy food (95% CI 0.05, 0.22) and alcohol (95% CI 0.12, 0.29) were observed. Net decreases (scale of -1 to 0) in visits to the doctor (95% CI -0.23, -0.35) and other health professionals (95% CI -0.40, -0.54) were observed. Compared with females living without children, females who lived with children were significantly associated with increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 4.1), decreased visits to the doctor (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.2) and decreased visits to other health professionals (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.3). Results suggest that public health approaches may be required to support females residing in rural areas to optimise their health behaviours during the pandemic, particularly for those living with children. Policies must be gender responsive to counteract worsening health and social inequities both during and after the pandemic.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some populations being confined to their homes as part of infection control measures. This situation can be hard to cope with due to separation from loved ones, prohibition of regular activities, fear of infection, loss of freedom, and so on. These negative impacts cause considerable psychological stress, and all the more so when the situation continues for an extended period, as was the case in Spain. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of COVID-19 quarantine on the emotional functioning of confined Spanish individuals after 8 weeks of lockdown by means of a cross-sectional study. The possible associations between changes in emotional functioning and demographic variables (age and sex), health habits (physical exercise, following a routine, and smoking), social support, and resilience were also analyzed., Methods: A total of 906 Spanish adults completed an online survey to gather information about their prevailing mood and affects (before and after 8 weeks of lockdown), using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), and other variables related to their habits and protective factors., Findings: As expected, the data indicated an increase in negative affects (e.g., "upset," "afraid," "distressed") and a decrease in positive affects after 8 weeks under lockdown, as well as a general decline in overall mood. The largest increases in negative affects were observed in young adults (18-35 years) and women. We did not find any differences between people who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Adhering to a routine, maintaining the same weight, and moderate physical exercise were associated with fewer negative affects, which indicates they are important protective factors, as are perceived social support and resilience., Conclusion: In order to mitigate the psychological impact of confinement, it is important to develop psychoeducational measures that encourage subjects to adhere to health habits and promote social support and resilience as protective factors. A special preventive focus should be placed on the most vulnerable population groups, namely women and young adults. For a public health lockdown to succeed, its negative consequences must be minimized insofar as possible through adequate knowledge of the risk factors and protective factors, and by means of prevention-oriented organization.

AB  - Little information is available on the beneficial effects of cholecalciferol treatment in comorbid patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the clinical outcome of patients receiving in-hospital high-dose bolus cholecalciferol. Patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and overt COVID-19, hospitalized from 15 March to 20 April 2020, were considered. Based on clinical characteristics, they were supplemented (or not) with 400,000 IU bolus oral cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and the composite outcome (transfer to intensive care unit; ICU and/or death) was recorded. Ninety-one patients (aged 74 +/- 13 years) with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Fifty (54.9%) patients presented with two or more comorbid diseases. Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 +/- 10 days), 27 (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most restrictive lockdowns of any country, inevitably causing stress for many people. Because situations that increase stress and anxiety are associated with higher smoking prevalence, we examined self-reported smoking before and during the lockdown, and analyzed factors associated with reported changes in cigarette consumption., AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown; the final, weighted sample included 261 daily smokers and 71 weekly smokers. We measured psychological distress and anxiety, as well as situational factors, tobacco consumption, and demographic attributes., RESULTS: Nearly half of daily smokers reported smoking more during than before the lockdown, on average, an increase of six cigarettes a day; increased daily cigarette consumption was associated with loneliness and isolation. Most weekly smokers reported either that their smoking during the lockdown had not changed or had slightly reduced., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with increased daily tobacco consumption, and that this increase may be sustained after lockdown. While public health responses to pandemics predictably focus on immediate and obvious consequences, interventions to support recent quitters and those making quit attempts should also form a key component of pandemic planning., IMPLICATIONS: As governments introduce unprecedented measures to manage COVID-19, they need also to consider other public health risks, such as increased smoking among current smokers or relapse among recent quitters. Evidence that loneliness was associated with increased smoking during a lockdown suggests a need for cessation out-reach strategies that promote and support smoke-free practices.

TI  - Electronic Cigarette Users' Perspective on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study Using Twitter Data
AU  - Gao, Yankun
AU  - Xie, Zidian
AU  - Li, Dongmei
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and could develop more severe symptoms if they contract the disease owing to their impaired immune responses to viral infections. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been widely used by individuals worldwide to express their responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes in the attitudes of Twitter users who used e-cigarettes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compare differences in attitudes between e-cigarette users and nonusers based on Twitter data., METHODS: The study dataset containing COVID-19-related Twitter posts (tweets) posted between March 5 and April 3, 2020, was collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface with COVID-19-related keywords. Twitter users were classified into two groups: Ecig group, including users who did not have commercial accounts but posted e-cigarette-related tweets between May 2019 and August 2019, and non-Ecig group, including users who did not post any e-cigarette-related tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling was performed to compare the main topics discussed between the groups., RESULTS: The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 4,500,248 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 187,399 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 11,479,773 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 2,511,659 unique Twitter users in the non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that Ecig group users had more negative sentiment scores than non-Ecig group users. Results from topic modeling indicated that Ecig group users had more concerns about deaths due to COVID-19, whereas non-Ecig group users cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that Twitter users who tweeted about e-cigarettes had more concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform public health practitioners to use social media platforms such as Twitter for timely monitoring of public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and educating and encouraging current e-cigarette users to quit vaping to minimize the risks associated with COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2. This infection can cause mild to very severe respiratory and systemic illness mainly related with a cytokine storm. The epidemiology of COVID-19 is under continuous evolution, and studies are ongoing aiming at identifying the possible factors facilitating the diffusion of this infection. It is documented that air pollution and smoking are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality globally, and can increase the risk of many diseases, including respiratory diseases. Overall, a linear relationship between exposure to atmospheric pollutants and diffusion of the Sars-Cov2 virus seems to exist. However, this correlation, cannot be regarded as a cause-effect relationship. The available data show that air pollution is responsible for inflammation and hyper-activation of innate immunity that are associated with the worst outcomes of covid-19 but do not allow to conclude that atmospheric particulate is responsible for increased contagion. As to smoking, nicotine activation of nicotinic receptors leads to enhanced protease activation, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling through the same pathways (Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) used by the virus increasing the inflammatory/destructive action of the virus itself. The increase in non-communicable diseases and of chronic inflammatory diseases is in line with environmental pollution, related climate changes, and with an augmented susceptibility to infectious diseases with increased contagiousness and morbidity. Restrictive measures to limit environmental pollution are needed worldwide as this represents a threat for human health.

TI  - The temporary ban on tobacco sales in South Africa: lessons for endgame strategies
AU  - Filby, Samantha
AU  - van der Zee, Kirsten
AU  - van Walbeek, Corne
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: The endgame literature recommends that, for a tobacco sales ban to be successful, several demand-side preconditions (eg, low prevalence and effective cessation support) should be in place. The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown., OBJECTIVES: To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning., METHODS: Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban., RESULTS: About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels., CONCLUSIONS: The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.

AB  - AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the changes in smoking addiction levels during the on-going Covid-19 pandemic., METHODS: This study included 104 participants, >=18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio-demographic information and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data., RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre-pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively., CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid-19 in smokers. Health institutions should therefore take advantage of this period and focus more efforts on the cessation of smoking and other substance abuse issues. Copyright 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of global concern. Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclinicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population., RESULTS: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84%) had solid tumors and 31 (16%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age >= 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P < .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease., CONCLUSION: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population. Fragile patients and smokers are entitled to active preventive measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close monitoring in the case of exposure or COVID-19-related symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to study the impact of social isolation, related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, on lifestyles in Italy, with particular reference to physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits. Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics., DESIGN: epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods., RESULTS: the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones., CONCLUSIONS: the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations., METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations., RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94)., CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.

Revealing the health effects associated with smoking has been in the focus of intense research for decades. Due to these research efforts, there is a convincing evidence regarding the negative effects of conventional cigarettes. However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored. The lack of pertinent information regarding the late effects of e-cigarette and hookah does not imply that there is no health risk associated with their consumption. On the contrary, in addition to the regular antismoke measures, pulmonologists and policy makers should do everything to lower the consumption of these alternative products.

It is especially important for smokers to quit now because they are at increased risk of serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a program for smoking cessation in a preanesthesia clinic associated with a southwestern medical center to increase motivation to quit smoking. The evidence-based program involved development of a provider toolkit, a referral process, provider education, and program evaluation. After provider education, the program commenced. Of the 134 current smokers encountered over a 16-week period, most were ready to quit within 30 days (n = 92, 68.66%). Of the smokers who were ready to quit, 50 (37.31%) accepted referral for smoking cessation counseling, treatment, or both. Only 13 (9.70%) of the 134 smokers were already receiving treatment. This program enabled providers to feel more comfortable discussing the implications of smoking, advising smokers to quit, providing education materials, and offering referral services at the appropriate stage of readiness for behavior change.

AB  - This study aims to predict death after COVID-19 using only the past medical information routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs) and to understand the differences in risk factors across age groups. Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65-85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality. The ability to compute precise individual-level risk scores exclusively based on the EHR is crucial for effectively allocating and distributing resources, such as prioritizing vaccination among the general population.

AB  - Introduction: In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world. Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients., Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis., Results: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively., Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.

AB  - Most studies of severe/fatal COVID-19 risk have used routine/hospitalisation data without detailed pre-morbid characterisation. Using the community-based UK Biobank cohort, we investigate risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in comparison with non-COVID-19 mortality. We investigated demographic, social (education, income, housing, employment), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, body mass index), biological (lipids, cystatin C, vitamin D), medical (comorbidities, medications) and environmental (air pollution) data from UK Biobank (N = 473,550) in relation to 459 COVID-19 and 2626 non-COVID-19 deaths to 21 September 2020. We used univariate, multivariable and penalised regression models. Age (OR = 2.76 [2.18-3.49] per S.D. [8.1 years], p = 2.6 x 10-17), male sex (OR = 1.47 [1.26-1.73], p = 1.3 x 10-6) and Black versus White ethnicity (OR = 1.21 [1.12-1.29], p = 3.0 x 10-7) were independently associated with and jointly explanatory of (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.79) increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. In multivariable regression, alongside demographic covariates, being a healthcare worker, current smoker, having cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and oral steroid use at enrolment were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Penalised regression models selected income, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cystatin C, and oral steroid use as jointly contributing to COVID-19 mortality risk; Black ethnicity, hypertension and oral steroid use contributed to COVID-19 but not non-COVID-19 mortality. Age, male sex and Black ethnicity, as well as comorbidities and oral steroid use at enrolment were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 death. Our results suggest that previously reported associations of COVID-19 mortality with body mass index, low vitamin D, air pollutants, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may be explained by the aforementioned factors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Efforts have been made to contain COVID-19. Human behavior, affected by knowledge and perceptions, may influence the course of disease., METHODOLOGY: A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 422 participants. It consisted of 28 questions in four sections; seven questions about sociodemographic characteristics of participants, 12 questions to estimate level of knowledge about COVID-19, six questions to evaluate attitudes toward disease, and three questions to assess practices to prevent disease transmission., RESULTS: Their overall understanding of COVID-19 was satisfactory. 69% of the participants had satisfactory levels of knowledge, and the main sources of information were social media platforms (79.70%) and television (70.90%). There was a significant difference in knowledge as a function of gender (p = 0.50), occupation (p = 0.012), and smoking (p = 0.041). The participants held optimistic attitudes and adopted appropriate protective measures. Most participants agreed that COVID-19 can cause death (64.7%), poses greater risks to elderly (93.4%) and those with chronic diseases (96.7%), it is mandatory to quarantine infected individuals (98.1%), preventive health measures are important (97.6%), and health authorities will succeed in controlling the pandemic (67.5%). There was a statistically significant association between satisfactory levels of knowledge and the practice of wearing masks and the adoption of protective measures (avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing)., CONCLUSIONS: Residents of Al-Jouf region in Saudi Arabia have satisfactory levels of knowledge, optimistic attitudes, and good practice during the rapid rise period of the pandemic. Awareness campaigns will improve any misbeliefs and risky behaviors. Copyright (c) 2021 Eman A El-Masry, Rehab A Mohamed, Rehab I Ali, Marwa F Al Mulhim, Ahmed E Taha.

AB  - To compare the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scores from frontal chest radiographs (CXRs) for predicting patient outcomes and the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65 +/- 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores. AI algorithm is as robust a predictor of adverse patient outcome (death or need for mechanical ventilation) as subjective RALE scores in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on lifestyle behaviors and mood changes in the Croatian general population., METHODS: During ten days of the COVID-19 lockdown in Croatia, 3027 respondents (70.3% female) from the general population completed an online, self-report questionnaire. Demographic data and data on lifestyle habits and mood changes before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were collected., RESULTS: A total of 95.64% of respondents reported to follow most or all restrictions, with female sex (P<0.001) and higher education level (P<0.001) being associated with higher restriction compliance. Women smoked an increased number of cigarettes (P<0.001). The proportion of respondents of both sexes who did not drink or drank 7 drinks per week or more increased (P<0.001). Women also reported lower frequency (P=0.001) and duration of physical exercise (P<0.001). In total, 30.7% of respondents gained weight, with female sex (OR, 2.726) and higher BMI (OR, 1.116; both P<0.001) being associated with an increased likelihood of gaining weight. Both men and women felt more frequently afraid (P<0.001), discouraged (P<0.001), and sad (P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Public health authorities should promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles in order to reduce long-term negative effects of the lockdown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The older population has been especially affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the incidence, severity, mortality rate, clinical features, and risk factors of symptoms of COVID-19 in home-dwelling older people, and its association with type of residence, cognitive deterioration, and neurodegenerative diseases., METHODS: Data about symptoms of COVID-19 were collected through a telephone survey in the cohort of 913 older volunteers of the Vallecas Project, aged 75-90 years, most of them (902) home-dwelling, in Madrid, Spain. The association of demographic and anthropometric measures, genetic polymorphisms, comorbidities, life habits, type of residence, and frailty surrogates were explored as potential risk factors for the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 in the older population., FINDINGS: Sixty-two cases reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19; 6 of them had died, 4 in their home and 2 in the nursing home. Moderate/severe cases were significantly older and more frequently males. The APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with the presence of symptoms of COVID-19. Higher systolic blood pressure, more intense smoking habit, more alcohol intake, lower consumption of coffee and tea, and cognitive impairment were associated with disease severity., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in this older cohort of Madrid was 6.8%, with an overall mortality rate of 0.7% (18.2% in those living in a nursing home) and a fatality rate of 9.9%. Our exploratory study indicates that life habits, other clinical conditions and, the epsilon4 variant of the APOE gene are associated with the presence and clinical severity of coronavirus infection.

AB  - Background: The recent emergence and rapid global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is leading to public health crises worldwide. Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking (CS) are two known risk factors in many diseases including respiratory infections., Methods: We performed a multi-center study in the four largest hospitals designated for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. There are totally 1547 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the study, alcohol consumption and CS history were evaluated among these patients. The epidemiology, laboratory findings and outcomes of patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied., Results: Our findings indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of CS tend to have more severe outcomes than non-smoking patients. However, alcohol consumption did not reveal significant effects on neither development of severe illness nor death rates in COVID-19 patients., Conclusion: CS is a risk factor for developing severe illness and increasing mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We believe that our findings will provide a better understanding on the effects of alcohol intake and CS exposure in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Changing health in China: re-evaluating the epidemiological transition model
AU  - Cook, Ian G

PY  - 2004
AB  - This paper reviews the changing health situation in China, which has shown remarkable improvement in the 50 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. At first sight this improving health situation follows the classical epidemiological transition model. Just three decades ago health in China was characterised by high rates of infectious disease and early mortality (diseases of poverty) in a mainly peasant society. More recently infectious disease rates have decreased, with corresponding and extended morbidity and mortality associated with an aging population in a rapidly urbanising society. This process has given rise to new health problems, including chronic and degenerative diseases (diseases of affluence). Nonetheless, while there is some validity in the application of the epidemiological transition concept, further analysis demonstrates that China faces a new epidemiological phase, characterised by increasing life expectancy and diseases of affluence coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that China's state policy plays a major role in defining the parameters of health in a Chinese context. We conclude that, today, China is faced with a new set of health issues, including the impact of smoking, hypertension, the health effects of environmental pollution and the rise of HIV/AIDS; however, state policy remains vital to the health of China's vast population. The challenge for policy is to maintain health reform whilst tackling the problems associated with rapid urbanisation, widening social and spatial inequalities and the emergence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.

AU  - Cohen, S
AU  - Tyrrell, D A

PY  - 1991
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses., METHODS: After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer., RESULTS: The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings., CONCLUSIONS: Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.

This induced the government to adopt severely restrictive measures to reduce the contagion risk, forcing most of the population to stop working and from leisure activities, and to remain at home for several weeks. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-related quarantine on smoking and dietary habits of a well-characterized northern Italian rural population. For this purpose, while lockdown restrictions were in place (February-April 2020), 359 subjects from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort underwent a phone interview about their lifestyle habit changes during COVID-19-related quarantine. Quarantine did not significantly modify smoking habit nor body mass index. Subjects significantly increased daily carbohydrates consumption, all fresh vegetables, healthy vegetable oils, milk and yogurt, alcoholic drinks, sugars and sweets, and coffee. The weekly consumption of low-fat meat, cured meat other than ham, cheeses, eggs, nuts and mixed seed oils significantly increased, while the weekly intake of fish, mussels, and legumes significantly decreased during lockdown. The Dietary Quality Index was reduced from 42.4 +/- 4.1 to 37.8 +/- 4.7 (p < 0.03). In accordance with our findings, COVID-19-related quarantine might worsen the quality of diet, also leading to an increased intake of almost all food categories.

AB  - We compared the rates of fever in adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory viruses and examined the factors that predict fever in adults. Symptom data on 158 healthcare workers (HCWs) with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection were collected using standardized data collection forms from three separate studies. Overall, the rate of fever in confirmed viral respiratory infections in adult HCWs was 23.4% (37/158). Rates varied by virus: human rhinovirus (25.3%, 19/75), influenza A virus (30%, 3/10), coronavirus (28.6%, 2/7), human metapneumovirus (28.6%, 2/7), respiratory syncytial virus (14.3%, 4/28) and parainfluenza virus (8.3%, 1/12). Smoking [relative risk (RR) 4.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-16.25] and co-infection with two or more viruses (RR 4.19, 95% CI 1.21-14.52) were significant predictors of fever. Fever is less common in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections, including influenza, than described in children. More than 75% of adults with a viral respiratory infection do not have fever, which is an important finding for clinical triage of adult patients with respiratory infections. The accepted definition of 'influenza-like illness' includes fever and may be insensitive for surveillance when high case-finding is required. A more sensitive case definition could be used to identify adult cases, particularly in event of an emerging viral infection.

AB  - E-cigarette use has been increasing among middle school students. Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.

AB  - The subpleural sparing pattern is a common finding on computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. It comprises of pulmonary opacities sparing the lung peripheries, typically 1cm and less from the pleural surface. This finding has a variety of causes, including idiopathic, inflammatory, infectious, inhalational, cardiac, traumatic, and bleeding disorders. Specific disorders that can cause subpleural sparing patterns include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), vaping-associated lung injury (VALI), cracked lung, pulmonary edema, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), pulmonary contusion, and more recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Knowledge of the many etiologies of this pattern can be useful in preventing diagnostic errors. In addition, although the etiology of subpleural sparing pattern is frequently indistinguishable during an initial radiologic evaluation, the differences in location of opacities in the lungs, as well as the presence of additional radiologic findings, patient history, and clinical presentation, can often be useful to suggest the appropriate diagnosis. We did a comprehensive search on Pubmed and Google Scholar database using keywords of "subpleural sparing," "peripheral sparing," "sparing of peripheries," "CT chest," "chest imaging," and "pulmonary disease." This review aims to describe the primary differential diagnosis of subpleural sparing pattern seen on chest imaging with a strong emphasis on clinical and radiographic findings. We also discuss the pathogenesis and essential clues that are crucial to narrow the differential diagnosis. Copyright 2021 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has progressed, there have been marked geographical differences in the pace and extent of its spread. We evaluated the association of BCG vaccination on morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV2, adjusted for country-specific responses to the epidemic, demographics and health. SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths as reported by 31 May 2020 in the World Health Organization situation reports were used. Countries with at least 28 days following the first 100 cases, and available information on BCG were included. We used log-linear regression models to explore associations of cases and deaths with the BCG vaccination policy in each country, adjusted for population size, gross domestic product, proportion aged over 65 years, stringency level measures, testing levels, smoking proportion, and the time difference from date of reporting the 100th case to 31 May 2020. We further looked at the association that might have been found if the analyses were done at earlier time points. The study included 97 countries with 73 having a policy of current BCG vaccination, 13 having previously had BCG vaccination, and 11 having never had BCG vaccination. In a log-linear regression model there was no effect of country-level BCG status on SARS-CoV2 cases or deaths. Univariable log-linear regression models showed a trend towards a weakening of the association over time. We found no statistical evidence for an association between BCG vaccination policy and either SARS-CoV2 morbidity or mortality. We urge countries to rather consider alternative tools with evidence supporting their effectiveness for controlling SARS-CoV2 morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the Black/African American communities in the U.S. The objective of this study is to understand the change in cigar smoking patterns and motivations to quit cigars during the COVID-19 pandemic among Black young adult cigar smokers., Methods: During May-June 2020, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted to investigate cigar (i.e., large cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, and blunts) smoking behaviors during the pandemic among self-identified, non-Hispanic Black/African American young adult cigar smokers (n = 40; ages 21-29). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded separately by three coders. Thematic analysis was used to assess thematic patterns arising from the interviews., Results: Most participants reported smoking cigarillos and blunts in higher frequency and quantity to cope with COVID-19-induced stress, anxiety, loneliness, and boredom due to economic losses and physical isolation. Some also reported contextual changes in cigarillo and blunt smoking, including smoking around the clock, smoking immediately after waking up, and smoking an entire cigarillo or blunt in one setting. Very few participants reported motivations to quit cigars during the pandemic. Perceiving higher risks of progressed COVID-19 outcomes did not prompt participants' increased motivations for quitting cigars., Conclusions: Black young adults in this study increasingly smoked cigarillos and blunts during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly attributed to daily life stressors. Participants did not have increased motivations for quitting cigars to reduce COVID-19-related risks. Promoting contextually appropriate healthy coping and cigar smoking cessation may minimize COVID-19-related health consequences of cigar smoking and reduce health disparities among Black young adults.

AU  - Chen, Bo
AU  - Jia, Puqi
AU  - Han, Jie
PY  - 2021
AB  - The relationship between outdoor atmospheric pollution by particulate matter and the morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections was recently disclosed, yet the role of indoor aerosols is poorly known . Since people spend most of their time indoor, indoor aerosols are closer to human occupants than outdoors, thus favoring airborne transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, here we review the characteristics of aerosol particles emitted from indoor sources, and how exposure to particles affects human respiratory infections and transport of airborne pathogens. We found that tobacco smoking, cooking, vacuum cleaning, laser printing, burning candles, mosquito coils and incenses generate large quantities of particles, mostly in the ultrafine range below 100 nm. These tiny particles stay airborne, are deposited in the deeper regions of human airways and are difficult to be removed by the respiratory system. As a consequence, adverse effects can be induced by inhaled aerosol particles via oxidative stress and inflammation. Early epidemiological evidence and animal studies have revealed the adverse effects of particle exposure in respiratory infections. In particular, inhaled particles can impair human respiratory systems and immune functions, and induce the upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus inducing higher vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, co-production of inflammation mediators by COVID-19 infection and particle exposure magnifies the cytokine storm and aggravates symptoms in patients. We also discuss the role of indoor aerosol particles as virus carriers. Although many hypotheses were proposed, there is still few knowledge on interactions between aerosol articles and virus-laden droplets or droplet nuclei.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence on perinatal mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its potential determinants is limited. Therefore, this multinational study aimed to assess the mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the pandemic, and to explore potential associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress and women's sociodemographic, health, and reproductive characteristics., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK between 16 June and 14 July 2020. Pregnant and breastfeeding women up to 3 months postpartum who were older than 18 years of age were eligible. The online, anonymous survey was promoted through social media and hospital websites. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess mental health status. Regression model analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor mental health status., RESULTS: In total, 9041 women participated (including 3907 pregnant and 5134 breastfeeding women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS >= 13) was 15% in the pregnancy cohort and and 13% the breastfeeding cohort. Moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD >= 10) were found among 11% and 10% of the pregnant and breastfeeding women. The mean (+/-SD) PSS scores for pregnant and breastfeeding women were 14.1 +/- 6.6 and 13.7 +/- 6.6, respectively. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking, having an unplanned pregnancy, professional status, and living in the UK or Ireland., CONCLUSIONS: This multinational study found high levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety among pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings underline the importance of monitoring perinatal mental health during pandemics and other societal crises to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.

AB  - In the first stages of the pandemic, the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were significantly higher in men than in women most likely as the effect of biological, hormonal, metabolic differences between the two sexes. However, gender-related differences in lifestyles and social roles can also greatly influence the course of disease. To fully understand the influence of gender in the COVID-19 outbreak, the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data must be enhanced to allow a better knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men and women, not only from a biomedical point of view, but also considering the risk factors associated with the different roles that they play in the society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the prevalence of smoking rates and comorbidities and evaluate the relationship between them and disease severity and mortality in inpatients with COVID-19., METHODS: COVID-19 patients were divided into the following groups: clinic group, intensive care unit (ICU) group, survivors, and non-survivors. Non-COVID-19 patients were included as a control group. The groups were compared., RESULTS: There was no difference between patients with and without COVID-19 in terms of smoking, asthma, diabetes, dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic renal failure and arrhythmia (p>0.05). Older age (Odds ratio (OR), 1.061; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.041-1.082; p< 0.0001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 2.775; 95% CI: 1.128-6.829; p=0.026) and CAD (OR, 2.696; 95% CI: 1.216-5.974; p=0.015) were significantly associated with ICU admission. Current smoking (OR, 5.101; 95% CI: 2.382-10.927; p<0.0001) and former smoking (OR, 3.789; 95% CI: 1.845-7.780; p<0.0001) were risk factors for ICU admission. Older age (OR; 1.082; 95% CI: 1.056-1.109; p<0.0001), COPD (OR, 3.213; 95% CI: 1.224-8.431; p=0.018), CAD (OR, 6.252; 95% CI: 2.171-18.004; p=0.001) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR, 5.917; 95% CI 1.069-32.258; p=0.042), were significantly associated with mortality. Current smoking (OR, 13.014; 95% CI: 5.058-33.480; p<0.0001) and former smoking (OR, 6.507; 95% CI 2.731-15.501; p<0.0001) were also risk factors for mortality., CONCLUSION: Smoking, older age, COPD, and CAD were risk factors for ICU admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19. CHF was not a risk factor for ICU admission; however, it was a risk factor for mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has spread worldwide. The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI >= 24and < 24., RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI >= 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI >= 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI >= 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI >= 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI < 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI >= 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course. Thus, high BMI is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 related high morbidity and mortality have led to a common fear and anxiety. This study aimed to determine the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and COVID-19 pneumonia. The study was conducted at the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Central Anatolia of Turkey. 120 patients with myocardial infarction , 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 120 healthy volunteers as a control group were included in the study. The participants filled out the questionnaire that included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Thorson-Powell's Revised Death Anxiety Scale (RDAS). All scores of patient groups were significantly higher than the control group. There was no significant difference in terms of STAI-S, STAI-T, and RDAS scores between COVID-19 pneumonia and MI groups. The anxiety risk increased 2.14-fold for STAI-T and 1.97-fold for STAI-S in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared to the control group. In this study, the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were as high as patients with myocardial infarction.COVID-19 pneumonia-related anxiety was associated with chronic diseases and smoking. Knowing the level of anxiety in these patients is important to provide better health services in the emergency departments.

AB  - Tobacco and cannabis use, alcohol consumption and inactivity are health risk behaviors (HRB) of crucial importance for health and wellbeing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students' engagement in HRB has yet received limited attention. We investigated whether HRB changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, assessed factors associated with change and profiles of HRB changes in university students. A web-based survey was conducted in May 2020, including 5021 students of four German universities (69% female, the mean age of 24.4 years (SD = 5.1)). Sixty-one percent of students reported consuming alcohol, 45.8% binge drinking, 44% inactivity, 19.4% smoking and 10.8% cannabis use. While smoking and cannabis use remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24.4% reported a decrease in binge drinking while 5.4% reported an increase. Changes to physical activity were most frequently reported, with 30.6% reporting an increase and 19.3% reporting a decrease in vigorous physical activity. Being female, younger age, being bored, not having a trusted person and depressive symptoms were factors associated with a change in HRB. Five substance use behavior profiles were identified, which also remained fairly unchanged. Efforts to promote student health and wellbeing continue to be required, also in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - The incidence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with critically ill non-COVID patients
AU  - Boyd, Sean
AU  - Martin-Loeches, Ignacio
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that is currently responsible for the global pandemic. It has been reported that up to 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop VTE (venous thromboembolism), and this can be as high as 31% in ICU patients with COVID-19 [2]., AIMS: To determine VTE rates in ICU patients with COVID compared to those admitted with influenza and a control group., METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients admitted to ICU at our hospital. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, coagulation profile and prevalence of radiologically proven VTE were recorded and compared between groups., RESULTS: More males than females were found in each group. When groups were compared the mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar, as was the incidence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. aPTT was higher in the COVID-19 (30.9 +/- 3.7 SD) vs (12.8 +/- 4.1 SD) the influenza group vs (15.2 +/- 4.1 SD) in controls p < 0.001, but fibrinogen was lower 6.2 +/- 1.6 SD vs 34.6 +/- 14.0SD vs 30.8 +/- 5.0 SD, respectively, p < 0.001. VTE rates in the COVID (13.2%) (DVT 5.3%, PE 10.5%) and influenza groups (15.8%) (DVT 13.2%, PE 2.6%) were similar but were higher than the control group (8.1%) (DVT 8.1%, PE 2.7%), but not significantly so (p = 0.5)., CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with COVID-19 displayed an abnormal coagulation profile and a VTE rate that is similar to ICU patients with influenza. VTE occurred despite thromboprophylaxis and remains a pertinent differential to keep in mind.

AB  - The pandemic caused by Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a great concern for public and mental health systems worldwide. The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England., METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >=18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time., RESULTS: 17 282 905 adults were included, of whom 27 480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14 882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2.90 (95% CI 1.96-4.30; p<0.0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.74-3.84; p<0.0001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 4.31 (95% CI 2.42-7.65) versus 1.84 (1.03-3.26) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0.044)., INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves., FUNDING: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

AB  - There has been a markedly renewed interest in factors associated with pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide, due to its frequent concurrence with pandemics of influenza and Covid-19 disease. Reported predisposing factors to both bacterial pneumonia and pandemic viral lower respiratory infections are wintertime occurrence, older age, obesity, pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes. Also implicated are age-related neurodegenerative diseases that cause parkinsonism and dementia. We investigated the prevalence of autopsy-proven pneumonia in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study, between the years 2006 and 2019 and before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of 691 subjects dying at advanced ages (mean 83.4), pneumonia was diagnosed postmortem in 343 (49.6%). There were 185 subjects without dementia or parkinsonism while clinicopathological diagnoses for the other subjects included 319 with Alzheimer's disease dementia, 127 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 49 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 78 with vascular dementia. Subjects with one or more of these neurodegenerative diseases all had higher pneumonia rates, ranging between 50 and 61%, as compared to those without dementia or parkinsonism (40%). In multivariable logistic regression models, male sex and a non-summer death both had independent contributions (ORs of 1.67 and 1.53) towards the presence of pneumonia at autopsy while the absence of parkinsonism or dementia was a significant negative predictor of pneumonia (OR 0.54). Male sex, dementia and parkinsonism may also be risk factors for Covid-19 pneumonia. The apolipoprotein E4 allele, as well as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly and cigarette smoking history, were not significantly associated with pneumonia, in contradistinction to what has been reported for Covid-19 disease.

AB  - Background: Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..

AB  - AIMS: To process data from the first wave of Covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) collected in the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) of the First Faculty of Medicine and Central Military Hospital, Prague. To analyse some clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Covid-19 in the context of the Czech Republic and to compare them with the data from the most recent literature., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data on patients admitted to the IDC between 12 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The study cohort included 53 patients with Covid-19, 25 females and 28 males, with an average age of 57 years. The parameters analysed were clinical symptoms, average length of hospital stay, complications, and death. Additional data concerned the age, weight, smoking habits, history of comorbidities, and selected laboratory results. These data were compared between groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19. Finally, imaging findings, serology results, and therapy outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaStat software., RESULTS: Eleven (20.8%) patients had a mild course of the disease, 16 (30.2%) patients had a moderate course, 22 (41.5%) patients had a severe course, and four (7.5%) patients had a critical course. The study patients presented with the following clinical symptoms: fever in 88.5% of cases, cough in 84.6% of cases, difficulty breathing in 77.4% of cases, diarrhoea in 23.1% of cases, chest pain in 17.3% of cases, and anosmia in 11.5% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was eight days. The most common complication was a bacterial superinfection, reported in 17 (32.1%) study patients. The overall case fatality rate for Covid-19 in our study was 5.7%. The average age of the study cohort was 57 years, and patients with a severe course of the disease were of older average age than those with a less severe course of the disease (p < 0.05). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The analysis of the baseline laboratory data showed significant differences between the groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19 in CRP, procalcitonin, and d-dimers but not in lymphocyte count. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs was performed in 22 patients, and 21 of them had typical findings for Covid-19. The average MuLBSTA score for Covid-19 pneumonia severity in our study cohort was 11.5 points and was not associated with the severity of the course of the disease. Serology tests were performed in 43 study patients, with 29 (67.4%) of them turning out positive in the first test and other five (11.6%) testing positive when retested. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was given experimentally as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin (AZI) to 24 (45.3%) patients. Two patients on HCQ therapy also received inosinum pranobexum (isoprinosine) for severe lymphopenia, one patient received convalescent plasma, six patients were given AZI alone, and one patient was treated with inosinum pranobexum alone. Altogether 37.7% of study patients were prescribed other antibiotics for confirmed or suspected bacterial superinfection. Standard clinical and pharmaceutical care was provided to patients with particular focus on the safety of off-label drug use. HCQ was with drawn in three patients due to a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc)., CONCLUSIONS: In the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our study patients showed comorbidities and risk factors which are consistent with the international literature, but the course of the disease was mostly moderate to severe, with a low proportion of critically ill patients and fatal outcomes. As soon as new information became available, new diagnostic and therapeutic options were introduced into routine practice. Based on our experience, we are well prepared for a possible second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the diagnostics, but the therapeutic options still remain very limited.

TI  - Self-isolation: A significant contributor to cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic
AU  - Bartel, S J

PY  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging research suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in self-reported isolation and loneliness in a large proportion of the population. This is particularly concerning given that isolation and loneliness are associated with increased cannabis use, as well as using cannabis to cope with negative affect. Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020. Pre-pandemic cannabis use levels had been collected four months earlier. Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.

TI  - Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an Asia-Pacific perspective
AU  - Asia Pacific COPD Roundtable Group
PY  - 2005
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem and its prevalence and mortality are increasing throughout the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. To arrest these worldwide trends, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Expert Panel's global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD was published in 2001. Based on recently published clinical trials, the GOLD statement was updated in 2003. The Asia-Pacific COPD Roundtable Group, a taskforce of expert respirologists from the Asia-Pacific region, has recently formulated a consensus statement on implementation of the GOLD strategy for COPD in the Asia-Pacific region. The key issues identified by the COPD Roundtable Group for comment are: (i) where there is no access to spirometry, diagnosis of COPD could be suspected on the basis of history, symptoms and physical signs; (ii) inhaled bronchodilators are the preferred regular treatment for COPD in the region, but oral bronchodilators may be considered if the cost of inhaled bronchodilators is a barrier to treatment; (iii) the use of a Metered Dose Inhaler with spacer in place of a nebulizer is recommended in the treatment of acute airflow obstruction in patients with COPD; (iv) influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with COPD in communities where there is a high likelihood of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; and (v) simplified pulmonary rehabilitation programmes should be established in areas where comprehensive programmes are unavailable. Physical exercise training and education on smoking cessation should be core elements of any rehabilitation program. In summary, the COPD Roundtable Group supports implementation of the GOLD strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of COPD in the Asia-Pacific region, subject to the additions and modifications to the guidelines suggested above.

AB  - Human rhinovirus (HRV) accounts for a significant portion of common-cold illness, with the peak incidence being in the early fall. Three hundred forty-six adults who had self-diagnosed colds of 48 h or less were enrolled in a study during September and October 1994 to determine the frequency and clinical course of HRV infections. Nasal wash specimens for viral culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for HRV RNA and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E RNA detection were collected on enrollment, and participants recorded their symptoms twice daily for 14 days. Middle ear pressure (MEP) was measured with a digital tympanometer on days 1 and 7. Picornaviruses (224 HRV and 7 enterovirus isolates) were detected by culture in 67% (231 of 346) of the subjects. Among 114 samples negative by culture, HRV was detected by RT-PCR in 52 (46%) for an overall picornavirus infection rate of 82% (283 of 346 subjects). Among the remaining 62 negative samples, human coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 5 patients, so that 288 (83%) of patients had documented viral infection. The first symptom noticed most often was sore throat (40%) in HRV culture- or PCR-positive patients and stuffy nose in HRV-negative patients (27%). No differences in symptom scores over time or in the presence of individual symptoms were noted between groups. The median duration of the cold episodes was 11 days in HRV culture-positive patients, 9.5 days in HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 11.5 days in HRV-negative patients. On enrollment, abnormal MEPs ( or = +100 mm of H2O) were found for 21% of HRV culture-positive patients, 14% of HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 10% of HRV-negative patients. No important differences in the clinical course of HRV culture-positive, HRV culture-negative and RT-PCR-positive, or HRV-negative colds were found. These results represent the highest frequency of virologically confirmed natural colds to date and document the importance of rhinoviruses as the cause of colds during fall months.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers., SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London., DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data., PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders., RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group., CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products >6 months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias. On examination, he was ill appearing and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity. As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment of this patient early in the era of coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social determinants and health inequalities have a huge impact on health of populations. It is important to study their role in the management of the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in cities, as certain variables like the number of tests and the access to health system cannot be assumed as equal. The aim of this work was to determine the relation of social determinants in the incidence of Covid-19 in the city of Barcelona., METHODS: An observational retrospective ecological study was performed, with the neighbourhood as the population unit, based on data of cumulative incidence published at May 14th, 2020 by the Public Health Agency of Barcelona. Covid-19 incidence disparities depending on the income of the neighbourhoods, the Pearson linear correlation of the variables selected (age, sex, net density, immigrants, comorbidities, smokers, Body Mass Index [BMI] and Available Income per Family Index [AIFI]) with the incidence and the correlation with a multivariant Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were estimated., RESULTS: It was found that neighbourhoods belonging to the lowest quintile of income had a 42% more incidence than those belonging to the highest quintile: 942 cases per 100,000 inhabitants versus 545 per 100,000 inhabitants of the highest quintile. The Pearson correlation was statistically significative between the incidence of Covid-19 and the percentage of population over 75 (r=0.487), the percentage of immigration of the neighbourhood and the origin of the immigrants (r=-0.257), the AIFI (r=-0.462), the percentage of smokers (r=0.243) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (r=0.483). The GLM showed that the most correlated variables with the incidence are the percentage of people over 75 (Z-score=0.258), the percentage of people from Maghreb (Z-score=-0.206) and Latin America (Z-score=0.19) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (Z-score=0.334). The results of the GLM were significative., CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants are correlated with the modification of the incidence of Covid-19 in the neighbourhoods of Barcelona, with special relevance of the prevalence of BMI over 25 and the percentage of immigrants and its origin.

AB  - Introduction: Substance use disorder has been frequently reported to increase the risk of infectious diseases, which might be owing to the sharing of contaminated inhalation, smoking, vaping, or injection equipment. Aim: This review analyzes the recent literature with the aim to put in light the possible relationship between the abuse of different substances (Tobacco, opioid, and Alcohol) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Tobacco: Multiple studies confirmed that cigarette smoking affects the respiratory system by increasing the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, which have a significant association with COVID-19 infection rate and disease severity. Opioid: Studies conducted regarding the association of opioid use disorder (OUD) and COVID-19 infection severity are limited; however, opioids can lead to both respiratory depression and kidney injuries, causing poor prognosis for those with COVID-19 infections. Alcohol: People with alcohol use disorders are at risk of developing acute lung injury and severe COVID-19 infection. Alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has two possible scenarios: either increased or decreased based on situations. Conclusion: SUD has been frequently reported to have a positive relationship with COVID-19 severity Further studies are needed to understand the effects of opioids and alcohol abuse on COVID-19.

TI  - The Structure and the Outcome of Telephone-Based Cardiac Consultations During Lockdown: A Lesson From COVID-19
AU  - Alhadramy, Osama M Sr
PY  - 2020
AB  - Background In response to COVID-19, Saudi Arabia as many countries, implemented "lockdown" to contain the epidemic. This resulted in suspension of all outpatient services. The reliability of the alternative telecommunication cardiac services during that time is not well studied. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to describe the structure of the telephone-based cardiac consultation (TBCC) and to explore its outcome. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that has a prospective follow up on patients who underwent medical intervention. During the period of lockdown, Alre'aiah health care society in Almadinah Almunawwarah, Saudi Arabia, provided a community health service. This was achieved by announcing telephone numbers for consultations in most specialties. This study includes all TBCC of a single cardiologist. Detailed demographic data, medical, social and drug histories of the patients were collected in charts. Individuals were requested to measure blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at the time of TBCC. Accordingly, cardiovascular assessment and appropriate intervention were executed. Patients who needed medical intervention were followed up in one week. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results From 01 April till 15 June 2020, a total of 168 individuals sought TBCC. Their median age was 51.5 +/- 12.7 years, and (57.1%) were females. Healthy individuals constituted (33.9%), and (59.9%) were non-smokers. The most common reported medical illnesses were hypertension (27.3%), diabetes (23.8%), heart failure (16.1%), and coronary artery disease (14.9%). Palpitations were encountered by 58 patients. None of them had high-risk features or cardiac disease. Stress, excessive smoking, and caffeine intake were thought to be responsible for palpitations in 52 individuals who were reassured and educated, and newly diagnosed hypertension was established prospectively in eight patients and they were started on medications. Chest pain was reported by 51 individuals. The diagnosis of typical angina was made in nine patients and they were instructed to seek emergency care. Atypical angina pain was established in 10 cases who were advised to seek formal consultation once lockdown ends. Reassurance was achieved in 32 individuals who had features of non-angina pain. Uncontrolled hypertension was reported by 32 patients. Blood pressure control was achieved prospectively in 70% of these patients who followed up by adjusting their antihypertensive drugs. Twenty-seven patients with heart failure complained of worsening shortness of breath. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 1-2 was reported by 21 patients, and they were managed by doubling diuretic dose, 19 of them followed back and reported significant improvement. NYHA class 3-4 was established in 6 patients and they were instructed to seek emergency care. Conclusions When standard face-to-face cardiac consultations are compromised, a structured TBCC is considered feasible, seems effective, and promising alternative method of delivering the utmost cardiac care to the community. When conducted properly, it is useful to triage patients. Copyright 2020, Alhadramy et al.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced as a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several scientists have focused on the low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings led to our hypothesis that the Nicotinic Cholinergic System (NCS) plays a crucial role in the manifestation of COVID-19 and its severe symptoms. Molecular modeling revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein might bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) through a cryptic epitope homologous to snake toxins, substrates well documented and known for their affinity to the nAChRs. This binding model could provide logical explanations for the acute inflammatory disorder in patients with COVID-19, which may be linked to severe dysregulation of NCS. In this study, we present a series of complexes with cholinergic agonists that can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein from binding to nAChRs, avoiding dysregulation of the NCS and moderating the symptoms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. If our hypothesis is verified by in vitro and in vivo studies, repurposing agents currently approved for smoking cessation and neurological conditions could provide the scientific community with a therapeutic option in severe COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), global health problem and it is a threat to health and the development of countries. Currently, the number of people with COVID-19 as well as the resulting death toll is rising sharply worldwide. People with underlying diseases may be at greater risk., AIM: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the chronic non-communicable diseases in the epidemic (COVID-19): Investigation of risk factors, control and care., METERIALS AND METHODS: To access the articles, including international databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase were searched using the keywords of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), chronic, risk factors, prevention and control, self-efficacy and self-care and their various combinations using AND/OR operators. No language restrictions were applied to the search process., RESULTS: Based on the evidence, NCDs, exacerbate the negative consequences of COVID-19. according to the results of this study, Among the patients admitted with COVID-19, The most common underlying diseases, were in these people, include, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Obesity may be considered as a potential COVID-19 risk factor., CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle, nutrition, and medical interventions are important for the early prevention of NCDs, having the tools and resources to use information more effectively is more important One of the determining and effective factors in maintaining health and preventing the aggravation of signs and symptoms of the disease COVID-19, especially in chronic diseases, is to perform self-care behaviors.

AB  - The severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a huge social and health challenge worldwide. Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, older age, and other co-infections. Other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking are common comorbidities worldwide. Previous investigations have identified among COVID-19 patients smokers and COPD patients, but recent investigations have questioned the higher risk among these populations. Nevertheless, previous reports failed to isolate smokers and COPD patients without other comorbidities. We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID-19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge. Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID-19-associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to non-smokers and former smokers. Our results demonstrated that smoking and COPD are risk factors for severe COVID-19 with possible implications for the ongoing pandemic.

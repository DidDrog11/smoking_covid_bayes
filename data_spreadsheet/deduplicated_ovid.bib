AB  - Background: The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and ischemic stroke is poorly defined. We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations., Methods: Genetic association estimates for liability to Covid-19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained from large-scale consortia. Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid-19, defined as hospitalization with Covid-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical Covid-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was identified., Results: There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke (r g =0.29, FDR p -value=4.65x10 -3 ), body mass index (r g =0.21, FDR- p -value = 6.26x10 -6 ) and C-reactive protein (r g =0.20, FDR- p -value=1.35x10 -4 ), but none of the other considered traits. In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical Covid-19 liability 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.06, p -value=0.03). Similar estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical Covid-19., Conclusions: These data support that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The host response predisposing to severe Covid-19 is likely to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors.

AB  - Background: Home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak may affect lifestyle behaviours, such as daily physical activity, social relationships, eating behaviours, and sleep, among others, which in turn may compromise mental health and psychological states. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-induced home confinement on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours and the correlations between them. Methods: Participants included 144 students (aged 18-22 years, 62.5% female, 89.5% single). Stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), d2 test, and the Simple Lifestyle Indicator Questionnaire adapted and modified (SLIQ), respectively. Total PSS score, concentration performance (CP), errors (E), and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise/activity, alcohol, and smoking) before and during confinement were calculated. Results: The data showed a significant difference between before and during confinement in total PSS, CP, E, and all lifestyle behaviours (all, p < 0.05). Significant correlations existed between total PSS score, CP, E, and lifestyle behaviours (r= -87-98, all, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Home confinement has a negative effect on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours. This study suggests that the adoption of proper lifestyle behaviours, particularly diet, disciplined hygiene, and physical activity, boost health, psychological states, and cognitive function during COVID-19-induced confinement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Studies in clinical settings showed a potential relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle factors with COVID-19, but it is still unknown whether this holds in the general population. In this study, we investigated the associations of SES with self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status in the general population., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were 49 474 men and women (46+/-12 years) residing in the Northern Netherlands from the Lifelines cohort study. SES indicators and lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, diet quality, sleep time and TV watching time) were assessed by questionnaire from the Lifelines Biobank. Self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status was obtained from the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire., RESULTS: There were 4711 participants who self-reported having had a COVID-19 infection, 2883 participants tested for COVID-19, and 123 positive cases were diagnosed in this study population. After adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, body mass index and ethnicity, we found that participants with low education or low income were less likely to self-report a COVID-19 infection (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.78 [0.71 to 0.86]; low income 0.86 [0.79 to 0.93]) and be tested for COVID-19 (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.58 [0.52 to 0.66]; low income 0.86 [0.78 to 0.95]) compared with high education or high income groups, respectively., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the low SES group was the most vulnerable population to self-reported and tested COVID-19 status in the general population.

AB  - ABSTRACT: As an international tourist center, Hainan province includes both imported and local COVID-19 cases. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hainan, China.COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Hainan affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University in January to March 2020 were retrospectively assessed. Routine blood tests, blood gas analyses, and computed tomography imaging were performed within 24 hours. Virus nucleic acid was detected every other day. The patients were divided into local resident and traveler groups, and differences in clinical data as well as leukocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil levels were analyzed.A total of 70 patients aged 51.23 +/- 13.54 years were assessed, including 16 local residents and 54 travelers. Of these, 55 cases (78.6%) had fever, 47 (67.1%) had cough and sputum, and 9 (12.9%) had chest dyspnea; 60 and 10 cases were mild/common and severe/critical, respectively. Sex, basic diseases, smoking history and drinking history, Charlson Comorbidity Index, symptoms, time of onset to admission, clinical severity, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, oxygen inhalation, mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoid therapy, treatment, admission to ICU, hospital stay, and mortality were similar between the 2 groups. The warm and humid climate of Hainan does not seem to significantly affect patient features and outcomes from COVID-19. Unnecessary travel to tourist areas should be avoided.

AB  - People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension have a high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and of COVID-19 mortality. However, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases cardiopulmonary damage, and vulnerability to COVID-19 has not yet been fully established. We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%-52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%-42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%-20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-mug/m3 increase in long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. However, when stratifying the data according to population size, the association became non-significant. The present results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings suggested that air pollution may be related to population vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, although the extent to which this relationship is confounded by city population density needs further exploration.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing mental health burden. We examined the factors associated with mental health symptoms in Chinese general adults in Hong Kong. Methods: We conducted a dual-frame (landline and mobile) survey on Chinese adults aged 18 years or older in April 2020. Shortage of preventive materials, perceptions of the outbreak (each item range 1-5), and reduction in income were assessed. Mental health symptoms measured included stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4, range 0-16), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorders-2, range 0-6, cutoff >2), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, range 0-6, cutoff >2). Results were weighted by the general population distribution. Associations were analyzed by multivariable linear (for stress) and logistic (for anxiety and depressive symptoms) regression adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related covariates, including confirmed or in close contacts of confirmed cases, chronic disease, self-rated health, and smoking and alcohol drinking behavior. Results: Of the 1,501 participants (52.5% female, 55.0 aged 30-59 years), the average stress score was 7.20 (SD 2.12). 218 (15.8%) and 206 (14.8%) participants had anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Shortage in facemasks (20.8%), alcohol-based hand sanitizers (13.9%), and cleaning products (7.3%) was reported. Participants generally disagree with the perception of at risk of getting infected in the coming 6 months (mean 2.2, SD 1.1), but tended to agree with the perception of worry that the people around pose a threat to them (mean 3.6, SD 0.9) and the outbreak has greatly affected their daily life (mean 3.7, SD 0.9). 59.3% employed participants had income reduction and 6.2% had become unemployed since the outbreak. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were more prevalent in those with shortages of preventive materials and negative perceptions of the outbreak (all P < 0.05). Reduction in income and unemployment were associated with more mental health symptoms (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Shortage of preventive materials, negative perceptions, financial loss, and unemployment were prevalent during the outbreak and found in association with higher stress and more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further research and urgent actions are warranted to relieve stress and promote mental health, targeting the many risk factors identified by our study.

AB  - This study examined individual-level determinants of self-reported changes in healthy (diet and physical activity) and addictive (alcohol use, smoking, and vaping) lifestyle behaviors during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in the USA. A national online survey was administered between May and June 2020 that targeted a representative U.S. sample and yielded data from 1276 respondents, including 58% male and 50% racial/ethnic minorities. We used univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine the associations of sociodemographic, mental health, and behavioral determinants with self-reported changes in lifestyle behaviors. Some study participants reported increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors since the pandemic (i.e., 36% increased healthy eating behaviors, and 33% increased physical activity). However, they also reported increases in addictive lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use (40%), tobacco use (41%), and vaping (46%). With regard to individual-level determinants, individuals who reported adhering to social distancing guidelines were also more likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors (beta = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21). Conversely, women (beta = -0.37, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.12), and unemployed individuals (beta = -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02) were less likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, individuals reporting anxiety were more likely to report increases in addictive behaviors (beta = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43). Taken together, these findings suggest that women and unemployed individuals may benefit from interventions targeting diet and physical activity, and that individuals reporting anxiety may benefit from interventions targeting smoking and alcohol cessation to address lifestyle changes during the pandemic.

AB  - The global surge in COVID-19 cases underscores the need for fast, scalable, and reliable testing. Current COVID-19 diagnostic tests are limited by turnaround time, limited availability, or occasional false findings. Here, we developed a machine learning-based framework for predicting individual COVID-19 positive diagnosis relying only on readily-available baseline data, including patient demographics, comorbidities, and common lab values. Leveraging a cohort of 31,739 adults within an academic health system, we trained and tested multiple types of machine learning models, achieving an area under the curve of 0.75. Feature importance analyses highlighted serum calcium levels, temperature, age, lymphocyte count, smoking, hemoglobin levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and oxygen saturation as key predictors. Additionally, we developed a single decision tree model that provided an operable method for stratifying sub-populations. Overall, this study provides a proof-of-concept that COVID-19 diagnosis prediction models can be developed using only baseline data. The resulting prediction can complement existing tests to enhance screening and pandemic containment workflows.

AB  - Introduction: The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now rapidly spread around the world. This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia., Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data., Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age (P=0.004), hypertension (P=0.007), diabetes (P=0.029), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.001) were covariates that affect the association., Conclusions: Smoking was associated with severe or critical outcomes and increased the risk of admission to ICU and mortality in COVID-19 patients, but not associated with mechanical ventilation. This association was more significant for former smokers than in current smokers. Current smokers also had a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared with non-smokers. More detailed data, which are representative of more countries, are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smokers are at more risk to COVID-19 as the entertainment of smoking because their fingers are in touch with lips regularly during smoking that increases the probability of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. On other hand the smokers may have lung disease (or reduced lung capacity) which would greatly increase risk of serious illness especially COVID-19. For this esteem, in this research work, we first formulate a mathematical model contains the reversion class. Then, using different techniques for finding the local and global stability of the presented model related to equilibrium points that are free smoking and positive smoking equilibrium points. As the model consisting on the nonlinear equations, so we use the non-standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme, ODE45 and RK4 methods to find the numerical results. Finally, we show the graphs numerically through MATLAB. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Investigating the spatial distribution patterns of disease and suspected determinants could help one to understand health risks. This study investigated the potential risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in the continental United States. We collected death cases of COVID-19 from 3108 counties from 23 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. Twelve variables, including demographic (the population density, percentage of 65 years and over, percentage of non-Hispanic White, percentage of Hispanic, percentage of non-Hispanic Black, and percentage of Asian individuals), air toxins (PM2.5), climate (precipitation, humidity, temperature), behavior and comorbidity (smoking rate, cardiovascular death rate) were gathered and considered as potential risk factors. Based on four geographical detectors (risk detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) provided by the novel Geographical Detector technique, we assessed the spatial risk patterns of COVID-19 mortality and identified the effects of these factors. This study found that population density and percentage of non-Hispanic Black individuals were the two most important factors responsible for the COVID-19 mortality rate. Additionally, the interactive effects between any pairs of factors were even more significant than their individual effects. Most existing research examined the roles of risk factors independently, as traditional models are usually unable to account for the interaction effects between different factors. Based on the Geographical Detector technique, this study's findings showed that causes of COVID-19 mortality were complex. The joint influence of two factors was more substantial than the effects of two separate factors. As the COVID-19 epidemic status is still severe, the results of this study are supposed to be beneficial for providing instructions and recommendations for the government on epidemic risk responses to COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a massive impact on public health, resulting in sudden dietary and behavioral habit changes. Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers., RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341-3.405) and the 11-20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359-3.143)., CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits. Dietary and behavioral intervention policies should be drafted to protect their health, especially frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor habits at baseline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people across the globe. It is associated with a high mortality rate and has created a global crisis by straining medical resources worldwide., OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate machine-learning models for prediction of mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients presenting to emergency room and for prediction of in-hospital mortality once a patient is admitted., METHODS: Two cohorts were used for the two different aims. 1980 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for the aim of prediction ofMV. 1036 patients' data, including demographics, past smoking and drinking history, past medical history and vital signs at emergency room (ER), laboratory values, and treatments were collected for training and 674 patients were enrolled for validation using XGBoost algorithm. For the second aim to predict in-hospital mortality, 3491 hospitalized patients via ER were enrolled. CatBoost, a new gradient-boosting algorithm was applied for training and validation of the cohort., RESULTS: Older age, higher temperature, increased respiratory rate (RR) and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) from the first set of vital signs were associated with an increased risk of MV amongst the 1980 patients in the ER. The model had a high accuracy of 86.2% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.8%. While, patients who required MV, had a higher RR, Body mass index (BMI) and longer length of stay in the hospital were the major features associated with in-hospital mortality. The second model had a high accuracy of 80% with NPV of 81.6%., CONCLUSION: Machine learning models using XGBoost and catBoost algorithms can predict need for mechanical ventilation and mortality with a very high accuracy in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the long-term (?4 weeks) use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is a risk factor for intubation requirement and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19., METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, a total of 382 adult patients (?18 years of age) with confirmed COVID?19 who were hospitalized for treatment were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to the periods during which they used PPIs: the first group included patients who were not on PPI treatment, and the second group included those who have used PPIs for more than 4 weeks., RESULTS: The study participants were grouped according to their PPI usage history over the last 6 months. In total, 291 patients did not use any type of PPI over the last 6 months, and 91 patients used PPIs for more than 4 weeks. Older age (HR: 1.047, 95% CI: 1.026?1.068), current smoking (HR: 2.590, 95% CI: 1.334?5.025), and PPI therapy for more than 4 weeks (HR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.06?2.41) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality., DISCUSSION: The results obtained in this study show that using PPIs for more than 4 weeks is associated with negative outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Patients receiving PPI therapy should be evaluated more carefully if they are hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Importance: Socioeconomic factors in the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have been reported in studies from the US and other Western countries. However, no studies have documented national- or subnational-level outcome disparities in Asian countries., Objective: To assess the association between regional COVID-19 outcome disparities and socioeconomic characteristics in Japan., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study collected and analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths (through February 13, 2021) as well as population and socioeconomic data in all 47 prefectures in Japan. The data sources were government surveys for which prefecture-level data were available., Exposures: Prefectural socioeconomic characteristics included mean annual household income, Gini coefficient, proportion of the population receiving public assistance, educational attainment, unemployment rate, employment in industries with frequent close contacts with the public, household crowding, smoking rate, and obesity rate., Main Outcomes and Measures: Rate ratios (RRs) of COVID-19 incidence and mortality by prefecture-level socioeconomic characteristics., Results: All 47 prefectures in Japan (with a total population of 126.2 million) were included in this analysis. A total of 412126 confirmed COVID-19 cases (326.7 per 100000 people) and 6910 deaths (5.5 per 100000 people) were reported as of February 13, 2021. Elevated adjusted incidence and mortality RRs of COVID-19 were observed in prefectures with the lowest household income (incidence RR: 1.45 [95% CI, 1.43-1.48] and mortality RR: 1.81 [95% CI, 1.59-2.07]); highest proportion of the population receiving public assistance (1.55 [95% CI, 1.52-1.58] and 1.51 [95% CI, 1.35-1.69]); highest unemployment rate (1.56 [95% CI, 1.53-1.59] and 1.85 [95% CI, 1.65-2.09]); highest percentage of workers in retail industry (1.36 [95% CI, 1.34-1.38] and 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.61]), transportation and postal industries (1.61 [95% CI, 1.57-1.64] and 2.55 [95% CI, 2.21-2.94]), and restaurant industry (2.61 [95% CI, 2.54-2.68] and 4.17 [95% CI, 3.48-5.03]); most household crowding (1.35 [95% CI, 1.31-1.38] and 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]); highest smoking rate (1.63 [95% CI, 1.60-1.66] and 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78]); and highest obesity rate (0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95] and 1.17 [95% CI, 1.01-1.34]) compared with prefectures with the most social advantages. Among potential mediating variables, higher smoking rate (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.33-1.78) and obesity rate (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34) were associated with higher mortality RRs, even after adjusting for prefecture-level covariates and other socioeconomic variables., Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a pattern of socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Japan that was similar to that observed in the US and Europe. National policy in Japan could consider prioritizing populations in socially disadvantaged regions in the COVID-19 response, such as vaccination planning, to address this pattern.

AB  - COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, with over 81 million cases worldwide. To assess changes in tobacco use as a result of the pandemic, we surveyed a convenience sample of current tobacco users between April and June 2020. The sample was taken from a tobacco user research registry (n = 3396) from the Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA. Participants who responded to the survey and were eligible for this study (n = 291) were 25.6% male, 93% white, and had a mean age of 47.3 (SD = 11.6) years. There were no reports of participants testing positive for COVID-19, but 21.7% reported experiencing symptoms associated with the virus. Most participants (67%) believed that their risk of contracting COVID-19 was the same as non-tobacco users, but 57.7% believed that their risk of serious complications, if infected, was greater compared to non-tobacco users. A total of 28% reported increasing their cigarette use during the pandemic. The most common reasons for increased use were increased stress, more time at home, and boredom while quarantined. Nearly 15% reported decreasing their tobacco use. The most common reasons for reduced use were health concerns and more time around non-smokers (including children). A total of 71 (24.5%) users reported making a quit attempt. Characterizing these pandemic-related changes in tobacco use may be important to understanding the full scope of subsequent health outcomes resulting from the pandemic. Tobacco cessation resources should be tailored to allow for safe, appropriate access for those interested in quitting.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) features associated with clinical parameters for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the capital of Turkey, Ankara., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings and radiological characteristics of 1563 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Ankara were collected, reviewed and analysed in this study. The risk factors associated with disease severity were investigated., RESULTS: Non-severe (1214; 77.7%) and severe cases (349; 22.3%) were enrolled in the study. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group were significantly older and had more comorbidities (ie, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Smoking was more common in the severe group. Severe patients had higher respiratory rates and higher incidences of cough and dyspnoea compared with non-severe patients. Compared with the non-severe patients, the severe patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CRP/albumin ratio and decreased albumin. The occurrence rates of consolidation, subpleural sparing, crazy-paving pattern, cavity, halo sign, reversed halo sign, air bronchogram, pleural thickening, micronodule, subpleural curvilinear line and multilobar and bilateral involvement in the CT finding of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients., CONCLUSIONS: Many factors are related to the severity of COVID-19, which can help clinicians judge the severity of the patient and evaluate the prognosis. This cohort study revealed that male sex, age (>=55 years), patients with any comorbidities, especially those with cardiovascular disease, dyspnoea, increased CRP, D-dimer and NLR, and decreased lymphocyte count and CT findings of consolidation and multilobar involvement were predictors of severe COVID-19.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess anxiety among a sample of dentistry students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 355 dentistry students (165 males and 190 females) completed the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-I (STAI-I), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory II (STAI-II) questionnaires. and evaluations of HAI, BAI, STAI-I, and STAI-II were based on sex, dental school year, smoking habit, and lifestyle. Female students had higher HAI and BAI scores than male students (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Statistically significant differences in HAI scores existed between preclinical and clinical students (p = 0.048). The only statistical significant differences detected in STAI-I scores involved students with an extended family when compared to students without an extended family (p = 0.039). The HAI scores of students who had close contact were significantly higher than students who had no contact (p = 0.047). There were significant correlations between the four scales (p < 0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic [was under control in Turkey?], the HAI scores were higher in female, clinical students and students who lived with an extended family.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of booster vaccination of adults with measles-mumps-rubella in the COVID-19 infection rates., Methods: In order to investigate this hypothesis, we tested COVID-19 positivity rate through PCR assay on the participants (n=245; male), who had to share the same student accommodation together with the same dining hall to provide governmental service. Participants were divided into two groups based on their booster vaccination status with measles-mumps-rubella: the non-vaccinated group (n=207) and the vaccinated group (n=38). The rate of COVID-19 seropositivity, age, body mass index (BMI), active smoking and presence of comorbidity were also measured and recorded., Results: All of the participants were healthy, and age distribution, comorbidity rates, active smoking status and BMI did not vary significantly among the two groups (p=0.305, p=0.594, p=0.280, and p=0.922, respectively). About 36.7% (n=90) of the participants were found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR among which the non-vaccinated cases had higher rates of COVID-19 seropositivity than the vaccinated cases (40.6% vs 15.8%) (OR=3.6, 95%CI: 1.5-9.0, p=0.004)., Conclusion: Based on these results, we cautiously predict that immunity produced by MMR vaccination boosters may provide some degree of protection against COVID-19 in the adult population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The perceived health risks of tobacco products may change during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the perceived risks of tobacco use on COVID-19 infection and severity, and possible COVID-related changes in perceptions of tobacco use and overall health., METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults in the United States in June 2020 (n=2097). The survey covered cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and hookah. We also assessed changes in the use of any of the four tobacco products. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of agreeing with the perceived risks for each risk and each product, with the adjustment of demographic and COVID-19 related variables., RESULTS: For all four tobacco products, the perceived risks to general health were slightly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic (77% vs 79.5% for cigarettes) and the perceived risk of COVID-19 severity was larger than the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (73.3% vs 56.2% for cigarettes). All risk measures varied with tobacco products consistently, with the risks highest for cigarettes, then cigars, followed by e-cigarettes and hookah. Females and people with higher income or education were more likely to endorse the risks of tobacco use than their counterparts. People who perceived higher risks of using cigarettes (OR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.20-2.27) and cigars (OR=1.63; 95% CI: 1.17-2.27) to COVID-19 severity were more likely to have decreased or quit their use., CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco/nicotine use was perceived to increase the risk of COVID-19 severity and the perceived risk of tobacco/nicotine use to general health was high during the pandemic, particularly for cigarettes. The change of perceived risks appeared to be prompting harm-reducing changes in tobacco product use. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Yang Y. et al.

AB  - Background: Workplace violence is a major concern for clinicians worldwide. There has been little data on the epidemiology of workplace violence against frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the pattern of workplace violence and its association with quality of life (QOL) against frontline clinicians during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted in China between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Frontline clinicians' experience with workplace violence was measured with six standardized questions derived from the Workplace Violence Scale, while anxiety, depressive, and insomnia symptoms, and QOL were measured using the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted. Results: A total of 15,531 clinicians completed the assessment; 2,878 (18.5, 95% CI = 17.92-19.14%) reported workplace violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (verbal violence: 16.1%; physical violence: 6.9%). According to multivariable models, key correlates of workplace violence were male gender, longer work experience, higher education level, smoking, working in the psychiatry or emergency department, working in tertiary hospitals, being involved in direct care of infected patients, having infected family/ friends/ colleagues, and frequently using social communication programs. Clinicians working in inpatient departments were less likely to report workplace violence compared to those working in outpatient departments. SEM analysis revealed that both violence and emotional disturbances (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) directly affected QOL (standardized direct effect = -0.031, and -0.566, respectively, P < 0.05), while emotional disturbances partly mediated the association between work violence and QOL (standardized indirect effect = -0.184, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Frontline clinicians were vulnerable to workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the negative impact of workplace violence on quality of care and clinicians' QOL, health authorities and policymakers should take effective measures to reduce workplace violence against clinicians.

TI  - How the COVID-19 pandemic impacts tobacco addiction: Changes in smoking behavior and associations with well-being
AU  - Yang, Haiyang

PY  - 2021
AB  - This research investigated (1) how the coronavirus pandemic impacted tobacco addiction, (2) which smoker segments were more vulnerable, and (3) how the changes in tobacco consumption were associated with smokers' satisfaction with physical health and psychological well-being. Data from a large-scale cross-sectional study of adults in China were analyzed. Outcome measures were the quantity of cigarettes consumed per day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quantity after the nationwide outbreak had been contained, satisfaction with physical health, and emotional well-being. Analyses revealed that, after the nationwide outbreak, more individuals quit (vs. started) smoking. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 consumption levels, smokers significantly reduced the quantity of cigarettes they consumed after the nationwide outbreak had been contained. However, there were substantial disparities across individuals: male (vs. female) smokers were less able to curb their smoking; smokers residing in urban (vs. rural) areas or with a longer smoking history were also less able to reduce their smoking. Importantly, a greater reduction in smoking was associated with higher satisfaction with physical health and better emotional well-being. Furthermore, a follow-up investigation revealed that concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to smoking were a primary factor driving smokers' behavior change. Overall, these results suggest that, to help smokers fight tobacco addiction and improve well-being, pandemic health policies need to take account of the differences in vulnerability across individuals and leverage the psychological factors that can facilitate behavior change.

AB  - Background and objectives: The whole world is spending an extraordinary effort by implementing various measures to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of the preventive measures is greatly influenced by the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards the disease. In this study, KAP values and some characteristic features of people recovered from COVID-19 were determined by conducting a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire survey was conducted between 1 and 10 January 2021 on people who recovered from COVID-19 in a total of 150 different locations in Turkey. The questionnaire consisted of 46 questions: 14 for determining demographic and some characteristic features of the participants, and 32 for determining their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The data obtained were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: It was determined that 63% of the participants had at least one chronic illness, 3.9% suffered from the disease twice, and 45.2% changed their smoking habits. The average knowledge score of the participants about COVID-19 was calculated as 10.25 (SD = 2.37; range 0-15). The participants were found to have a high level of knowledge about the symptoms and prevention methods in general, and positive changes in post-illness attitudes and behaviors. However, there was a great instability regarding the drugs and vaccines used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusions: This was the first study carried out in Turkey to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and some characteristic features of people who recovered from COVID-19. It was suggested that health authorities in the country need to develop more effective strategies and policies to find out permanent solutions in order to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic by taking into account the concerns of the public, particularly with regards to the drugs used in the treatment and vaccination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the current, world-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor for cellular inoculation and target organ injury. We reviewed ACE2 expression and the role of ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas receptor axis activity in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis to identify potential COVID-19 influences on AAA disease pathogenesis., METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, National Library of Medicine. Key words included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, AAA, ACE2, ACE or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibitor, angiotensin 1-7, Mas receptor, age, gender, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Key publications on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AAAs were identified and reviewed., RESULTS: All vascular structural cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes express ACE2. Cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lupus, certain types of malignancies, and viral infection promote ACE2 expression and activity, with the magnitude of response varying by sex and age. Genetic deficiency of AT1 receptor, or pharmacologic ACE or AT1 inhibition also increases ACE2 and its catalytic product angiotensin 1-7. Genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of ACE2 or Mas receptor augments, whereas ACE2 activation or angiotensin 1-7 treatment attenuates, progression of experimental AAAs. The potential influences of SARS-CoV-2 on AAA pathogenesis include augmented ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor activity resulting from decreased reciprocal ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas activation; increased production of proaneurysmal mediators stimulated by viral spike proteins in ACE2-negative myeloid cells or by ACE2-expressing vascular structural cells; augmented local or systemic cross-talk between viral targeted nonvascular, nonleukocytic ACE2-expressing cells via ligand recognition of their cognate leukocyte receptors; and hypoxemia and increased systemic inflammatory tone experienced during severe COVID-19 illness., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may theoretically influence AAA disease through multiple SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanisms. Further investigation and clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will influence the prevalence, progression, and lethality of AAA disease in the coming decade.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although relevant studies show that the smoking rate of COVID-19 patients is relatively low, the current smoking status of people with COVID-19 cannot be accurately measured for reasons. Thus, it is difficult to assess the relationship between smoking and COVID-19. Smoking can increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and aggravate the condition of patients with COVID-19. Nicotine upregulates the expression of ACE2, which can also increase susceptibility to COVID-19, aggravatiing the disease. Although nicotine has certain anti-inflammatory effects, there is no evidence that it is related to COVID-19 treatment; therefore, smoking cannot be considered a preventative measure. Furthermore, smokers gathering and sharing tobacco may promote the spread of viruses. Despite the COVID-19 epidemic, the findings suggested that COVID-19 has not encouraged smokers to quit. Additionally, there is evidence that isolation at home has contributed to increased smoking behavior and increased quantities. Therefore, it is recommended that governments increase smoking cessation messaging as part of public health measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. This review analyzes the existing research on smoking's impact on COVID-19 so that governments and medical institutions can develop evidence-based smoking-related prevention and control measures for COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalisation have yet to be clearly defined. We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors., METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC)., FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8.61 [95% CI 2.83-26.2; p=0.0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1.36 [1.13-1.62]; p=0.0009)., INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required., FUNDING: National Natural Science Foundation of China, UK Medical Research Council, and National Institute for Health Research Southampton Biomedical Research Centre., TRANSLATION: For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are emotionally vulnerable and have suffered great psychological impacts. Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China., METHODS: A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy., RESULTS: A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression., CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era. These results should help to update guidance for psychological interventions for pregnant women during the period of COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95% CI 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: P = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95% CI 2.86-3.40) for patients 20-39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95% CI 1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95% CI 1.12-1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI 0.98-1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.73-1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older. Our findings should be verified in other populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between income inequality and COVID-19 cases and deaths per million in OECD countries., METHODS: Cross-sectional regression methods are used to model the relationship between income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, and COVID-19 reported cases and deaths per-million., RESULTS: The results demonstrate a significant positive association between income inequality and COVID-19 cases and death per million in all estimated models. A 1% increase in the Gini coefficient is associated with an approximately 4% increase in cases per-million and an approximately 5% increase in deaths per-million., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that countries with high levels of income inequality have performed significantly worse when dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak in terms cases and deaths. Income inequality is a proxy for many elements of socioeconomic disadvantage that may contribute to the spread of, and deaths from, COVID-19. These include poor housing, smoking, obesity and pollution., POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the importance of closing the gap in income inequality and improving the health and incomes of the poorest and most vulnerable groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although women account for up to half of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific data have been reported in this population., AIMS: To assess the burden and impact of cardiovascular comorbidities in women with COVID-19., METHODS: All consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 24 hospitals from 26 February to 20 April 2020 were included. The primary composite outcome was transfer to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death., RESULTS: Among 2878 patients, 1212 (42.1%) were women. Women were older (68.3+/-18.0 vs. 65.4+/-16.0 years; P<0.001), but had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. Among women, 276 (22.8%) experienced the primary outcome, including 161 (13.3%) transfers to an intensive care unit and 115 (9.5%) deaths without transfer to intensive care unit. The rate of in-hospital death or transfer to an intensive care unit was lower in women versus men (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.72). Age (adjusted HR: 1.05 per 5-year increase, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), body mass index (adjusted HR: 1.06 per 2-unit increase, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10), chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.11-2.22) and heart failure (adjusted HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome in women. Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide/N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (adjusted HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.70-3.44) and troponin (adjusted HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.39-2.88) concentrations at admission were also associated with the primary outcome, even in women free of previous coronary artery disease or heart failure., CONCLUSIONS: Although female sex was associated with a lower risk of transfer to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death, COVID-19 remained associated with considerable morbimortality in women, especially in those with cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at increased risk of poor outcome from Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects., RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = - 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049). Angiotensin II receptor type (AGTR)1 and 2 expression was decreased in COPD bronchial biopsies compared to HV-ES controls with log2FC of -0.26 (p = 0.033) and - 0.40, (p = 0.0010), respectively. However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051). Basigin, a newly identified potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor was also upregulated in both brushes, log2FC of 0.17 (p = 0.0040), and bronchial biopsies, (log2FC of 0.18 (p = 0.017), in COPD vs HV-ES. Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 was not differentially regulated between control and COPD. However, various other spike-cleaving proteases were, including TMPRSS4 and Cathepsin B, in both epithelial brushes (log2FC of 0.25 (p = 0.0012) and log2FC of 0.56 (p = 5.49E-06), respectively) and bronchial biopsies (log2FC of 0.49 (p = 0.00021) and log2FC of 0.246 (p = 0.028), respectively)., CONCLUSION: This study identifies key differences in expression of genes related to susceptibility and aetiology of COVID-19 within the COPD lung. Further studies to understand the impact on clinical course of disease are now required.

All subjects underwent two COVID-19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1-4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry., RESULTS: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non-smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 +/- 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender., CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID-19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS-CoV-2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID-19, it is well-established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.

AB  - The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic highlighted the serious problems of health care systems but also threatened the mental and physical health of patients worldwide. The goal of this study was to assess psychological health and insomnia in people with chronic diseases in the time of elevated stress associated with the pandemic. The study involved 879 people from Zachodniopomorskie province in Poland. Each participant provided basic demographic data, data on symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety and information on concomitant diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, heart failure, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Hashimoto's disease and smoking cigarettes. Chronic diseases included in this study showed a strong correlation between Hashimoto's disease and increase scores according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI, r = 0.797, p < 0.001), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7, r = 0.766, p < 0.001) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, r = 0.767, p < 0.001). After the results were corrected for age, gender, diagnosed hypertension, dyslipidemia and cigarette smoking, it was confirmed that the diagnosis of Hashimoto's disease was associated with an increased risk of anxiety (odds ratio (OR) = 2.225; p < 0.001), depression (OR = 2.518; p < 0.001) and insomnia (OR = 3.530; p < 0.001). Our study showed that during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic patients with Hashimoto's disease show a higher risk of insomnia, anxiety and depression.

AB  - AIM: To investigate changes in psychological distress in community-dwelling older adults before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the contribution of frailty transitions and multimorbidity in predicting the psychological distress., METHODS: Prospective repeated-measures cohort study on a sample of participants aged 60 and over. A total of 2, 785 respondents at the baseline (May 2019) were followed during the COVID-19 (August 2020). The changes in psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 were assessed using generalised estimation equations with adjusting for sex, age, education, economic status, marital status, tea drinking status, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, sedentary time, sleep quality and activities of daily living., RESULTS: The psychological distress of older people has significantly increased in August 2020 compared with May 2019. Both older adults who remained frail and transitioned into frail state reported more psychological distress during the COVID-19. Similarly, both pre-existing multimorbidity and emerging multimorbidity groups were associated with more psychological distress. The group of frailty progression who reported new emerging multimorbidity showed more increase in psychological distress in comparison with those who remained in the non-frail state who reported no multimorbidity., CONCLUSION: Psychological distress has increased among the community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, and sustained and progressive frail states as well as multimorbidity were all associated with a greater increase of psychological distress. These findings suggest that future public health measures should take into account the increased psychological distress among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assessment of frailty and multimorbidity might help in warning of psychological distress.

AB  - Recent studies reported sex differences in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aim to analyze sex differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors for disease severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. All adults (185 cases) diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University were included in samples. The median age of all patients was 41 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) of males was relatively higher compared to females (p < 0.001). The proportion of male patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), history of smoking and drinking was higher than females. Male patients developed more clinical symptoms, obtained more abnormal laboratory test results, while they were less aware of care-seeking than female patients. There were no significant differences in clinical complications and outcomes between two groups. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.082; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.034-1.132; p = 0.001) and BMI (OR: 1.237; 95% CI: 1.041-1.47; p = 0.016) were considered risk factors for refractory pneumonia in multivariate regression analysis. The findings of the current study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to affect older males with comorbidities. Further researches into factors underlying obesity and disease severity may provide mechanistic insight into COVID-19 development. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term consequences of COVID-19 remain unclear. There is concern a proportion of patients will progress to develop pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to assess the temporal change in CXR infiltrates in a cohort of patients following hospitalisation for COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between 20th March and 3rd June 2020. Patients were approached for standard-of-care follow-up 12-weeks after hospitalisation. Inpatient and follow-up CXRs were scored by the assessing clinician for extent of pulmonary infiltrates; 0-4 per lung (Nil = 0, < 25% = 1, 25-50% = 2, 51-75% = 3, > 75% = 4)., RESULTS: 101 patients with paired CXRs were included. Demographics: 53% male with a median (IQR) age 53.0 (45-63) years and length of stay 9 (5-17.5) days. The median CXR follow-up interval was 82 (77-86) days with median baseline and follow-up CXR scores of 4.0 (3-5) and 0.0 (0-1) respectively. 32% of patients had persistent CXR abnormality at 12-weeks. In multivariate analysis length of stay (LOS), smoking-status and obesity were identified as independent risk factors for persistent CXR abnormality. Serum LDH was significantly higher at baseline and at follow-up in patients with CXR abnormalities compared to those with resolution. A 5-point composite risk score (1-point each; LOS >= 15 days, Level 2/3 admission, LDH > 750 U/L, obesity and smoking-status) strongly predicted risk of persistent radiograph abnormality (0.81)., CONCLUSION: Persistent CXR abnormality 12-weeks post COVID-19 was common in this cohort. LOS, obesity, increased serum LDH, and smoking-status were risk factors for radiograph abnormality. These findings require further prospective validation.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality ratios (IFR) remain controversially discussed with implications for political measures. The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020, with particularly high case fatality ratio (CFR). To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged >=14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for >=85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, and 13.2% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.

AB  - Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world. The Serbian government declared a state of emergency on 15 March 2020, implementing some of Europe's strictest measures to combat the pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the mental health of the general adult Serbian population and to identify associated factors during the state of emergency and lockdown. Data were collected with a snowball sampling method between 23 March and 25 April 2020, by using an online questionnaire. Multiple ordinal regression was performed to establish the associations between socio-demographic characteristics, self-estimated health status, and depression, anxiety, and stress. Out of 1057 participants included in the study, 28.9%, 36.9%, and 38.1% reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Uneasiness related to COVID-19 news, the feeling of helplessness, likeliness of impending death, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms were associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores. Current smoking status was associated with a higher risk of depression and stress. Students had a significantly higher level of depression and stress, while older age was protective against anxiety and stress. Higher socioeconomic status was significantly associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.

AB  - We retrospectively evaluated 2879 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from four hospitals to evaluate the ability of demographic data, medical history, and on-admission laboratory parameters to predict in-hospital mortality. Association of previously published risk factors (age, gender, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity, renal failure, cardiovascular/ pulmonary diseases, serum ferritin, lymphocyte count, APTT, PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and platelet count) with death was tested by a multivariate logistic regression, and a predictive model was created, with further validation in an independent sample. A total of 2070 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were finally included in the multivariable analysis. Age 61-70 years (p<0.001; OR: 7.69; 95%CI: 2.93 to 20.14), age 71-80 years (p<0.001; OR: 14.99; 95%CI: 5.88 to 38.22), age >80 years (p<0.001; OR: 36.78; 95%CI: 14.42 to 93.85), male gender (p<0.001; OR: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.31 to 2.58), D-dimer levels >2 ULN (p = 0.003; OR: 1.79; 95%CI: 1.22 to 2.62), and prolonged PT (p<0.001; OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.49 to 3.18) were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. A predictive model performed with these parameters showed an AUC of 0.81 in the development cohort (n = 1270) [sensitivity of 95.83%, specificity of 41.46%, negative predictive value of 98.01%, and positive predictive value of 24.85%]. These results were then validated in an independent data sample (n = 800). Our predictive model of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients has been developed, calibrated and validated. The model (MRS-COVID) included age, male gender, and on-admission coagulopathy markers as positively correlated factors with fatal outcome.

PY  - 2021
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We reviewed the current data on infections associated with rituximab use published over the last 5 years., RECENT FINDINGS: New literature was available on rates of serious infections, Hepatitis B reactivation and screening, and infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Rates of infection varied by study and population, however, higher risk of infection in patients with underlying rheumatologic diseases was seen in those who required a therapy switch, had a smoking history, and those undergoing retreatment who had a serious infection with their first course of therapy. With regards to HBV, the proportion of patients screened continues to be inadequate. Despite the upfront cost, HBV screening and prophylaxis were found to be cost effective. There is still limited data regarding COVID-19 severity in the setting of rituximab, however, rituximab, especially in combination with steroids, may lead to more severe disease and higher mortality.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus imposes a higher risk of complications and mortality among people with mental disorders. Until widely available vaccines, adherence to preventive behaviours remains the most crucial tool to prevent SARS/COVID-19 virus transmission. Our review focuses on the determinants of adherence behaviours., RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence behaviours include the use of a face mask and protective gloves, personal hygienic behaviours (handwashing or using hand sanitiser), and keeping physical distance and avoiding social gatherings. In almost all studies, males and younger people show less adherence. Risk perception and health beliefs (especially perceived severity of COVID-19 related conditions) can explain the sex and age differences in adherence. Studies covering the impact of mental disorders on adherence are surprisingly missing, with the exception of smoking., SUMMARY: Engaging men and young people in adopting preventive behaviours is crucial in protecting the whole community and specific vulnerable populations. There is a lack of studies investigating preventive behaviours among people living with mental disorders and addiction problems. Furthermore, descriptive and intervention studies are needed to understand and improve the adherence of this population to preventive behaviours. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals with schizophrenia may be at an increased risk for COVID-19 morbidity due to the disease characteristics. In this study, we aimed to explore the odds of significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among schizophrenia patients while controlling for potential sociodemographic and medical confounders., METHODS: Schizophrenia patients and age-and-sex matched controls (total n = 51 078) were assessed for frequency of COVID-19 positivity, hospitalizations, and mortality. The odds for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality were calculated using logistic regression models, while controlling for age, sex, marital status, sector, socioeconomic status, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease., RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia were less likely to test positive for COVID-19; however, they were twice as likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR 2.15 95% CI 1.63-2.82, P < .0001), even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors (OR 1.88 95% CI 1.39-2.55, P < .0001). Furthermore, they were 3 times more likely to experience COVID-19 mortality (OR 3.27 95% CI 1.39-7.68, P < .0001), compared to controls., CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of associations between schizophrenia and increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality compared to controls regardless of sociodemographic and medical factors. As these patients present with a combination of potential risk factors for mortality, efforts should be made to minimize the effects of the pandemic on this vulnerable population.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle changes of the general population, and on admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods and Results: All ACS admissions during the COVID-19 lockdown (10 March to 4 May, 2020), in 3 municipalities (3 spoke, and 1 hub hospital), in Southwestern Greece (411,576 inhabitants), were prospectively recorded and compared to the equivalent periods during 2018, and 2019. A telephone survey of 1014 participants was conducted to explore the lifestyle habits of citizens aged >=35-years-old before and during lockdown. The median ACS incidence rate decreased from 19.0 cases per week in 2018 and 21.5 in 2019 down to 13.0 in 2020 (RR: 0.66 during the Covid-19 lockdown; 95%CI: 0.53-0.82; P = 0.0002). This was driven by a significant reduction of admissions for Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (RR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.52-0.88; P = 0.0037), mainly in patients with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors, as we noticed an inverse association between the reduction of the incidence of ACS during the Covid-19 lockdown period and the number of registered patient risk factors. There was no difference in the rates of STEMI and population-based all-cause mortality across the examined time periods. The telephone survey demonstrated reduction of passive smoking, working hours, alcohol, junk food and salt consumption, and an increase in sleeping hours, mainly in participants with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: A significant decline in ACS admissions during the COVID-19 lockdown was noted, affecting mainly NSTEMI patients with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors. This was accompanied by significant lifestyle changes. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that to some extend the latter might be associated with the observed decline in ACS admissions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health measures introduced to control it, on mental health, is largely unknown. Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece., METHODS: All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)., RESULTS: Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score>=13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety, but not depression levels of pregnant women in Greece. Population level interventions to address adverse effects on anxiety status in the initial phases of similar situations may be helpful in the future.

AB  - The burden of COVID-19 has been noted to be disproportionately greater in minority women, a population that is nevertheless still understudied in COVID-19 research. We conducted an observational study to examine COVID-19-associated mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes after testing (henceforth index) among a racially diverse adult women veteran population. We assembled a retrospective cohort from a Veterans Affairs (VA) national COVID-19 shared data repository, collected between February and August 2020. A case was defined as a woman veteran who tested positive for SARS-COV-2, and a control as a woman veteran who tested negative. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model to examine the distribution of time to death and the effects of baseline predictors on mortality risk. We used generalized linear models to examine 60-day cardiovascular disease outcomes. Covariates studied included age, body mass index (BMI), and active smoking status at index, and pre-existing conditions of diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of treatment with antiplatelet or anti-thrombotic drug at any time in the 2 years prior to the index date. Women veterans who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had 4 times higher mortality risk than women veterans who tested negative (Hazard Ratio 3.8, 95% Confidence Interval CI 2.92 to 4.89) but had lower risk of cardiovascular events (Odds Ratio OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92) and developing new heart disease conditions within 60 days (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.77). Older age, obesity (BMI > 30), and prior CVD and COPD conditions were positively associated with increased mortality in 60 days. Despite a higher infection rate among minority women veterans, there was no significant race difference in mortality, cardiovascular events, or onset of heart disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased short-term mortality risk among women veterans similarly across race groups. However, there was no evidence of increased cardiovascular disease incidence in 60 days. A longer follow-up of women veterans who tested positive is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency in Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka prefectures on April 7, 2020; this was extended to the remaining prefectures on April 16, 2020. The state of emergency was lifted on May 25, 2020. Although it was known that breast cancer screening was postponed or canceled during this period, the actual extent of postponement or cancellation has not been clarified., METHODS: We investigated postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening between April and May 2020 using a cross-sectional, web-based, self-reported questionnaire survey. In addition, we examined the association between socioeconomic and health-related factors and postponement or cancellation by multivariable log-binominal regression., RESULTS: Among 1874 women aged 30-79 years who had scheduled breast cancer screening during the study period, 493 women (26.3%) postponed or canceled screening. While women aged 30-39 years and 70-79 years postponed or canceled less frequently than women aged 40-49 years (prevalence ratio = 0.62 and 0.56, respectively), there was no significant difference between age groups in the women aged 40-69 years. Postponement or cancellation was more frequent in five prefectures, where the state of emergency was declared early (prevalence ratio = 1.25). Employment status, annual household income, family structure, academic background, smoking status, and fear of COVID-19 were not associated with postponement or cancellation., CONCLUSION: Although care should be taken with the interpretation of these findings due to possible biases, they suggest that the postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening might be due more to facility suspension than to individual factors. It is necessary to explore the ideal way of encouraging breast cancer screening uptake, in an environment of coexistence with COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.

AB  - Understanding sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory risk factors in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is critically important, and requires building large and diverse COVID-19 cohorts with both retrospective information and prospective follow-up. A large Health Information Exchange (HIE) in Southeast Texas, which assembles and shares electronic health information among providers to facilitate patient care, was leveraged to identify COVID-19 patients, create a cohort, and identify risk factors for both favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The initial sample consists of 8,874 COVID-19 patients ascertained from the pandemic's onset to June 12th, 2020 and was created for the analyses shown here. We gathered demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical data from patient's encounters across the healthcare system. Tobacco use history was examined as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 fatality along with age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. Of the 8,874 patients included in the cohort, 475 died from COVID-19. Of the 5,356 patients who had information on history of tobacco use, over 26% were current or former tobacco users. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of COVID-19 fatality increased among those who were older (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08), male (1.91, 95% CI 1.58, 2.31), and had a history of tobacco use (2.45, 95% CI 1.93, 3.11). History of tobacco use remained significantly associated (1.65, 95% CI 1.27, 2.13) with COVID-19 fatality after adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This effort demonstrates the impact of having an HIE to rapidly identify a cohort, aggregate sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and laboratory data across disparate healthcare providers electronic health record (HER) systems, and follow the cohort over time. These HIE capabilities enable clinical specialists and epidemiologists to conduct outcomes analyses during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Tobacco use appears to be an important risk factor for COVID-19 related death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Key workers played a pivotal role during the national lockdown in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although protective measures have been taken, the impact of the pandemic on key workers is yet to be fully elucidated., METHODS: Participants were from four longitudinal age-homogeneous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970 and 1958). A web-based survey provided outcome data during the first UK national lockdown (May 2020) on COVID-19 infection status, changes in financial situation, trust in government, conflict with people around, household composition, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, smoking and sleep duration. Generalised linear models with logit link assessed the association between being a key worker and the above outcomes. Adjustment was made for cohort design, non-response, sex, ethnicity, adult socioeconomic position (SEP), childhood SEP, the presence of a chronic illness and receipt of a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts., FINDINGS: 13 736 participants were included. During lockdown, being a key worker was associated with increased chances of being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68) and experiencing conflict with people around (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). However, key workers were less likely to be worse off financially (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), to consume more alcohol (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) or to smoke more (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.80) during lockdown. Interestingly, being a key worker was not associated with psychological distress (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05)., INTERPRETATION: Being a key worker during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown was a double-edged sword, with both benefits and downsides. The UK government had the basic duty to protect its key workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it may have failed to do so, and there is an urgent need to rectify this in light of the ongoing third wave.

AB  - Prolonged social isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown has adversely impacted the mental, social, and physical wellbeing of the global populace. Coping with mental and physical stressors amidst the global lockdown is especially strenuous for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and more (LGBT+) community, who are frequently subjected to social stigma and minority stress. Systematic stigma and discrimination place LGBT+ individuals at higher risk for deleterious behaviors, such as substance abuse (e.g., injection drug use, smoking, alcohol) and risky sexual practices (e.g., anal/vaginal/oral sex). Maladaptive coping behaviors consequently increase the chances of HIV/AIDS risk among LGBT+ individuals, compared to heterosexual individuals. LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS perpetually face higher rates of unemployment, income disparity, and intimate partner violence. Prolonged home confinement, and impaired accessibility to healthcare, legal, and criminal justice services during lockdown may deplete the quality of life of LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is critical that multidisciplinary service providers, including health professionals, employers, social services providers, educational institutions and community organizations, move toward online service delivery, so that homebound HIV-positive LGBT+ individuals are secured with a wide range of care options. Non-judgemental, tele-counseling may bridge the gap to mental health services. Community clinics catering to HIV-positive and/or LGBT+ clients may consider precociously supplying essential amenities, such as Preexposure (PrEP)/postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), condoms, emergency contraception, and sterile needles. Lastly, efforts directed at the sustenance of at-risk/HIV-positive LGBT+ health should persevere, even after the pandemic. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - This article focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on smoking and smoking cessation behaviours and support for smoke-free zones in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested structured survey was distributed by email in October-November 2020 to students and staff at the University of Jeddah. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics with summative content analysis of open text. Participants providing open text comments (n = 374/666; 56.4%) were non-smokers (n = 293; 78.3%), former smokers (n = 26; 7.0%) and current smokers (n = 55; 14.7%). Some had household members (n = 220; 58.8%) and friends who smoke (n = 198; 52.9%) plus daily exposure to secondhand smoke at home (n = 125; 33.4%). There was an awareness during COVID-19 of: smoking inside cafes/restaurants and other indoor and outdoor public places; exposure to warnings in the media both against and promoting smoking; widespread support for smoke-free zones. Smokers plans for accessing smoking cessation support are inconsistent with retrospective reports. Many express positivity highlighting reductions in smoking but there were also negative reports of increased smoking. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of society worldwide. People have been at home more with restricted freedom of movement and limitations on social liberty. These individual accounts can help to focus evidence-based smoking prevention and cessation programmes during and post-COVID-19.

AB  - Objective: Exposure to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was associated with high risk of mental health problems among frontline nurses. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its impact on quality of life (QOL) in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China., Methods: An online study was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Depression and QOL were assessed using standardized instruments., Results: A total of 1,757 participants were recruited. The prevalence of depression was 33.75% (95% CI: 31.59%-35.97%). Results emerging from multiple logistic regression analysis showed that direct care of COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.441, 95% CI: 1.031-2.013, P = 0.032), and current smoking (OR: 2.880, 95% CI: 1.018-8.979, P = 0.048) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, ENT nurses with depression had a lower overall QOL compared to those without depression (F(1, 1757)= 536.80, P < 0.001)., Conclusions: Depression was common among ENT nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Considering the negative impact of depression on QOL and care quality, regular screening for depression should be conducted in ENT nurses and treatment should be provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence represents a crucial developmental period in shaping mental health trajectories. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use during this sensitive developmental stage., METHODS: In this longitudinal, population-based study, surveys were administered to a nationwide sample of 13-18-year-olds in Iceland in October or February in 2016 and 2018, and in October, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The surveys assessed depressive symptoms with the Symptom Checklist-90, mental wellbeing with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Demographic data were collected, which included language spoken at home although not ethnicity data. We used mixed effects models to study the effect of gender, age, and survey year on trends in mental health outcomes., FINDINGS: 59 701 survey responses were included; response rates ranged from 63% to 86%. An increase in depressive symptoms (beta 0.57, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.60) and worsened mental wellbeing (beta -0.46, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.42) were observed across all age groups during the pandemic compared with same-aged peers before COVID-19. These outcomes were significantly worse in adolescent girls compared with boys (beta 4.16, 95% CI 4.05 to 4.28, and beta -1.13, 95% CI -1.23 to -1.03, respectively). Cigarette smoking (OR 2.61, 95% CI 2.59 to 2.66), e-cigarette use (OR 2.61, 95% CI 2.59 to 2.64), and alcohol intoxication (OR 2.59, 95% CI 2.56 to 2.64) declined among 15-18-year-olds during COVID-19, with no similar gender differences., INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that COVID-19 has significantly impaired adolescent mental health. However, the decrease observed in substance use during the pandemic might be an unintended benefit of isolation, and might serve as a protective factor against future substance use disorders and dependence. Population-level prevention efforts, especially for girls, are warranted., FUNDING: Icelandic Research Fund., TRANSLATION: For the Icelandic translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of global cancer incidence and mortality, accounting for an estimated 2 million diagnoses and 1.8 million deaths. Neoplasms of the lungs are the second most common cancer diagnosis in men and women (after prostate and breast cancer, respectively). With increasing access to tobacco and industrialization in developing nations, lung cancer incidence is rising globally. The average age of diagnosis is 70 years old. Men are twice as likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, which largely reflects differences in tobacco consumption, although women may be more susceptible due to higher proportions of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and the effects of oestrogen. African American men in the US are at the highest risk of lung cancer. Family history increases risk by 1.7-fold, with a greater risk among first-degree relatives. Tobacco smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death worldwide, accounting for up to 90% of lung cancer cases, and continued consumption is projected to increase global cancer incidence, particularly in developing nations such as China, Russia, and India. Second-hand smoke among children and spouses has likewise been implicated. Radon from natural underground uranium decay is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the developed world. Occupational hazards such as asbestos and environmental exposures such as air pollution, arsenic, and HIV and Tb infection have all been implicated in lung carcinogenesis, while cannabis smoking, electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and COVID-19 have been hypothesized to increase risk.

AB  - Background: While pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) appears to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), data on patients with CVD and concomitant cancer is limited. Evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19. Methods: Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Associationa TMs COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested. Results: Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-6.24; p<0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR=1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 - 1.76; p=0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.05-2.80; p=0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR=1.18, 95% CI: 0.99 - 1.41; p=0.07). Conclusion: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.

AB  - Background: Elevated screen time has been associated with addictive behaviors, such as alcohol and sugar intake and smoking. Considering the substantial increase in screen time caused by social isolation policies, this study aimed to analyze the association of increased screen time in different devices during the COVID-19 pandemic with consumption and increased desire of alcohol, smoking, and sweetened foods in adults. Methods: A sample of 1,897 adults with a mean age of 37.9 (13.3) years was assessed by an online survey, being composed by 58% of women. Participants were asked whether screen time in television, cell phone, and computer increased during the pandemic, as well as how much time is spent in each device. Closed questions assessed the frequency of alcohol and sweetened food consumption, smoking, and an increased desire to drink and smoke during the pandemic. Educational level, age, sex, feeling of stress, anxiety, depression, and use of a screen device for physical activity were covariates. Binary logistic regression models considered adjustment for covariates and for mutual habits. Results: Increased television time was associated with increased desire to drink (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12; 1.89) and increased sweetened food consumption (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.18; 1.99), while an increase in computer use was negatively associated with consumption of alcohol (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53; 0.86) and sweetened foods (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62; 0.98). Increased cell phone time was associated with increased sweetened food consumption during the pandemic (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18; 2.67). Participants with increased time in the three devices were less likely to consume sweetened foods for >=5 days per week (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.39; 0.99) but were twice as likely to have sweetened food consumption increased during pandemic (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.07; 3.88). Conclusion: Increased screen time was differently associated with consumption and desire for alcohol and sweets according to screen devices. Increased time in television and cell phones need to be considered for further investigations of behavioral impairments caused by the pandemic.

AB  - Identification of high-risk patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 may inform management strategies. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine factors associated with mortality among adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care by searching databases for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 6 December 2020. Observational studies of COVID-19 adults admitted to critical care were included. Studies of mixed cohorts and intensive care cohorts restricted to a specific patient sub-group were excluded. Dichotomous variables were reported with pooled OR and 95%CI, and continuous variables with pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI. Fifty-eight studies (44,305 patients) were included in the review. Increasing age (SMD 0.65, 95%CI 0.53-0.77); smoking (OR 1.40, 95%CI 1.03-1.90); hypertension (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.29-1.85); diabetes (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.22-1.63); cardiovascular disease (OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.52-2.38); respiratory disease (OR 1.75, 95%CI 1.33-2.31); renal disease (OR 2.39, 95%CI 1.68-3.40); and malignancy (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.30-2.52) were associated with mortality. A higher sequential organ failure assessment score (SMD 0.86, 95%CI 0.63-1.10) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation-2 score (SMD 0.89, 95%CI 0.65-1.13); a lower PaO2 :FI O2 (SMD -0.44, 95%CI -0.62 to -0.26) and the need for mechanical ventilation at admission (OR 2.53, 95%CI 1.90-3.37) were associated with mortality. Higher white cell counts (SMD 0.37, 95%CI 0.22-0.51); neutrophils (SMD 0.42, 95%CI 0.19-0.64); D-dimers (SMD 0.56, 95%CI 0.43-0.69); ferritin (SMD 0.32, 95%CI 0.19-0.45); lower platelet (SMD -0.22, 95%CI -0.35 to -0.10); and lymphocyte counts (SMD -0.37, 95%CI -0.54 to -0.19) were all associated with mortality. In conclusion, increasing age, pre-existing comorbidities, severity of illness based on validated scoring systems, and the host response to the disease were associated with mortality; while male sex and increasing BMI were not. These factors have prognostic relevance for patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Association of Anaesthetists.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the changes in health behaviors among students of a French university during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online retrospective survey was distributed to Rouen-Normandy University students at the end of the COVID-19 lockdown (13th March-11th May 2020). Voluntary university students were included. Data collected were on socio-demographics, academic environment, COVID19 concerns, tobacco smoking, binge drinking, cannabis use, and physical activity in the periods before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The survey was completed by 3671 university students (mean age 20.9 +/- 2.47 years, 72.9% female). Significantly favorable changes between the periods before and during COVID-19 were reported for tobacco smoking (18.5% vs. 14.8%), binge drinking (35.9% vs. 9.3%) and cannabis use (5.6% vs. 3.2%) and unfavorable changes for moderate (79.4% vs. 67.9%) and vigorous physical activity (62.5% vs. 59.1%). After logistic regression, factors associated with unfavorable changes in tobacco smoking and with favorable changes in vigorous physical activity were the worry of not validating the academic year and stress related to changes in the mode of teaching, respectively. For each health behavior, unfavorable changes were associated with higher depression levels, and male gender. Then as a decrease, mainly in binge drinking was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown, care must be taken to prevent university students from resuming binge drinking after the end of the lockdown. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive mental health and promoting physical activity should be developed for university students to better manage future lockdown periods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are often under significant pressures that may predispose them to symptoms of poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. And, it also aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August, 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting, as well as the HADS. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple linear regression analysis were performed., RESULTS: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD = 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the final analysis. The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability (alpha = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (p < 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about one's profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for screening for mental health concerns, and employing early intervention to help these individuals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has variable clinical, sinonasal, and smell/taste outcomes., METHODS: Observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Amman, Jordan. Demographic data, clinical presentation and smoking status were collected. Sinonasal symptoms, using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire, were evaluated. Smell/taste dysfunction was followed for three months., RESULTS: Ninety-Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty-six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3% had cough, 52.3% sore throat and 48.8% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non-smokers. Smell/taste dysfunction affected 25.6% of patients, but was the first symptom in only one patient. Fourteen of 22 symptoms in SNOT-22 had significant increase. The overall average of symptoms scores increased from 0.472 to 1.034, with smell/taste dysfunction to have the most increment. The latter symptom recovered completely in 81% and dysgeusia developed in 9.5% at three months, and it recovered completely in all patients at six months., CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 may produce severe lower airways disease, it has modest effect on nose and paranasal sinuses. Moreover, smell/taste dysfunction is a prominent symptom, but it usually recovers dramatically. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional study (Miyara et al, 2020) conducted by French researchers showed that the rate of current daily smoking was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 than in the French general population, implying a potentially protective effect of smoking., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the dissemination of the Miyara et al study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes toward smoking occurred after its publication as preprint on April 21, 2020., METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14 and May 4, 2020, by the Tweepy stream application programming interface, using a COVID-19-related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1929 tweets were classified into three groups: (1) tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study before it was published, (2) tweets that were not related to Miyara et al study after it was published, and (3) tweets that were related to Miyara et al study after it was published. The attitudes toward smoking, as expressed in the tweets, were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in the statistical analysis software R (The R Foundation)., RESULTS: Temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed that the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to the Miyara et al study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than the proportion in tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study, either before (44/126, 34.9%; P<.001) or after the Miyara et al study was published (68/198, 34.3%; P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The public's attitude toward smoking shifted in a positive direction after the Miyara et al study found a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases among daily smokers.

AB  - The ConVid - Behavior Survey was conducted in Brazil from April 24 to May 24, 2020, aiming to investigate changes in lifestyles and health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we present the conception and methodology of the research. We used a cross-sectional study using an Internet questionnaire, with questions validated in previous health surveys. The sampling method "virtual snowball" was used, as well as post-stratification procedures. The results related to chronic non-communicable diseases and pre-pandemic lifestyles were compared with estimates from the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey and 2019 Surveillance of Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey. The total sample was 45,161 people. After data weighing, the sample distributions of demographic variables were similar to population variables. Only people with a low schooling level were underrepresented. The comparison with the previous results showed similarity in most estimates: recommended consumption of fruits and vegetables (22.1%), recommended physical activity (35.2%), tobacco smoking habit (12.3%), frequent and abusive alcohol consumption (6.7%), obesity (21.2%), self-reported prevalence of hypertension (18.6%), diabetes (7.1%), and heart disease (4.4%). The online survey made it possible to know the population's health conditions during the pandemic. The similarity of the indicators with those obtained in traditional research allowed the validation of the mean estimates. Studies are needed to investigate how the endogenous effects of virtual social networks can be considered when estimating variance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL., RESULTS: Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score., CONCLUSION: We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify the risk factors for COVID-19 pneumonia and to characterize the epidemiology of the disease., METHODS: This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory symptoms, enrolled between April 12 and April 30 of 2020. Pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of abnormal chest CT findings. At admission, we performed a complete blood count, as well as determining serum levels of CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). Comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and smoking habits were noted. We also analyzed the risk factors for development of COVID-19 pneumonia., RESULTS: We evaluated 124 patients (79 males) with a mean age of 38 +/- 16.6 years. Fever was observed in 67 patients (54.0%), fatigue, cough, and dyspnea being observed in 94 (75.8%), 86 (69.3%), and 37 (29.8%), respectively. Of the 124 patients, 77 (62.1%) developed pneumonia. Common comorbidities in the patients with pneumonia were hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. D-dimer > 0.5 microg/mL (OR = 8.6; 95% CI: 3.32 - 22.26, p < 0.001); 25(OH)D < 20 microg/dL (OR = 6.75; 95% CI: 2.81 - 16.21, p < 0.001); and age > 60 years (OR = 15.66; 95% CI: 2.02 - 121.40, p < 0.001) were variables showing significant correlation with COVID-19 pneumonia., CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D deficiency, high D-dimer levels, and advanced age are associated with a greater risk of developing COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and relevant prevention and control measures may affect the mental health and induce depressive symptoms in fathers with concurrent partner delivery exposure. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression in fathers with simultaneous exposure to COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of family functions on paternal perinatal depression (PPD) risk., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the perinatal fathers recruited in a large tertiary hospital in Wuhan across the whole pandemic period from 31 December 2019 to 11 April 2020. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and APGAR family function scale were used to evaluate PPD and family function, respectively. Chi-square test and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model were applied for data analysis., RESULTS: Among the 1187 participants, the prevalence of PPD was 13.82% throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with that in the time period before the announcement of human-to-human transmission on 19 January 2020, the depression risk was significantly lower during the traffic restriction (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.86) and public transportation reopening periods (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.59). Poor/fair family functions was associated with elevated depression risk (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.90, 4.52). Individuals reporting a low family income and smoking had high depression risks., CONCLUSIONS: A declined risk of PPD was observed over the traffic restriction period of the COVID-19 pandemic. An improved family function may help alleviate the risk of PPD during the pandemic. Health authorities are recommended to formulate targeted prevention and control strategies to handle PPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every individual's life. It has been shown that mortality in people with underlying diseases including diabetes has been very high. The present study aimed to measure diabetes related worries (outcome) and their associations with social support and lifestyle (exposures) amongst people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was completed by 928 respondents (>18 years) between 15-11-2020 and 12-12-2020. The questionnaire comprised four sections: socio-demographic details, diabetic-related worries, social support, and behavioral changes due to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, correlations and hierarchical regression analysis were performed in the study., RESULTS: Data from 928 respondents (51.61% male; mean age = 52.48 [SD = 11.76]; age range = 18-86 years) were analyzed. The mean score for COVID-19 specific diabetes worries was 3.13 out of 8. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the mean COVID-19-specific diabetes worries score was significantly associated with lower age, cigarette smoking, perceived poor health status, presence of other diabetic complications. Lack of social support from family, friends, work colleagues and diabetes care team and also eating more than usual were also significantly associated with COVID-19 specific diabetes worry., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes related worries were strongly associated with a lack of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings suggest the need of social support as well as improving knowledge and guidelines is important for people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 are important for epidemiology, clinical management, and infection control. Limitations of oro-nasopharyngeal real-time PCR sensitivity have been described based on comparisons of single tests with repeated sampling. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 PCR clinical sensitivity using a clinical and radiological reference standard., METHODS: Between March-May 2020, 2060 patients underwent thoracic imaging and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Imaging was independently double- or triple-reported (if discordance) by blinded radiologists according to radiological criteria for COVID-19. We excluded asymptomatic patients and those with alternative diagnoses that could explain imaging findings. Associations with PCR-positivity were assessed with binomial logistic regression., RESULTS: 901 patients had possible/probable imaging features and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and 429 patients met the clinical and radiological reference case definition. SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity was 68% (95% confidence interval 64-73), was highest 7-8 days after symptom onset (78% (68-88)) and was lower among current smokers (adjusted odds ratio 0.23 (0.12-0.42) p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinical and imaging features of COVID-19, PCR test sensitivity was 68%, and was lower among smokers; a finding that could explain observations of lower disease incidence and that warrants further validation. PCR tests should be interpreted considering imaging, symptom duration and smoking status. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To investigate the COVID-19 pandemic related alteration of health promoting behaviour during lockdown among medical students compared to other students. In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1940 Bavarian students. Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire 3 weeks after lockdown implementation, evaluating their lifestyle behaviour focusing on self-reported and objectively assessed physical activity.1154 medical (59.5%) and 786 non-medical (40.5%) students were included (median age 22.0 [IQR, 20.0-25.0], 71.5% female). Physical activity decreased in both groups after lockdown implementation. During lockdown, medical students reported higher physical activity levels compared to non-medical students. This was corroborated by daily step count data assessed by wearables (median steps per day [IQR], 6979 [5218-9348] versus 6581 [4497-8491], p = 0.02). Smoking behaviour during lockdown did not differ between medical and non-medical students (increased in 11.8% vs 13.6%, decreased in 31.9% versus 36.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, alteration of lifestyle behaviour among medical students was significantly different compared to non-medical students. This result suggests that medical students are more concerned about health promoting behaviour even in crisis situations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in daily habits, food choices and lifestyle of adult Brazilians before and during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: This observational study was carried out with Brazilian adults through an online questionnaire 5 months after the social distance measures implementation. The McNemar, McNemar-Bowker and Wilcoxon tests were used to investigate differences before and during the COVID pandemic period, adopting the statistical significance of P < 0.05., SETTING: Brazil., PARTICIPANTS: Totally, 1368 volunteers aged 18+ years., RESULTS: The volunteers reported a lower frequency of breakfast, morning and lunch snacks (P < 0.05) and a higher frequency of evening snacks and other meal categories during the pandemic period (P < 0.05). The results showed an increase in the consumption of bakery products, instant meals and fast food, while the consumption of vegetables and fruits decreased (P < 0.005). There was a significant increase in the frequency of consumption of alcoholic beverages (P < 0.001), but a reduction in the dose (P < 0.001), increased frequency of smoking (P = 0.007), an increase in sleep and screen time in hours and decrease in physical activity (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to observe an increase in screen time, hours of sleep, smoking and drinking frequency. On the other hand, there was a reduction in the dose of alcoholic beverages but also in the practice of physical activity. Eating habits also changed, reducing the performance of daytime meals and increasing the performance of nighttime meals. The frequency of consumption of instant meals and fast food has increased, while consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following lockdown on physical exercise (PEx) practice, pain, and psychological well-being., METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric study was performed using a nonrandom convenience sampling from the general population (>=18 years-old) of 6 countries (Brazil, Italy, France, Portugal, Germany, and Spain) adopting social isolation (SI). The validated self-administered online survey (PEF-COVID19) was used. The tests T-test and Chi-square with Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analysis and a multivariate logistic regression model (p < 0.05)., RESULTS: We included 3194 replies and ~80% of the respondents were in SI. Brazilian sample was highly influenced by the pandemic considering PEx practice and habits, pain, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05). Among the European countries, Italy presented the major changes. The model to predict the non-practice of PEx during SI showed that the variables countries, smoking, SI, and PEx level were significant predictors (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The pandemic changed the PEx practice and habits, and the psychological well-being of populations in different manners. Countries, smoking, SI, and PEx level were predictors for the non-practice of PEx. Public health strategies are suggested to avoid sedentary lifestyles and quality of life decrease.

AB  - The present study aimed to verify the effect of a warm-up protocol with and without facemask-use on cognitive function. The sample was composed of 17 healthy, non-smoking physical education students (age = 17.6 years, height = 1.71 m, and body mass = 69.7 kg). They were randomized to perform 15 min of warm-up exercises, while wearing a cloth facemask (EXP) or no mask (CON) on two separate occasions, with at least 48-h separating conditions. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and d2 Attention assessment were used to verify cognitive function, using a repeated measures general linear model. The warm-up improved cognitive abilities and the results demonstrated significant differences between the EXP vs. CON groups in post-concentration performance (186.06 +/- 15.47 EXP-score vs. 178.12 +/- 13.66 CON-score), post the total number of errors (23.47 +/- 14.50 EXP-frequency < 29.06 +/- 13.74 CON-frequency), and in the post RPE (6.0 +/- 1.37 EXP-index > 4.7 +/- 0.85 CON-index). Wearing a cloth facemask caused positive effects on cognitive function. This data suggests that wearing a cloth facemask during warm-up may stimulate/improve the cognitive function.

AB  - Though the current preponderance of evidence indicates the toxicity associated with the smoking of tobacco products through conventional means, less is known about the role of "vaping" in respiratory disease. "Vaping" is described as the use of electronic cigarettes (E-Cigarettes or E-Cigs), which has only more recently been available to the public (~10 years) but has quickly emerged as a popular means of tobacco consumption worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 can easily be transmitted between people in close proximity through direct contact or respiratory droplets to develop coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). Symptoms of COVID-19 range from a mild flu-like illness with high fever to severe respiratory distress syndrome and death. The risk factors for increased disease severity remain unclear. Herein, we utilize a murine-tropic coronavirus (beta coronavirus) MHV-A59 along with a mouse model and measures of pathology (lung weight/dry ratios and histopathology) and inflammation (ELISAs and cytokine array panels) to examine whether vaping may exacerbate the pulmonary disease severity of coronavirus disease. While vaping alone did result in some noted pathology, mice exposed with intranasal vaped e-liquid suffered more severe mortality due to pulmonary inflammation than controls when exposed to coronavirus infection. Our data suggest a role for vaping in increased coronavirus pulmonary disease in a mouse model. Furthermore, our data indicate that disease exacerbation may involve calcium (Ca2+) dysregulation, identifying a potential therapeutic intervention.

The present study was conducted with an aim to assess these changes brought about because of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions., Methods: The web-survey aimed to understand the immediate impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on people by using a structured questionnaire collecting demographic, lifestyle, and dietary information. The survey was disseminated online among the literate, urban, adult population with internet access., Results: Of the 1,200 people who received the survey, a total of 1,008 respondents participated in the study, aged between 18 and 81 years (Median- 24). An increase in daily screen time has been observed in 56.7% of the population. A decrease in work-related stress was observed in 43% of the population, sleep pattern improved in 36.7% people, and 27.1% of the inactive population showed increased physical activity. A significant decrease in the proportion of people consuming junk food (73.8%), alcohol (27.6%), and smoking (8.1%) was observed., Conclusions: The present web-based survey study suggests a significant change in the lifestyle and dietary patterns of people brought about because of the COVID-19 lockdown most highly seen as a major increase in screen usage and a decrease in junk food consumption.

AU  - Brenner, David J
PY  - 2021
AB  - PURPOSE: The respiratory disease COVID-19 reached global pandemic status in 2020. Excessive inflammation is believed to result in the most severe symptoms and death from this disease. Because treatment options for patients with severe COVID-19 related pulmonary symptoms remain limited, whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy is being evaluated as an anti-inflammatory modality. However, there is concern about the long-term risks associated with low-dose pulmonary irradiation. To help quantify the benefit-risk balance of low-dose radiation therapy for COVID-19, we estimated radiation-induced lifetime risks of both lung cancer and heart disease (major coronary events) for patients of different sexes, treated at ages 50 to 85, with and without other relevant risk factors (cigarette smoking and baseline heart disease risk)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: These estimates were generated by combining state-of-the-art radiation risk models for lung cancer and for heart disease together with background lung cancer and heart disease risks and age/sex-dependent survival probabilities for the U.S., POPULATION:, RESULTS: Estimated absolute radiation-induced risks were generally higher for lung cancer compared with major coronary events. The highest estimated lifetime radiation-induced lung cancer risks were approximately 6% for female smokers treated between ages 50 and 60. The highest estimated radiation-induced heart disease risks were approximately 3% for males or females with high heart disease risk factors and treated between ages 50 and 60., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated summed lifetime risk of lung cancer and major coronary events reached up to 9% in patients with high baseline risk factors. Predicted lung cancer and heart disease risks were lowest in older nonsmoking patients and patients with few cardiac risk factors. These long-term risk estimates, along with consideration of possible acute reactions, should be useful in assessing the benefit-risk balance for low-dose radiation therapy to treat severe COVID-19 pulmonary symptoms, and suggest that background risk factors, particularly smoking, should be taken into account in such assessments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led surgical societies to recommend delaying diagnosis and treatment of suspected lung cancer for lesions less than 2 cm. Delaying diagnosis can lead to disease progression, but the impact of this delay on mortality is unknown. The COVID-19 infection rate at which immediate operative risk exceeds benefit is unknown. We sought to model immediate versus delayed surgical resection in a suspicious lung nodule less than 2 cm., METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed, and sensitivity analyses performed. The base case was a 65-year-old male smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presenting for surgical biopsy of a 1.5 to 2 cm lung nodule highly suspicious for cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared immediate surgical resection to delayed resection after 3 months. The likelihood of key outcomes was derived from the literature where available. The outcome was 5-year overall survival., RESULTS: Immediate surgical resection resulted in a similar but slightly higher 5-year overall survival when compared with delayed resection (0.77 versus 0.74) owing to the risk of disease progression. However, if the probability of acquired COVID-19 infection is greater than 13%, delayed resection is favorable (0.74 vs 0.73)., CONCLUSIONS: Immediate surgical biopsy of lung nodules suspicious for cancer in hospitals with low COVID-19 prevalence likely results in improved 5-year survival. However, as the risk of perioperative COVID-19 infection increases above 13%, a delayed approach has similar or improved survival. This balance should be frequently reexamined at each health care facility throughout the curve of the pandemic. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In Japan, dietary habits have greatly changed since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak; we examined factors related to dietary changes. An online cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in November 2020 among 6000 Japanese adults (aged 20-64 years) registered with a research company and gathered data on demographics, socioeconomic factors, medical history, COVID-19 status of the respondent's family and neighbors, fear of COVID-19, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits since the COVID-19 outbreak. To the question "Have you made healthier changes to your dietary habits compared with the dietary habits before the spread of COVID-19 (1 year ago, November 2019)?", 1215 (20.3%), 491 (8.2%), and 4294 (71.6%) participants answered that their dietary habits were healthier, unhealthier, and unchanged, respectively. Healthier and unhealthier dietary habits were associated with greater fear of COVID-19, altered exercise and sleep times, and smoking. Unhealthy habits were positively associated with living alone, decreasing household income, colleagues with COVID-19, stress, and weight loss/gain. Annual household income, changing household income, COVID-19 in friends, health literacy, exercise frequency, weight loss, and starting smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes. The generalizability of these results and strategies to inculcate healthy diets in this "new normal" should be investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high mortality rate, especially in patients with severe illness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the potential predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and three electronic Chinese databases were searched from December 1, 2019 to April 29, 2020. Eligible studies reporting potential predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 were identified. Unadjusted prognostic effect estimates were pooled using the random-effects model if data from at least two studies were available. Adjusted prognostic effect estimates were presented by qualitative analysis., RESULTS: Thirty-six observational studies were identified, of which 27 were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 106 potential risk factors were tested, and the following important predictors were associated with mortality: advanced age, male sex, current smoking status, preexisting comorbidities (especially chronic kidney, respiratory, and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases), symptoms of dyspnea, complications during hospitalization, corticosteroid therapy and a severe condition. Additionally, a series of abnormal laboratory biomarkers of hematologic parameters, hepatorenal function, inflammation, coagulation, and cardiovascular injury were also associated with fatal outcome., CONCLUSION: We identified predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19. These findings could help healthcare providers take appropriate measures and improve clinical outcomes in such patients.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Second-hand smoke is a neglected public health issue. Every year 1.2 million people die due to this exposure. Second-hand smoke is also related to various other diseases like cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, low birth weight, maternal depression, etc. The purpose of this review is to look over various studies and to gain an understanding of existing research about second-hand smoke and its adverse effects. In addition, we tried to identify the barriers behind creating a smoke-free environment at home and successful strategies employed and suggestion given in various studies. A comprehensive search of the recent literature related to Second-hand smoke was undertaken using electronic databases like MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Research gate. Keyword searches were conducted for publications published since 2004 or later on Second-hand smoke exposure in pregnant women. Prevalence of SHS among pregnant women ranged from 24% 92%. Lack of knowledge, absence of comprehensive smoking ban, low status of women was among the main contributing factors. Community awareness and counseling by primary health-care physician was found to be successful strategies. There are various cultural and social barriers behind a smoke-free home for pregnant women. Interventional approaches like focused counseling by primary care physicians can help to overcome this issue. There is a need for behavioral interventions and community awareness to be done in this aspect. Copyright: <c2><a9> 2021 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.

TI  - Is periodontitis associated with the severity of COVID-19?
AU  - Shamsoddin, Erfan
PY  - 2021
AB  - Data sources The national electronic health records of the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in the State of Qatar.Data extraction and synthesis This case-control study included 568 patients from the HMC electronic database for data eliciting from 27 February 2020 to 31 July 2020. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications were considered as cases. Controls were defined as COVID-19 patients without major complications (discharged). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the exposures (periodontitis, demographics and medical conditions) and outcomes (COVID-19 complications). The association was adjusted for possible confounding factors. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for stronger risk factors of the determined complications. The results were reported using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Laboratory data (blood parameters concerning the course of COVID-19) were also compared between the case and control groups. Results The patients were divided into 40 cases and 528 controls. Among the patients with periodontitis, 12.8% (33/258) went through COVID-19 complications, whereas 2.2% (7/310) of those without periodontitis experienced complications. The adjusted OR of patients with periodontitis was 3.67 (95% CI 1.46-9.27) for all COVID-19 complications, 8.81 (95% CI 1.00-77.7) for death, 3.54 (95% CI 1.39-9.05) for intensive care unit admission and 4.57 (95% CI 1.19-17.4) for the need of assisted ventilation. After conducting subgroup analyses for age, diabetes and smoking, periodontitis was still significantly associated with all the outcomes. Laboratory biomarkers (haemoglobin A1c, white blood cells and C-reactive protein) had higher levels in COVID-19 patients with periodontitis than those without periodontal disease. Conclusions This study concluded that periodontitis was significantly associated with higher risks of COVID-19 complications and higher blood marker levels. These results, however, are not of high quality and further research in this regard is required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic sent shockwaves through health services worldwide. Resources were reallocated. Patients with COVID-19 still required instrumented spinal surgery for emergencies. Clinical outcomes for these patients are not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on perioperative morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing emergency instrumented spinal surgery and to determine risk factors for increased morbidity/mortality., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 11 patients who were negative for COVID-19 and 8 patients who were positive for COVID-19 who underwent emergency instrumented spinal surgery in 1 hospital in the United Kingdom during the pandemic peak. Data collection was performed through case note review. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, surgical indication, and preoperative neurologic status. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariable analysis was used to identify risk factors for increased morbidity., RESULTS: There were no mortalities in either treatment group. Four patients positive for COVID-19 (50%) developed a complication compared with 6 (55%) in the COVID-19-negative group (P > 0.05). The commonest complication in both groups was respiratory infection. Three patients positive for COVID-19 (37.5%) required intensive care unit admission, compared with 4 (36%) in the COVID-19-negative group (P > 0.05). The average time between surgery and discharge was 19 and 10 days in COVID-19-positive and -negative groups, respectively (P = 0.02). In the COVID-19 positive group, smoking, abnormal BMI, preoperative oxygen requirement, presence of fever, and oxygen saturations <95% correlated with increased risk of complications., CONCLUSIONS: Emergency instrumented spinal surgery in patients positive for COVID-19 was associated with increased length of hospital stay. There was no difference in occurrence of complications or intensive care unit admission. Risk factors for increased morbidity in patients with COVID-19 included smoking, abnormal BMI, preoperative oxygen requirement, fever and saturations <95%. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) are the largest proportion of leukocytes in adult human blood that perform numerous functions, including phagocytosis, degranulation, generation of reactive oxygen species, and NETosis. Excessive neutrophil activity associates with hyperinflammation and tissue damage during pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and coronavirus disease 2019. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can modulate immune cells, including neutrophils, functions, therefore, nAChR ligands are considered as the potent agents for therapy of inflammation. Earlier it was shown, that about 30% of PMNs from the acute inflammatory site responded to nicotine by calcium spikes. In this study, we studied the generation of calcium spikes in murine granulocytes with different maturity level (evaluated by Gr-1 expression) isolated from bone marrow in response to ligands of nAChRs in control and under chronic nicotine consumption. It was found that nearly 20%-25% cells in the granulocyte population responded to nicotine or selective antagonists of different type of nAChRs (alpha-cobratoxin, GIC, and Vc1.1). We demonstrated that in the control group Ca2+ -mobilizing activity was regulated through alpha7 and alpha9alpha10 nAChRs in immature granulocytes (Gr-1int ), whereas in mature granulocytes (Gr-1hi ) it was regulated through alpha7, alpha3beta2, and alpha9-contained nAChRs. Sensitivity of PMNs to nicotine depended on their maturity level after chronic nicotine consumption. Gr-1int cells responded to nicotine through alpha7 and alpha9-contained nAChRs, while Gr-1hi did not respond to nicotine. Thus, calcium response to nAChR ligands in bone marrow PMNs depends on their maturity level. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 International Federation for Cell Biology.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 has spread to virtually all countries of the world infecting millions of people, the medical burden of this disease obviously being enormous. The gonads of both sexes are among the organs that may be affected by COVID-19 and/or may affect the severity of the disease. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection clearly differs between genders. The current evidence indicates that the underlying mechanism of such an interaction could be associated with genetic, hormonal, and immunological differences, as well as with gender differences in such habits as smoking and alcohol use. On the other hand, there are controversies as to how and to what extent the gonads could be affected by COVID-19, possibly impacting upon sex steroids, fertility, and other functions. This review underlines the possible mechanisms that could clarify these questions concerning COVID-19 and the gonads. In addition, reference is made to potential new treatment modalities presently under investigation, these supported by accumulating data published in the recent literature.

AB  - The detrimental effects of tobacco exposure on children's health are well known. Nonetheless, the prevalence of secondhand or direct cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) in the pediatric population has not significantly decreased over time. On the contrary, the rapid incline in use of e-cigarettes among adolescents has evoked public health concerns since increasing cases of vaping-induced acute lung injury have highlighted the potential harm of these new "smoking" devices. Two pediatric populations are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of cigarette smoke. The first group is former premature infants whose risk is elevated both due to their prematurity as well as other risk factors such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation to which they are disproportionately exposed. The second group is children and adolescents with chronic respiratory diseases, in particular asthma and other wheezing disorders. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a spectrum of diseases caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread worldwide over the last year. Here, respiratory symptoms ranging from mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are at the forefront of COVID-19 cases among adults, and cigarette smoking is associated with worse outcomes in this population, and cigarette smoking is associated with worse outcomes in this population. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects children differently in regard to infection susceptibility, disease manifestations, and complications. Although children carry and transmit the virus, the likelihood of symptomatic infection is low, and the rates of hospitalization and death are even lower when compared to the adult population. However, multisystem inflammatory syndrome is recognized as a serious consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. In addition, recent data demonstrate specific clinical patterns in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome vs. severe COVID-19. In this review, we highlight the pulmonary effects of CSE in vulnerable pediatric populations in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - AIM: With the emergence of a new virus and the associated pandemic, the ICU started to see a brand new kind of patient with severe ARD. As with any disease, sometimes the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation for any reason can be difficult. As a center specializing in weaning patients after prolonged mechanical ventilation, we wanted to compare our results with weaning patients who had prolonged mechanical ventilation for other reasons than those of patients who had prolonged mechanical ventilation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: We obtained our data from WeanNet register, the weaning register of the German Institute for Lung Research (ILF). In our analysis, we included only patient data from January until July 2020, which was recorded in our in-house study files., RESULTS: Our analysis included data on 28 patients; 11 were treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 17 had no SARS-CoV-2 infection. 81.2 % of SARS-CoV-2 patients were successfully weaned from invasive ventilator therapy compared to 76.4 % of patients without SARS-CoV-2. Mortality in the SARS-CoV-2 group was 18.2 % compared to 11.8 % in the other group. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were predominantly males with preexisting cardiovascular disease or a history of nicotine abuse. ARDS was the most common cause of respiratory failure which led to primary intubation., CONCLUSION: Even though we were only able to analyze a small number of patient histories due to the novelty of the disease, we were able to show that patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation after SARS-CoV-2 infection can be equally successfully weaned compared to patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation due to other diseases. Risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation after a severe case of SARS-CoV-2 infection seemed to be male gender, nicotine abuse and cardiovascular disease. Copyright Thieme.

AB  - We reviewed surgical cases from 4 Thoracic Surgery departments in the Lombardia region of Italy, the area mostly affected by Coronavirus pandemic in Europe, with the aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of thoracic surgical patients. Clinical, radiological and laboratory data from patients who underwent lung resection from December 2019 to March 2020 were retrospectively collected until June 2020. Univariable Cox regression models were estimated to evaluate potential prognostic factors for developing COVID-19 and to investigate postoperative mortality among patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. We examined data from 107 patients. (74 lobectomies, 32 wedge/segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy). Twelve patients developed COVID-19 (Group 1), whereas 95 patients were not infected (Group 2). In Group 1, 6 patients (50%) died from complications related to infection; in Group 2, one patient (1%) died because of non-COVID-19-related causes. Median days from surgery to first symptoms, CT confirmation, clinical confirmation and PCR positivity was 48.1, 54.3, 55.1, and 55.2 respectively. At univariable analysis, DLCO/VA% (P=0.008), duration of the surgery (P=0.009), smoking history (pack/year) (P < 0.001), BMI (P< 0.001) and number of segments resected (P=0.010) were associated with COVID-19 onset. Moreover, CCI (P < 0.001), DLCO/VA% (P=0.002), cigarette pack/year (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001) and COVID-19 (P < 0.001) were associated with death. Patients who undergo lung resection and then develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory complications and postoperative death. Insidious symptoms' onset may lead to a delay in diagnosis. We suggest two mitigating strategies: (1) Improve symptoms surveillance and isolation during recovery period, (2) Be aware of a potential greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and death correlated with elevated CCI, BMI, smoking history, DLCO/VA%, number of resected segments and duration of surgery.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has modified the cardiovascular care of ambulatory patients. The aim of this survey was to study changes in lifestyle habits, treatment adherence, and mental health status in patients with cardiometabolic disease, but no clinical evidence of COVID-19., Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms., Results: A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3 +/- 15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018). No physical activity was reported by 38% of patients. Only 15% of patients met minimum recommendations of physical activity (more than 150 minutes/week) and vegetable and fruit intake. Low/very low income (45.5%) was associated with a lower level of physical activity (p < 0.0001), less fruit and vegetables intake (p < 0.0001), more tobacco use (p < 0.001) and perception of depression (p < 0.001). Low educational level was also associated with the perception of depression (OR 1.46, CI 1.26-1.70; p < 0.01)., Conclusions: Patients with cardiometabolic disease but without clinical evidence of COVID-19 showed significant medication non-adherence, especially in secondary prevention patients. Deterioration in lifestyle habits and appearance of depressive symptoms during the pandemic were frequent and related to socioeconomic status. Copyright: <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Experimental data highlight the potential benefits and health system cost savings related to surgical prehabilitation; however, adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) data remain nascent. Emerging prehabilitation services may be informed by early RCT data but can be limited in informing real-world program development. Pragmatic trials emphasize external validity and generalizability to understand and advise intervention development and implementation in clinical settings. This paper presents the methodology of a pragmatic prehabilitation trial to complement emerging phase III clinical trials and inform implementation strategies., Methods: This is a pilot pragmatic clinical trial conducted in a large academic hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to assess feasibility of clinical implementation and derive estimates of effectiveness. Feasibility data include program referral rates, enrolment and attrition, intervention adherence and safety, participant satisfaction, and barriers and facilitators to programming. The study aims to receive 150 eligible referrals for adult, English-speaking, preoperative oncology patients with an identified indication for prehabilitation (e.g., frailty, deconditioning, malnutrition, psychological distress). Study participants undergo a baseline assessment and shared-decision making regarding the intervention setting: either facility-based prehabilitation or home-based prehabilitation. In both scenarios, participants receive an individualized exercise prescription, stress-reduction psychological support, nutrition counseling, and protein supplementation, and if appropriate, smoking cessation program referrals. Secondary objectives include estimating intervention effects at the week prior to surgery and 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Outcomes include surgical complications, postoperative length of stay, mortality, hospital readmissions, physical fitness, psychological well-being, and quality of life. Data from participants who decline the intervention but consent for research-related access to health records will serve as comparators. The COVID-19 pandemic required the introduction of a 'virtual program' using only telephone or internet-based communication for screening, assessments, or intervention was introduced., Conclusion: This pragmatic trial will provide evidence on the feasibility and viability of prehabilitation services delivered under usual clinical conditions. Study amendments due to the COVID-19 pandemic are presented as strategies to maintain prehabilitation research and services to potentially mitigate the consequences of extended surgery wait times.

AB  - Lombardy is the Italian region most affected by COVID-19. We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4% vs 13.5%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Communities with more Black or Hispanic residents have higher coronavirus rates than communities with more White residents, but relevant community characteristics are underexplored. The purpose of this study was to investigate poverty-, race- and ethnic-based disparities and associated economic, housing, transit, population health and health care characteristics., METHODS: Six-month cumulative coronavirus incidence and mortality were examined using adjusted negative binomial models among all U.S. counties (n = 3142). County-level independent variables included percentages in poverty and within racial/ethnic groups (Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian), and rates of unemployment, lacking a high school diploma, housing cost burden, single parent households, limited English proficiency, diabetes, obesity, smoking, uninsured, preventable hospitalizations, primary care physicians, hospitals, ICU beds and households that were crowded, in multi-unit buildings or without a vehicle., RESULTS: Counties with higher percentages of Black (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03) or Hispanic (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03) residents had more coronavirus cases. Counties with higher percentages of Black (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.02-1.03) or Native American (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04) residents had more deaths. Higher rates of lacking a high school diploma was associated with higher counts of cases (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) and deaths (IRR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Higher percentages of multi-unit households were associated with higher (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04) and unemployment with lower (IRR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98) incidence. Higher percentages of individuals with limited English proficiency (IRR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.14) and households without a vehicle (IRR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07) were associated with more deaths., CONCLUSIONS: These results document differential pandemic impact in counties with more residents who are Black, Hispanic or Native American, highlighting the roles of residential racial segregation and other forms of discrimination. Factors including economic opportunities, occupational risk, public transit and housing conditions should be addressed in pandemic-related public health strategies to mitigate disparities across counties for the current pandemic and future population health events.

AU  - Saloojee, Yussuf

PY  - 2021
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 plus a temporary ban on the sale of tobacco and vaping products, on smoking cessation in South Africa, by reviewing research surveys conducted while the prohibition was in place., METHOD: An internet search was conducted on 20 August 2020, using the key words: 'South Africa', 'survey', 'poll', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'tobacco", 'vaping', and 'COVID-19'. There were no language restrictions. Additional studies were identified through press reports. Only studies conducted between March and August 2020 were included., RESULTS: Four surveys which reported on smokers quitting behaviour were included. None had been published in a peer reviewed journal. The heterogeneity of the data did not allow pooling. Support for the ban on tobacco sales amongst smokers varied from 6% to 36%. Similarly, there were inconsistent findings about quitting behaviour. Nationally, between 16% to 49% of smokers reported not smoking during the ban., CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking in SA dropped during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, but the estimates were inconsistent, probably because of survey design. There was evidence that the lockdown achieved the fastest rate of decline in smoking prevalence in the country's history. The true extent of the fall though is uncertain. Prevalence studies post lockdown, using probability sampling, may more accurately show how many people quit smoking. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about drastic measures that have significantly altered the norms of daily living. These measures have affected human behaviors in disparate ways. This study seeks to understand the impact of the pandemic on physical activity and dietary behavior among adults living in Kuwait. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 18 June and 15 July 2020, using a questionnaire disseminated through social media, including WhatsApp and Facebook. The target population was individuals aged 21 years or older living in the State of Kuwait. The study included 679 respondents; 57.9% were females, and 67.7% were Kuwaiti nationals. Both genders reported an increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, and carbohydrates, and a decreased consumption of fish and sugary drinks. Compared to males, females reported eating more during the outbreak than their pre-pandemic eating behaviors (32.3% vs. 35.9%, p < 0.05). Approximately one-third of respondents (33.1%) reported performing less than 30 min of physical activity or exercise in a week, and 36.4% of respondents rated their quality of sleep as 'poor' or 'very poor'. The rate of smoking cigarettes among males was significantly higher than in females (40.6% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001). Physical activity was positively correlated with vegetable consumption and quality of sleep. Quality of sleep was negatively correlated with the consumption of sweets and snacks, just as the consumption of vegetables was negatively correlated with the consumption of sugary drinks. The overall negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait necessitates the development of health promotion interventions to support positive physical activity and dietary behaviors using alternative coping strategies among the residents of Kuwait.

AU  - Saieva, Piero

PY  - 2021
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread throughout the world, with devastating effects of the virus as well as the repercussions of the resulting 'lockdowns'. South Africa went into a national lockdown in March 2020 to mitigate the impact of the virus. This included a ban on the sales of tobacco and electronic cigarette products. The ban has been a highly contentious issue in South Africa, discussed worldwide, which has drawn many criticisms. The prevalence rate of smoking in South Africa was around 21.5%, with the Western Cape province having a prevalence rate of 39%. We compared the number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presentations at a large regional referral hospital in the Western Cape province from January to August 2019 with the same period in 2020. Electronic emergency centre data showed a reduction of 69.28% in COPD presentations. To control for some confounders for the same period, we also reviewed patients presenting with urinary tract infections, which showed only a 30.60% reduction. This notable reduction in COPD presentations reduced service pressure of emergency centre and most likely benefitted patients' health. Further research and policies are needed to ensure ongoing reduction in the prevalence of smoking.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, adversely affected all solid-organ transplant processes. Here we share the donor presentations evaluated in a lung transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken at every stage of transplant management, and the outcomes of our transplants., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 15 lung donors selected by the national coordination center pre - sented to our lung transplant center as of March 11, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkey, and data of 5 lung transplant cases in this period were retrospectively analyzed. All donors were examined in detail for COVID-19 disease. Procurement processes for accepted donors, transplant surgeries of recipients, and postoperative follow-up and care processes of recipients were carried out with the least number of personnel, but all with appropriate personal protective equipment., RESULTS: There were 15 donor organs procured by our center during a 9-month period coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of donor pre - sentations to our center between the same dates in the previous year was 78. Five of the 15 donors were accepted, and of those accepted, 4 were male and 1 was female. There was no statistically significant difference between the accepted and rejected donors in terms of the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, age, duration of endotracheal intubation (days), and smoking (pack-years). All SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests performed on bronchoalveolar lavage samples and nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, and rectal samples collected from the recipients during the follow-up period were negative. No pathological finding suggestive of COVID-19 infection was noted in the radiological evaluations., CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant can be successfully managed during the COVID-19 pandemic period, despite the high risk of infection. The major obstacle to the continuity of lung transplant in this period was the limited number of donors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The psychosocial impact of previous infectious disease outbreaks in adults has been well documented, however, there is limited information on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) community. The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children., RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children., CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the psychological impact of COVID-19 among adults and children in the UAE and highlights the significant association between parental and child anxiety. Findings suggest the urgency for policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and especially children.

TI  - Assessing Vaping Views, Usage, and Vaping-Related Education Among Medical Students: A Pilot Study
AU  - Ruppel, Tyler
AU  - Alexander, Brooke

PY  - 2021
AB  - Background E-cigarette use, or vaping, is known to be associated with potentially life-threatening lung injury, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting 2,807 hospitalizations and 68 deaths in the United States due to e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury. Vaping is also a risk factor for and is implicated in the spreading of COVID-19. Despite the consequences of vaping, the views and training of medical students regarding vaping is unclear. This study sought to investigate the knowledge and perception of vaping amongst future health care providers. Methods An anonymous, online survey was administered to 259 first through fourth year medical students at Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine via a secure website link in October 2019 and January 2020. The survey consisted of two sections. All participants answered section one, involving nine questions. This first section addressed sociodemographic characteristics, personal views on vaping, rating and impact of vaping medical education, and whether students had ever tried vaping. If students had ever vaped, they proceeded to section two of the survey including nine additional questions. Students that reported no past vaping use ended the survey and did not proceed to section two. Section two focused on evaluating vaping habits of users by questioning age of first usage, use frequency and nature, reasons for first trying and/or continuing to use, plans for quitting, personal impact of use, and current use. Data was analyzed with frequency and percentage distributions. Results Most respondents were of age 18-25 years (66.8%) and female (60.2%). Almost all students (96.5%) were aware of the negative health consequences of vaping. More than two thirds of students (68.7%) rated their vaping medical education as inadequate and the majority (76.1%) indicated their medical school curriculum did not impact their view on the matter. Most students (71.0%) reported a more negative stance on vaping due to recent news and media. Of the respondents, over two thirds (37.5%) vaped at least once and were labeled "vapers." The most commonly stated reason for first trying vaping was recreational (60.8%). Half of vapers (50.5%) admitted to vaping in the past year and most vapers (90.6%) did not think their vaping impacted others. Current vaping use was reported in almost one-third of vapers (32.3%) despite knowing its dangers, and several (6.3%) did not consider vaping dangerous. Conclusion The findings from this pilot study conducted at a single medical school indicate possible deficiencies in vaping education, at least as perceived by the respondents and demonstrated by their vaping-related actions. It is unknown if the stated vaping views and practices of these medical students would be positively impacted by better vaping education or if these practices are generalizable to other students. However, the data suggests there is a need to consider more extensive analyses of medical school curriculums with respect to vaping education and training of students in these and related areas. Recommendations to enhance medical school curriculums include vaping-focused respiratory and gastrointestinal lectures, problem-based case studies on vaping, standardized patient encounters, and a community education program taught by medical students.

TI  - Looking back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada
AU  - Rotermann, Michelle
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Canadian government legalized non-medical cannabis use by adults in October 2018 to minimize associated harms and redirect profits from criminals. In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December., DATA AND METHODS: Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources., RESULTS: Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020., DISCUSSION: This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.

AB  - Background Observational studies suggest smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and substance use disorders (SUDs) may play a role in the susceptibility for respiratory infections and disease, including coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use. Methods Using genome-wide association study data of European ancestry (data from >1.7 million individuals), we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to evaluate relationships between smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, SUDs, and respiratory infections. Results Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR)=4.039, 95% CI 2.335-6.985, P-value=5.93x10-7) and very severe hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=3.091, 95% CI, 1.883-5.092, P-value=8.40x10-6). Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was also associated with increased risk pneumoniae (OR=1.589, 95% CI, 1.214-2.078, P-value=7.33x10-4), lower respiratory infections (OR=2.303, 95% CI, 1.713-3.097, P-value=3.40x10-8), and several others. Genetically predicted cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with increased bronchitis risk (OR=1.078, 95% CI, 1.020-1.128, P-value=0.007). Conclusions We provide strong genetic evidence showing smoking increases the risk for respiratory infections and diseases even after accounting for other substance use and abuse. Additionally, we provide find CUD may increase the risk for bronchitis, which taken together, may guide future research SUDs and respiratory outcomes.

AB  - During an epidemic period, we compared patients hospitalized for initial suspicion of COVID-19 but for whom an alternative diagnosis was finally retained (n = 152) with those who had COVID-19 (n = 222). Most common diagnoses were another infectious disease and heart failure. COVID-19-negative patients were more often active smokers had less often cough, fever, and digestive symptoms, as compared to the 222 COVID-19-positive patients. They had higher median neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and lower CRP level. In multivariate analysis, no current smoking, neurocognitive disorder, myalgia, and fibrinogen >=4g/L were independently associated with a final diagnosis of COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Smoking history and its potential association with COVID-19 has attracted many researchers and the lay public alike. However, the studies published to date have several methodological limitations and are mainly from China. We set out to synthesize evidence on smoking and COVID-19 relationship drawn on cohort studies only which are published in non-Chinese population settings., Method: A systematic literature search was undertaken drawn on predefined eligibility criteria and a comprehensive search strategy following the PRISMA guideline between January 2020 and August 2020, excluding preprints and gray literature. Three specific outcomes were examined: smoking history, SARS-CoV2 infection, and COVID-19 severity., Results: Of an eligible 40 full-text studies, 7 cohort studies outside of China were finally included in this literature review through independent reviewing. Four studies were from the UK, 2 from the United States, and 1 from Turkey. The sample size ranged from 200 to more than 5000 participants. The findings broadly point to 1 direction, a higher smoking prevalence and an increased risk of smoking history on both SARS-CoV2 infection and on COVID-19 severity., Conclusion: A smoking history (either current or past) seems to negatively impact both SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 severity. However, such an observation strengthens the argument to continue smoking cessation efforts both for individuals and for the general population health and well-being.

AB  - Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) commonly complicates SARS-CoV-2 infection but there is heterogeneity in incidence and mortality in the single center reports and risk factors. Purpose To determine the incidence of PE in COVID-19 and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods Electronic medical records were searched retrospectively for demographic, clinical and laboratory data and outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 at 4 hospitals March-June 2020. PE on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and perfusion scintigraphy was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. D-dimer was used to predict PE and the obtained threshold underwent an external validation on 85 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a 5th hospital. We also assessed the association between right heart strain and embolic burden in patients with PE undergoing echocardiography. Results Four-hundred-thirteen patients with COVID-19 (230 men, aged 20-98 years, mean + SD = 60+16 years) were evaluated. PE was diagnosed in 25% (102/413, 95%CI: 21%-29%) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, undergoing CTPA or perfusion scintigraphy. PE was observed in 29% (21/73, 95%CI:19% -41%) of ICU vs. 24% (81/340, 95%CI:20% -29%) of non-ICU patients (p=0.37). PE was associated with male sex(Odds Ratio=OR[95% CI]: 1.7[1.1-2.8], p=0.02), smoking (OR[95% CI]:1.8[1.01-3.4], p=0.04) and increased d-dimer (p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p=0.02). Mortality in hospitalized patients was similar between those with PE and without PE (14%[13/102, 95%CI: 8% - 22%]vs 13%[40/311, 95%CI: 9% - 17%], p=0.98), suggesting that diagnosis and treatment of PE was not associated with excess mortality. D-dimer>1600 ng/mL predicts PE with 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity in an external validation cohort. Embolic burden was higher in patients with right heart strain among the patients with PE undergoing echocardiogram (p=0.03). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism incidence was 25% in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suspected of PE. D-dimer>1600ng/mL was sensitive for identifying which patients need CTPA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scant data are currently available about a potential link between comorbid chronic lung diseases (CLD) and the risk and severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection., METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD., RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD. Further studies are warranted to determine the risk of COVID-19 for patients with comorbid CLD. Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 SPLF and Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. Understanding smokers' responses to the pandemic will help assess its public health impact and inform future public health and provider messages to smokers., OBJECTIVE: To assess risk perceptions and change in tobacco use among current and former smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in May-July 2020 (55% response rate) PARTICIPANTS: 694 current and former daily smokers (mean age 53, 40% male, 78% white) who had been hospitalized pre-COVID-19 and enrolled into a smoking cessation clinical trial at hospitals in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee., MAIN MEASURES: Perceived risk of COVID-19 due to tobacco use; changes in tobacco consumption and interest in quitting tobacco use; self-reported quitting and relapse since January 2020., KEY RESULTS: 68% (95% CI, 65-72%) of respondents believed that smoking increases the risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a more severe case. In adjusted analyses, perceived risk was higher in Massachusetts where COVID-19 had already surged than in Pennsylvania and Tennessee which were pre-surge during survey administration (AOR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.07-2.28). Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with increased interest in quitting smoking (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.92). During the pandemic, 32% (95% CI, 27-37%) of smokers increased, 37% (95% CI, 33-42%) decreased, and 31% (95% CI, 26-35%) did not change their cigarette consumption. Increased smoking was associated with higher perceived stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.91). Overall, 11% (95% CI, 8-14%) of respondents who smoked in January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) had quit smoking at survey (mean, 6 months later) while 28% (95% CI, 22-34%) of former smokers relapsed. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with higher odds of quitting and lower odds of relapse., CONCLUSIONS: Most smokers believed that smoking increased COVID-19 risk. Smokers' responses to the pandemic varied, with increased smoking related to stress and increased quitting associated with perceived COVID-19 vulnerability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concerns among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients fearing an increased risk of infection and poor outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 among IBD patients; its influence on disease severity and outcome; its relationship to medication use and how the pandemic affected IBD management., METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was posted online to members of the Israel Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Foundation (November 2020-January 2021). The questionnaire addressed the course of IBD disease and COVID-19 infection over the past year., RESULTS: Total 2152 IBD patients completed the questionnaire. Of which 104 (4.8%) had been infected with COVID-19, significantly lower than the 'expected' infected cases among the Israeli population (P = 0.033). The median age of participants was 39 years; 60.5% were female. Most patients (75.6%) had no comorbidities other than IBD. No correlation was found between IBD type or disease severity and COVID-19 infection. Most IBD patients reported mild COVID-19 disease, regardless of the type of IBD medications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, elevated BMI and diabetes were independent risk factors for COVID-19 infection. IBD treatment methods including 5-aminosalicylic acid, smoking and hypertension were protective factors. In total 25.2% of COVID-19 patients discontinued their IBD treatment, compared to 8.5% of non-COVID-19-infected patients. IBD flares were significantly higher in those who discontinued treatment (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients do not have an increased risk for COVID-19, regardless of IBD activity or treatment. Patients should be encouraged to continue effective IBD therapy, including biologics and steroids, to minimize active IBD. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There have been several viral pandemics that have swept the globe over the past century. The latest one is the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this mini review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical presentation, management and prognosis of COVID-19. The pandemic is part of a rapidly changing landscape and it remains to be seen how events will unfold in South Africa, where there is a large reservoir of young people with sub-optimal lung immunity due to several causes, including HIV, post-tuberculous lung disease, smoking, biomass fuel exposure and poor socioeconomic circumstances.

AB  - The COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since December 2019. The pandemic has created tremendous fear of death from infection and awful psychological pressure on healthcare professionals (HCPs). The measures of psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Bangladeshi HCPs are unknown. The present study aimed to assess the mental health outcomes of Bangladeshi HCPs and associated risk factors. We conducted this cross-sectional study from July 15 to September 20, 2020. A total of 355 HCPs aged between 20 and 60 years residing in Bangladesh participated in this study. All the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire through Google Forms consisting of socio-demographic characteristics and mental health outcomes. We measure loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance using the UCLA loneliness scale-8, patient health questionnaire-9, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index. The present study observed the prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among HCPs were 89%, 44%, 78%, and 87%, respectively. The factors significantly associated with the development of mental health problems among HCPs were working environment, economic condition, education level, area of residence, marital status, gender differences, professional category, body mass index, and smoking habit. Moreover, we have seen significant correlations among the different mental health outcomes. In Bangladesh, a large portion of HCPs reported mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic incredibly impacted the psychological health of Bangladeshi healthcare professionals. Appropriate supportive programs and interventional initiatives might help the HCPs with mental health problems during and after this pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors., RESULTS: OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95% CI 2.76 - 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Tobacco smoking is associated with severe health risks. In 2020, the WHO estimated that 8 million people have died due to smoking. Furthermore, smoking tobacco is a well-known risk factor for various infectious pulmonary diseases. The question raised, whether smoking is facilitating SARS-CoV-2-infections and increases adverse outcomes of COVID-19. To answer these questions a narrative review was conducted, finally including 7 systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in January and February 2021. Tobacco smoking was associated with an increased COVID-19 disease severity (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.55-2.19 and former vs. never smokers 1.20-2.48) and an increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.35-1.51 and former vs. never smokers 1.26-2.58). Beside immediate pulmonary toxic effects through active smoking, the cumulative livelong tobacco exposition and subsequent tobacco-associated diseases seem to predominantly predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data regarding an increased risk of infection among smokers is conflicting. However, a large observational study from England with 2.4 million persons reported an association between tobacco smoking and typical symptoms of COVID-19. For e-cigarettes and vaping less data exist, but experimental and first clinical investigations also suggest an increased risk for adverse outcomes for their use and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with limited therapeutic options it is particularly important to advise smokers of their increased risks for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Evidence based support for smoking cessation should be offered. In Germany, the existing and well-established methods to support tobacco cessation need to be reimbursed by statutory health insurances. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Anosmia is a common debilitating symptom of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia., METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group., RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23-37). Among them, 198 (71.7%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8%) of participants. In this study, 83% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8-18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14; P = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia. Further clinical trials, which take these covariates into account, will need to be undertaken. The trail has been registered at ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT04569825. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although parosmia is a common problem in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies assessed the demographic and clinical aspects of this debilitating symptom. We aimed to evaluate the socio-clinical characteristics and outcome of various options of treatment of individuals with parosmia due to COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at two main Hospitals in the Ramadi and Tikrit cities, Iraq, on patients with a chief complaint of parosmia due to COVID-19 disease. The study involved 7 months (August 2020-February 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5%) females. The majority were from age group <= 30 years (n = 188, 70.1%), housewives (n = 150, 56%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9%) or hyposmia (10.1%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7%). Around 3 quarters of the cases were presented in <= 4 months. Altered quality of life (AQL) was presented in 91.8% of subjects, and there was a significant association with the presence of dysgeusia and type and severity of parosmia. The smoking habit didn't show a significant association with AQL, the severity of parosmia, and the recovery rate. Most of the odor group was the most triggering stimuli eliciting parosmia, while, the sewage was the response odor in above 50% of the cases. The recovery rate was poor with olfactory training plus either tonics or local and systemic steroids. Parosmia due to COVID-19 infection is a common problem with poor results in the short-term treatment and follow-up. The AQL was seen in a greater proportion of patients and strongly associated with the presence of dysgeusia, type, and severity of parosmia.

AB  - It has been more than a year since the new virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China. The disease it causes was named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and on 11 March 2020 it was declared a pandemic. As the virus continues to spread, the number of patients worldwide has already crossed the 100 million mark with more than 2 million deaths. We sought to provide an update on the progress made in identifying the virus, its pathophysiology, risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, as well as various methods of treatment. Our review also provided an overview of the different vaccines. Copyright: <c2><a9> 2021 Termedia & Banach.

AB  - Burden due to infectious and noncommunicable disease is increasing at an alarming rate. Social media usage is growing rapidly and has become the new norm of communication. It is imperative to examine what is being discussed in the social media about diseases or conditions and the characteristics of the network of people involved in discussion. The objective is to assess the tools and techniques used to study social media disease networks using network analysis and network modeling. PubMed and IEEEXplore were searched from 2009 to 2020 and included 30 studies after screening and analysis. Twitter, QuitNet, and disease-specific online forums were widely used to study communications on various health conditions. Most of the studies have performed content analysis and network analysis, whereas network modeling has been done in six studies. Posts on cancer, COVID-19, and smoking have been widely studied. Tools and techniques used for network analysis are listed. Health-related social media data can be leveraged for network analysis. Network modeling technique would help to identify the structural factors associated with the affiliation of the disease networks, which is scarcely utilized. This will help public health professionals to tailor targeted interventions.

AB  - AIMS: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the suspension of centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) and has underscored the need for home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HBCTR) as a feasible alternative rehabilitation delivery model. Yet, the effectiveness of HBCTR as an alternative to Phase 2 CBCR is unknown. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively appraise the effectiveness of HBCTR., METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to January 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HBCTR to Phase 2 CBCR or usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Out of 1588 studies, 14 RCTs involving 2869 CHD patients were included in this review. When compared with usual care, participation in HBCTR showed significant improvement in functional capacity {6-min walking test distance [mean difference (MD) 25.58 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.74-36.42]}; daily step count (MD 1.05 K, 95% CI 0.36-1.75) and exercise habits [odds ratio (OR) 2.28, 95% CI 1.30-4.00)]; depression scores (standardized MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.01) and quality of life [Short-Form mental component summary (MD 2.63, 95% CI 0.06-5.20) and physical component summary (MD 1.99, 95% CI 0.83-3.16)]. Effects on medication adherence were synthesized narratively. HBCTR and CBCR were comparably effective., CONCLUSION: In patients with CHD, HBCTR was associated with an increase in functional capacity, physical activity (PA) behaviour, and depression when compared with UC. When HBCTR was compared to CBCR, an equivalent effect on functional capacity, PA behaviour, QoL, medication adherence, smoking behaviour, physiological risk factors, depression, and cardiac-related hospitalization was observed.

AB  - Background: The recent global inclination for smoking during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drawn attention to the impact of smoking on COVID-19. While smoking increases susceptibility to common respiratory pathogens including the closely related coronaviruses, COVID-19 causing Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) being a respiratory pathogen intrigues the possible association between smoking and viral pathogenicity., Smoking and COVID-19: The gender dependence of COVID-19 infection rates and a higher prevalence of smokers among males made the scientific world assume smoking to be a confounding variable in sex predisposition to COVID-19. Conversely, the controversial findings of discrepant morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 among smokers questioned the credibility of this hypothesis. More importantly, nicotine in smoking has been hypothesized to downregulate Interleukin-6 (IL-6) which plays a role in COVID-19 severity and to interfere with the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 led the scientists to experiment nicotine patch prophylactically against COVID-19. Besides, interaction between spike protein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) supports the nicotinic cholinergic system dysregulation hypothesis in COVID-19 pathophysiology leading to its therapeutic use. However, despite the contradictions in the direct impact of smoking, it surely acts as fomites for viral transmission., Conclusion: Irrespective of the role nicotine in COVID-management, compassionate use of smoking against SARS-CoV-2 cannot be recommended until the therapeutic value gets proved and therapeutic form becomes available.

AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19, a major 'Public Health Emergencies of International Concern,' had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India., METHODS: A self-administered, web-based application study using 'WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20', in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement., KEY FINDINGS: A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (~35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored > 7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress., CONCLUSION: Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects older people. Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute COVID-19. However, these findings may reflect pre-existing cardiac phenotypes., AIMS: We tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phenotypes with incident COVID-19., METHODS: We studied UK Biobank participants with CMR imaging and COVID-19 testing. We considered left and right ventricular (LV, RV) volumes, ejection fractions, and stroke volumes, LV mass, LV strain, native T1, aortic distensibility, and arterial stiffness index. COVID-19 test results were obtained from Public Health England. Co-morbidities were ascertained from self-report and hospital episode statistics (HES). Critical care admission and death were from HES and death register records. We investigated the association of each cardiovascular measure with COVID-19 test result in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and prior myocardial infarction., RESULTS: We studied 310 participants (n = 70 positive). Median age was 63.8 [57.5, 72.1] years; 51.0% (n = 158) were male. 78.7% (n = 244) were tested in hospital, 3.5% (n = 11) required critical care admission, and 6.1% (n = 19) died. In fully adjusted models, smaller LV/RV end-diastolic volumes, smaller LV stroke volume, and poorer global longitudinal strain were associated with significantly higher odds of COVID-19 positivity., DISCUSSION: We demonstrate association of pre-existing adverse CMR phenotypes with greater odds of COVID-19 positivity independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: Observational reports of cardiovascular involvement after COVID-19 may, at least partly, reflect pre-existing cardiac status rather than COVID-19 induced alterations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender-related factors might affect vulnerability to Covid-19. The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients., METHODS: Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization., RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6%) with a mean age of 67.0 +/- 14.5 years (vs 67.8 +/- 12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO2/FiO2 was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134-273] vs 238 mmHg [150-281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7% vs 13.0%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1% in women and 38.1% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687)., CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.

AB  - COVID-19, the global threat to humanity, shares etiological cofactors with multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding the common links between COVID-19 and AD would harness strategizing therapeutic approaches against both. Considering the urgency of formulating COVID-19 medication, its AD association and manifestations have been reviewed here, putting emphasis on memory and learning disruption. COVID-19 and AD share common links with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), galectin-9 (GAL-9 or Gal-9), and APOE4 allele. Common etiological factors and common manifestations described in this review would aid in developing therapeutic strategies for both COVID-19 and AD and thus impact on eradicating the ongoing global threat. Thus, people suffering from COVID-19 or who have come round of it as well as people at risk of developing AD or already suffering from AD, would be benefitted.

AB  - Background: Lockdown measures were implemented in many countries to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such restrictions could precipitate unintended negative consequences on lifestyle behaviors. The main objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unhealthy behavior changes during the COVID-19 lockdown among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey of adults residing in the UAE was carried out during lockdown (n = 2060). Using a multi-component questionnaire, the collected data included questions regarding the following lifestyle changes: Increased dietary intake, increased weight, decreased physical activity, decreased sleep, and increased smoking. An unhealthy lifestyle change score was calculated based on the number of unhealthy lifestyle changes each participant reported. In addition, sociodemographic and living conditions information was collected. Descriptive statistics as well as simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the prevalence and determinants of the unhealthy lifestyle changes considered in this study. Results: Among the unhealthy lifestyle changes examined, increased food intake was the most common (31.8%), followed by decreased physical activity (30%), increased weight (29.4%), decreased sleep (20.8%), and increased smoking (21%). In addition to identifying the correlates of each of the aforementioned lifestyle changes, the results of the multiple regression linear analyses revealed the following correlates for the overall unhealthy lifestyle change score: females (beta = 0.32, CI: 0.22; 0.42), living in an apartment (beta = 0.12, CI: 0.003; 0.23) and being overweight/obese (beta = 0.24, CI: 0.15; 0.32) had higher scores, while older adults (>40 years) had lower scores (beta = -0.23, CI: -0.34; -0.12). Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and practices among UAE residents. The findings of this study provided the evidence base for officials to design interventions targeting high-risk groups and aiming to improve healthy lifestyle factors among residents during the pandemic.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of high mortality among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This study aimed at determining the association between presence of chronic diseases and smoking behaviors with the development of ARDS among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah-affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify whether the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage is higher in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we compared the risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 and those without COVID-19., METHODS: We analyzed the data from the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 data set derived from 62 health care facilities. The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19., RESULTS: There were a total of 154 (0.2%) and 667 (0.3%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.6; p < .0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.4% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), acute kidney injury (48.7% versus 31.0%; p < .0001), acute myocardial infarction (11% versus 6.4%; p = .048), sepsis (41.6% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), and respiratory failure (61.7% versus 42.3%; p < .0001) were significantly higher among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with that among those without COVID-19 (40.3% versus 19.0%; p < .0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that rates of intracerebral hemorrhage are higher in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of comorbidities and adverse in-hospital events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A better understanding of re-infection after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become one of the healthcare priorities in the current pandemic. We determined the rate of re-infection, associated factors and mortality during follow up in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: We analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in United States between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Re-infection was defined by two positive tests separated by interval of greater than 90 days two after resolution of first infection was confirmed by two or more consecutive negative tests. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with re-infection., RESULTS: Re-infection was identified in 0.7% (n=63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5%-0.9%) during follow up of 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean period (+/-standard deviation [SD]) between two positive tests was 116 +/- 21 days. A logistic regression analysis identified that asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2) and nicotine dependence/tobacco use (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6-4.5) were associated with re-infection. There was a significantly lower rate of pneumonia, heart failure, and acute kidney injury observed with re-infection compared with primary infection among the 63 patients with re-infection There were two deaths (3.2%) associated with re-infection., CONCLUSIONS: We identified a low rate of re-infection confirmed by laboratory tests in a large cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although re-infection appeared to be milder than primary infection, there was associated mortality. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage (including subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH]) has been reported in 0.3%-1.2% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no study has evaluated the risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We analyzed data from 62 health care facilities using the Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset., RESULTS: There were 86 (0.1%) and 376 (0.2%) patients with SAH among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of SAH in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4-0.7, P < 0.0001) after adjusting for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and nicotine dependence/tobacco use. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.1% vs. 21.3%, P < 0.0001), acute kidney injury (43% vs. 27.7%, P = 0.0005), septic shock (44.2% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.0001), and respiratory failure (64.0% vs. 39.1%, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher among patients with SAH and COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with SAH and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with patients without COVID-19 (31.4% vs. 12.2%, P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SAH was not increased in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with SAH and COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of systemic comorbidities. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) underlined the urgent need for alleviating cytokine storm. We propose here that activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is a potential therapeutic strategy. However, there is currently no approved drugs targeting the regulatory pathway. It is evident that nicotine, anisodamine and some herb medicine, activate the CAP and exert anti-inflammation action in vitro and in vivo. As the vagus nerve affects both inflammation and specific immune response, we propose that vagus nerve stimulation by invasive or non-invasive devices and acupuncture at ST36, PC6, or GV20, are also feasible approaches to activate the CAP and control COVID-19. It is worth to investigate the efficacy and safety of the strategy in patients with COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Qin, Xiang, Su, Sun and Liu.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of COVID-19 disease are variable. Multiple Factors can affect the disease progression and outcome., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of COVID-19 in Jordan., METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were collected for 557 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Prince Hamzah Hospital (PHH), Jordan. Analysis was performed using appropriate statistical tests with SPSS version 24., RESULTS: Of the 557 COVID-19 PCR-positive cases admitted to PHH, the mean age was 34.4+/-18.95 (5 weeks to 87 years), 86% were males, 41.4% were blood group A+, and 57% were overweight or obese. Significant past medical history was documented in 25.9%, significant surgical history in 12.7%, current smoking in 15.0%, and pregnancy in 0.5%. The mean duration of hospitalization was 16.3+/-9.2 (5 to 70) days. 53% were asymptomatic, 13% had more than 5 symptoms, with generalized malaise and dry cough the most common symptoms. Only 2.8% had a respiratory rate over 25 breaths/min, and 2% had an oxygen saturation below 85%. Laboratory investigations showed a wide range of abnormalities with lymphocytosis and elevated CRP, ESR, and D-Dimer the most common abnormalities. Ground glass opacity was the most common imaging finding. Males had a significantly higher frequency of symptoms, incidence of smoking, reduced hemoglobin, increased monocyte %, elevated creatinine levels, and ICU admissions compared to females (P < 0.05). Hospitalization duration was associated with increased age, male gender, symptom score, history of smoking, elevated systolic blood pressure, elevated respiratory rate, and elevated monocyte %, CRP, ESR, creatinine, and D-dimer (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 cases admitted to PHH were asymptomatic. Variabilities in symptoms, signs, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be noted. Increased age, male gender, smoking history, and elevated inflammatory markers were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalization., CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - RATIONALE: The association between smoking status and severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial., OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hospitalization (as a marker of severe COVID-19) in patients by smoking status: former, current and never smokers, who tested positive for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) at an academic medical center in the United States., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status., RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers; 7.3% current smokers; 10.4% never smokers, p<0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A significant proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 report a new onset of smell or taste loss. The duration of the chemosensory impairment and predictive factors of recovery are still unclear. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, temporal course and recovery predictors in patients who suffered from varying disease severity. Consecutive adult patients diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reference Hospitals were contacted to complete a survey reporting chemosensory loss, severity, timing and duration, nasal symptoms, smoking, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. In a cross-sectional study, we contacted 182 patients and 150 responded. Excluding the critically ill patients, 38% reported gustatory and 41% olfactory impairment (74% severe/anosmia). Most of the patients (88%) recovered their sense of smell by two months (median: 11.5 days; IQR: 13.3). For 23%, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. There were no significant differences in the prevalence and duration of chemosensory loss between groups of varying COVID-19 severity, and sexes (all p > 0.05). Moderate hyposmia resolved quicker than more severe loss (p = 0.04). Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent in COVID-19. Most patients recover fast, but nearly one out of ten have not recovered in two months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported a low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 cases; however, no definitive conclusions can be drawn., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of tobacco smoke exposure with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity accounting for possible confounders., METHODS: The nationwide, self-administered, cross-sectional web-based Italian National Epidemiological Survey on COVID-19 (EPICOVID19) was administered to an Italian population of 198,822 adult volunteers who filled in an online questionnaire between April 13 and June 2, 2020. For this study, we analyzed 6857 individuals with known NPS test results. The associations of smoking status and the dose-response relationship with a positive NPS test result and infection severity were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs by means of logistic and multinomial regression models adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics., RESULTS: Out of the 6857 individuals (mean age 47.9 years, SD 14.1; 4516/6857, 65.9% female), 63.2% (4334/6857) had never smoked, 21.3% (1463/6857) were former smokers, and 15.5% (1060/6857) were current smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, current smokers were younger, were more educated, were less affected by chronic diseases, reported COVID-19-like symptoms less frequently, were less frequently hospitalized, and less frequently tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, current smokers had almost half the odds of a positive NPS test result (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to nonsmokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate smokers (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), and heavy smokers (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53). This inverse association also persisted when considering the severity of the infection. Current smokers had a statistically significantly lower probability of having asymptomatic (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), mild (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.81), and severe infections (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) compared to those who never smoked., CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-dependent relationship. Ad hoc experimental studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04471701; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04471701.

We aim to examine association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality., Methods: This was a prospective study with participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Participants who lived in England were followed up from 01/02/2020 to 28/06/2020 with data linked to hospital episode statistics, Office for National Statistics and Public Health England PCR tests. We compared current-smokers, previous-smokers with never-smokers and estimated risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality using Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index and socio-economic status. Interactions between smoking status and age and sex were tested for using multiplicative interactions, and analyses were stratified by median age (49-68 years, 69-86 years) and sex., Results: In total, 402,978 participants were included in the analyses. The majority were never smokers, 226,294 (56.2%), 140,090 (34.8%) were previous smokers, and 39,974 (9.9%) current smokers. COVID-19 infection was identified in 1591 (0.39%) people, and 372/1591 (23.4%) died. Amongst the younger participants, smokers were nearly twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19 than never smokers (RR 1.88 [1.49-2.38]) whereas there was no difference for those aged 69+ (RR 1.05 [0.82-1.34]). In contrast, amongst the older participants, smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-smokers (RR 2.15 [1.11-4.16]) whereas there was no difference for those under the age of 69 (RR 1.22[0.83-1.79]). Similar patterns were observed for previous smokers. The impact of smoking was similar in men and women., Conclusion: The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent death is modified by age. Smokers and previous smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with increased exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus. Once infected, older smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than never smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of chronic conditions/illnesses.

AB  - E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a respiratory illness that has significant overlap with the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current pandemic, diagnosis of EVALI may be delayed because of anchoring bias when patients present with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. We present 3 cases of patients who were hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 but were later diagnosed with EVALI. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Authors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health authorities are advising smokers to quit to reduce their COVID-related risk. The types of messages that may be effective in alerting smokers to this risk and encouraging a quit attempt are unknown. The aim of this study was to test a series of messages to identify potentially effective communication approaches., METHODS: An online survey was completed by 1509 smokers across three countries (Australia: n = 604; New Zealand: n = 304; United Kingdom: n = 601) in April-May 2020. Respondents were randomly assigned to view just one of four quit messages, two of which explicitly referred to the coronavirus, one referred to risk of chest infection, and one encouraged cessation for financial reasons. Outcome variables included quit intentions, further information seeking, message perceptions, and health and financial concerns., RESULTS: All four messages were associated with significant differences in the proportions of respondents intending to quit within the following 2 wk (increase range: 11%-34%) and with substantial proportions of respondents electing to access additional information (range: 37%-50%). The differences in intentions were significantly larger for the two health-related messages that specifically mentioned the coronavirus. All messages were perceived favorably in terms of acceptability, believability, effectiveness, and personal relevance. Negligible differences in health and financial concerns were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom appear likely to be receptive to messages about their COVID-related risk. Such messages have the potential to increase quit intentions and prompt information-seeking behaviors., IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an opportunity to encourage smokers to quit to reduce both their COVID-related risks and their risks of a broad range of noncommunicable diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Care facilities are particularly challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides others this includes human and structural resources., OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study evaluated the occurrence of infections, psychosocial stress and the different strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic in care facilities., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data collection took place in 7 care facilities in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany between 17 July and 25 August 2020. This included a SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing and a questionnaire for residents and staff. Care facilities were questioned on interventions and preventive measures taken., RESULTS: Out of 829 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests all remained negative. Only 2 asymptomatic subjects had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All subjects (n= 6) with a history of positive PCR had no detectable antibodies. Healthcare workers were mainly worried about infecting family, friends and especially residents (54.4%) with less fear to infect themselves (27.2%). Individual stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: 17.1% exhaustion, 16% financial burden and 13.1% sleeping disorders. Coping strategies included a moderate increase of harmful behavior (+3.3% alcohol, +4.3% nicotine). This was relevantly more important in staff aged under 35 years (+13% alcohol, +12.7% nicotine). Women reported a 2.4% increased use of medication, 49.8% of respondents reduced their social contacts, 76.8% changed their individual hygiene behavior. Care facilities felt prepared to a limited extent for the challenges faced by the pandemic., CONCLUSION: Even with a low prevalence of infections at the time of the survey the COVID-19 pandemic challenged care facilities at multiple levels. This should result in better preventive management and coping strategies. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cigarette smoking has been proven to be a risk factor in the development of many diseases. However, it remains controversial with respect to the relationship of smoking with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of smoking in COVID-19., Methods: A total of 622 patients with COVID-19 in China were enrolled in the study. Corresponding clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were employed to analyze the association of smoking with survival in patients with COVID-19., Results: Smoking was statistically significant comparing non-survivors and survivors of patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.007). Males had higher proportion of smoking than females (91.9% vs. 8.1%, P < 0.001). Compared with the non-smoker, there was significant statistical difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in smoking patients with COVID-19 (9.7% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.017). White blood cell count (6.3 vs. 5.4; P = 0.037), hemoglobin level (139.0 vs. 127.0; P < 0.001), and creatinine level (77.3 vs. 61.0; P < 0.001) were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients who smoked. Moreover, smoking patients showed a worse survival compared with non-smoking patients (Log Rank P = 0.045). After adjustment for age, gender and underlying diseases, patients with smoking still had higher risk of mortality than that of non-smoking patients (hazard ratio[HR] 1.897, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.058-3.402, P = 0.032)., Conclusion: Smoking was thought to be a risk factor in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 and smoking patients might have a higher risk of mortality than that of the non-smoking patients.

AB  - Smoking rates are higher for people who use mental health services, which contributes substantially to health inequalities. Smoking can lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes, yet it remains unclear whether smoking has changed for people who use mental health services. We examined smoking patterns in a large clinical cohort of people with severe mental illness, before and during the pandemic. We found high levels of nicotine dependence and heavier patterns of smoking. Although some people had reported quitting, it is likely that smoking inequalities have become further entrenched. Mental health services should seek to mitigate this modifiable risk and source of poor health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these two groups., METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care (Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre Case Mix Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status; and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index, deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported information on types and duration of organ support for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups., FINDINGS: The primary care cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 117 926 (59.4%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0.4%) were admitted to CCU, and 899 (0.4%) died within 28 days. The critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of these, 2685 (62.8%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15.5%) died at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.15 (95% CI 1.75-2.65) for CCU admission and 1.65 (1.36-2.01) for 28-day mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0.91 (0.76-1.09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with those with non-B.1.1.7 infection., INTERPRETATION: Patients with lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and 28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and infection with COVID-19., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the Medical Sciences Division of the University of Oxford.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chalazia are common inflammatory eyelid lesions, but their epidemiology remains understudied. This retrospective case-control study examined the prevalence, risk factors and geographic distribution of chalazia in a large veteran population., METHODS: Data on all individuals seen at a Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic between October 2010 and October 2015 were extracted from the VA health database. Subjects were grouped based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for chalazion. Univariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with chalazion presence, followed by multivariable modelling to examine which factors predicted risk concomitantly. All cases were mapped across the continental US using geographic information systems modelling to examine how prevalence rates varied geographically., RESULTS: Overall, 208 720 of 3 453 944 (6.04%) subjects were diagnosed with chalazion during the study period. Prevalence was highest in coastal regions. The mean age of the population was 69.32+/-13.9 years and most patients were male (93.47%), white (77.13%) and non-Hispanic (93.72%). Factors associated with chalazion risk included smoking (OR=1.12, p<0.0005), conditions of the tear film (blepharitis (OR=4.84, p<0.0005), conjunctivitis (OR=2.78, p<0.0005), dry eye (OR=3.0, p<0.0005)), conditions affecting periocular skin (eyelid dermatitis (OR=2.95, p<0.0005), rosacea (OR=2.50, p<0.0005)), allergic conditions (history of allergies (OR=1.56, p<0.0005)) and systemic disorders (gastritis (OR=1.54, p<0.0005), irritable bowel syndrome (OR=1.45, p<0.0005), depression (OR=1.35, p<0.0005), anxiety (OR=1.31, p<0.0005)). These factors remained associated with chalazion risk when examined concomitantly., CONCLUSION: Periocular skin, eyelid margin and tear film abnormalities were most strongly associated with risk for chalazion. The impact of environmental conditions on risk for chalazion represents an area in need of further study. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use.

AB  - Cancer patients are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections due to frequent contacts with the healthcare system, immunocompromised state from cancer or its therapies, supportive medications such as steroids and most importantly their advanced age and comorbidities. Patients with lung cancer have consistently been reported to suffer from an increased risk of death compared with other cancers. This is possibly due to the combination of specific pathophysiological aspects, including underlying pulmonary compromise due to smoking history and the increased specific pressures on respiratory healthcare services caused by the related pandemic. Rationally and safely treating patients with lung cancer during the pandemic has become a continuous challenge over the last year. Deciding whether to offer, modify, postpone or even cancel treatments for this particular patient's population has become the crucial recurrent dilemma for lung cancer professionals. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted agents represent distinct risks factors in the context of COVID-19 that should be balanced with the short-term and long-term consequences of delaying cancer care. Despite the rapid and persistent trend of the pandemic, declared by WHO on March 11, 2020, and still ongoing at the time of writing (January 2021), various efforts were made by oncologists worldwide to understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Adapted recommendations of our evidence-based practice guidelines have been developed for all stakeholders. Different small and large-scale registries, such as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration quickly collected data, supporting cancer care decisions under the challenging circumstance created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several recommendations were developed as guidance for prioritizing the various aspects of lung cancer care in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality of our patients from COVID-19 and from cancer. These recommendations helped inform decisions about treatment of established disease, continuation of clinical research and lung cancer screening. In this review, we summarize available evidence regarding the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and patients.

AB  - The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems and the physical and mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been substantial. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of mental health workers who provide care to a vulnerable patient population that have been particularly affected during this crisis. A total of 387 HCWs from across a large urban mental health service completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic, lifestyle and work-based information and validated psychometric scales. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively; sleep problems with the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); and resilience with the Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential mediating factors. Prevalence of burnout was notable, with 52% recording moderate/severe in Emotional Exhaustion, 19.5% moderate/severe in Depersonalisation, and 55.5% low/moderate Personal Accomplishment. Over half of all respondents (52%) experienced sleep problems; the presence of depressive symptoms was a significant predictor of insomnia. An increase in potentially harmful lifestyle changes, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and overeating was also observed. However, high Resilience was reported by 70% of the samples and the importance of this is highlighted. Female gender was associated with increased levels of depression and emotional exhaustion while those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk of affective symptoms, insomnia, and burnout. Overall, our study revealed considerable levels of psychological distress and maladaptive coping strategies but also resilience and satisfaction with organizational support provided. Findings can inform tailored interventions in order to mitigate vulnerability and prevent long-term psychological sequelae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Guided by accounts of adjustment in daily life as a key indicator of health, the current study examined prospective changes in young adults' emotions and substance behaviors assessed during a normative baseline period and during the acute COVID-19 disruption period in late March/early April 2020. The COVID-19 assessment also collected psychosocial risk factors expected to moderate changes in adjustment across time., METHOD: Participants included 295 young adults (70.8% female; ages 18-21 at baseline), drawn from an ongoing study of daily behaviors and health in college life that oversampled for recent substance behaviors, who completed both the baseline and COVID-19 assessments. Hypotheses were tested using analyses of repeated-measures data that included covariates of length of time between assessments and sampling group status., RESULTS: Direct tests in support of hypotheses indicated an increase in negative affect (d = .67, p < .001), and greater alcohol use (d = .75, p < .001) and marijuana use (d = .58, p < .001), in daily life across time. Levels of positive affect (d = .08, p > .05), nicotine use (d = .01, p > .05), and prescription drug misuse (d = .003, p > .05) did not reliably change in tests of direct models. Moderation tests indicated several risk factors for experiencing steeper increases in negative affect, and increased likelihood of marijuana and nicotine use, in daily life across time., CONCLUSIONS: Findings offer implications for future research and clinical efforts to improve young adult adjustment in response to the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As we move towards a post-pandemic society, a question arises: How will the way we live look different in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic?, AIM: The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in eating habits and other lifestyle behaviours (i.e., exercise and smoking) of people of almost all ages, who live in Greece, during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: A web-based survey using conventional sampling was conducted from during December 2020, in Greece. A total of 2258 individuals, aged 17 years and older voluntarily participated (912 (40%) men)., RESULTS: 89 (3.94%) of the participants reported that they had, or currently have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Moreover, 36.4% of the participants reported that they have changed their dietary habits during the pandemic towards a healthier diet - those participants had median age of 35 years, were of both sexes, 17% had co-morbidities and 69% with higher education level; moreover, 19% of those participants have started or increased the frequency of receiving dietary supplements that enhance the immune system, 34% of the participants reported that they gained weight during the pandemic period, whereas 19.8% reported that they have lost weight, and 37% of the participants reported that they have started or increased, as compared to the pre-pandemic time, their frequency of physical activities., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19_pandemic seems to have forced people to discover again habits and traditions towards a more natural and healthier way of living. Long-term consequences and the evolution of these lifestyle changes after the COVID-19 pandemic have to be evaluated relevant to their implications in public health.

AB  - Lockdowns to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 have disrupted routines and behaviors, which could lead to a worsening of lifestyle and an increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases. This study aimed to describe the changes in physical activity, diet, alcohol drinking, and cigarette smoking during lockdown. A self-administered online survey addressing adults living in a province in northern Italy was advertised through websites and social media. Citizens could access the survey in anonymity from 4 May until 15 June 2020. A total of 1826 adults completed the survey, with a worsening of physical activity (35.1%), diet (17.6%), alcohol drinking (12.5%), and cigarette smoking (7.7%) reported. In contrast, 33.5% reported an improvement in diet, 12.6% in alcohol drinking, 5.3% in physical activity and 4.1% in cigarette smoking. Female sex, young adult age, suspension of work activity, and symptoms of psychological distress were the factors associated with a greater likelihood of change, which was frequently for the worse. Lockdown had an impact on lifestyle, with some net beneficial effects on diet and mostly negative effects on physical activity. Public health measures should be implemented to avoid long-term negative effects of the lockdown, supporting individuals more prone to change for the worse.

AB  - AIMS: Maternal mental distress in pregnancy can be damaging to the mother's and child's physical and mental health. This study aimed to provide an insight into mental well-being of pregnant women in Denmark during COVID-19 by assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety., METHODS: Data from two cohorts of pregnant women recruited from Danish general practice were compared. A COVID-19 lockdown cohort (N=330) completed questionnaires between 8 April and 6 May. Responses were compared to those from a control cohort of women from 2016 (N=1428). Mental well-being was measured with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Anxiety Symptom Scale (ASS)., RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 83% of the COVID-19 lockdown cohort and by 93% of the control cohort. Multivariable analysis controlling for age, cohabitation status, occupation, smoking, alcohol use, chronic disease, fertility treatment, parity and children living at home showed no difference in depressive symptoms (MDI). Anxiety symptoms (ASS) were slightly worse in the COVID-19 lockdown cohort (mean difference=1.4 points), mainly driven by questions concerning general anxiety. The largest differences in anxiety were seen in first trimester (adjusted mean difference=4.0 points)., CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women questioned during the COVID-19 pandemic showed no change in symptoms of depression and only a modest elevation of anxiety when compared to pregnant women questioned during a non-pandemic period in 2016.

AB  - Background: In order to find out the factors associated with the large disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates by country, we conducted an ecological study by linking existing statistics. In Japan, a large variation was observed in between geographical areas when assessing mortality. We performed a regional correlation analysis to find factors related to regional mortality., Methods: This study design was an ecologic study. A multiple regression analysis was performed with COVID-19 mortality rates of different countries as the dependent variable together with various health care and economic factors. We calculated the cumulative mortality rate as of June 30, 2020. For the regional correlation analysis of Japan, 47 prefectures were divided into nine regions. The factors examined were health care and tourism. Data for 33 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were analyzed. In Japan's regional analysis, the whole country was classified into nine regions., Results: Factors related to mortality were the incidence of Kawasaki disease (KD), number of computed tomographies (CTs), and alcohol consumption. Mortality was low in countries with high incidence of KD and high number of CTs, as well as in countries with high alcohol consumption. In European countries, high smoking prevalence and a high Gini coefficient were positively related to high mortality. According to a regional analysis in Japan, mortality was related to proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts, the number of foreign visitors per capita, and the number of Chinese visitors per capita., Conclusion: Low mortality in East Asia was associated with specific disease morbidity (KD), alcohol consumption, and CT numbers. It was suggested that the mortality gap in Japan was related to the number of foreign tourists and the proportion of population in the densely inhabited districts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward the COVID -19 vaccine, which has been introduced to healthcare professionals at the beginning of 2021 and give information to them on the disease and vaccine. This cross-sectional analytical study has been performed by conducting an online survey to the healthcare professionals who work at the healthcare institutions in the province of Samsun in Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. In addition to sixteen questions about the demographic characteristics, the "Attitudes towards the COVID -19 vaccine" scale has been used. MANOVA test and Spearman rho correlation coefficient were used in analytical examinations. A total of 1426 healthcare professional have been reached. 64.3% of participants were female, 44.1% were nurse/midwife and 66.6% were public employees. Regarding the questions in the sub-dimension of positive attitude, the rate of response of "I agree/I strongly agree" was between 40.6% and 54.6%. Positive attitude mean values differ according to gender, age, institution, presence of children, smoking status, being a relative who died due to COVID -19, and profession (respectively p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p = .002, p = .019, p < .001). It has been observed that positive and negative attitudes toward COVID -19 vaccination are almost equally distributed and some demographic factors affect the attitude. The opinions of healthcare professionals on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, which are the main elements of the vaccination effort, may affect the public perception of vaccination.

AB  - A 78-year-old Japanese woman with no smoking history suffered from near-fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring four-week invasive mechanical ventilation, with subsequent radiological features of pulmonary fibrosis. Although methylprednisolone gradually improved her respiratory condition, her oxygenation and exercise tolerance had drastically deteriorated, necessitating high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. In parallel with tapering systemic steroid, the patient was treated with nintedanib. Three months later, the patient was able to walk with a walking aid using oxygen at 4 L/min. The present case is an indication that nintedanib might provide a novel therapeutic approach for managing post-COVID-19 fibrosis, although further studies are warranted.

Single tertiary referral center-University of California, San Diego. Four patients with various etiologies of acute respiratory distress syndrome, including influenza, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury, and coronavirus disease 2019, complicated by bronchopleural and alveolopleural fistula and chest tubes with air leaks., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bronchopleural and alveolopleural fistula closure and survival to discharge. All four patients were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with ventilator settings even lower than Extracorporeal Life Support Organization guideline recommended ultraprotective lung ventilation. The patients bronchopleural and alveolopleural fistulas closed during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and minimal ventilatory support. All four patients survived to discharge., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopleural and alveolopleural fistula with persistent air leaks, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to allow for even lower ventilator settings than ultraprotective lung ventilation is safe and feasible to mediate bronchopleural and alveolopleural fistula healing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 infected patients has been soaring in the Middle East countries. The disease poses a significant threat, decisions about prioritizing care should be made in accordance with the proven risk factors for complications., OBJECTIVE: The present study provides the first bespoke prediction model in the Middle East to identify COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for complications., METHOD: A case-control study design was adopted to compare the characteristics of successfully recovered patients with those who had complications. Complications were defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, sepsis or septic shock, pneumonia or respiratory failure, and death. The prediction model was created through multivariable logistic regression. Overall statistical significance tests for the model were carried out., RESULTS: All COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients (n = 133) in Amman - Jordan were included in the study. Successfully recovered were 125 patients. The median age (IRQ) was 26 (10-40). Almost 30% were >40 years. Patients with complications were eight patients, age 63 (51.5-71.5). The prediction model identified the following variables as risk factors: diabetes (OR = 59.7; 95% CI: 3.5-1011.5, p = 0.005), fever (OR = 24.8; 95% CI: 1.4-447.3, p = 0.029), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (OR = 15.9; 95% CI: 1.3-189.7, p = 0.029), body mass index (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61-0.88, p = 0.001), abnormal Neutrophils (OR = 16.8; 95% CI: 1.0-292.0, p = 0.053). Prediction model was statistically significant, chi2(5) = 86.1, p < 0.0005., CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports from China, the most influential variables that led to disease progression in Jordanian patients were diabetes, fever, shortness of breath, body mass index, and abnormal neutrophils. Similar to reports from the USA, smoking was not a leading factor for complications. Comorbidities and patient health status, rather than age, were the primary risk factors for complications. Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine showed no protective effect. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explored how Covid-19 lockdown restrictions affected people's daily smoking routines and behaviours, including adherence and modifications to pre-established smoking restrictions in the home. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with smokers and non-smokers from smoking households 19 to 27 weeks after the first full UK lockdown ended in May 2020. A non-probability purposive sample representing 25 adults aged 21 or over living in households with at least 1 smoker were recruited to the study. A quota sampling strategy was used, according to age, gender, smoking status, family status, household composition, householder access to outdoor space, and change to work-life status. Most participants found lockdown increased the amount of time spent at home, where stresses associated with confinement, curtailment of social routines, removal of barriers and distractions to smoking due to home working, and feelings of boredom all contributed to increased smoking. Fewer factors were identified as reducing smoking during lockdown. Prominent examples included disruption to habitual smoking patterns and distraction from smoking associated with spending more time doing outdoor activities. Pressures placed on physical space and lack of privacy due to the confinement at home were responsible for displacement of smoking within the home, leading to breaking of smoke-free rules and family tensions, and in some cases to greater awareness amongst parents that their children smoked. Changes in daily routines associated with lockdown affected and displaced smoking behaviour both positively and negatively. Health improvement interventions could seek to harness positive changes in smoking associated with any future lockdown approaches. New home-working norms highlight the need for employers to support staff to reduce their smoking and to remain smoke-free.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources in intensive care units (ICUs) have the potential to be inadequate to treat all those who might benefit. Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation., METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible., RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms as well as suicide-related ideation among Japanese university students during the stay-home order necessitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan, and offer evidence in support of future intervention to depression and suicide prevention strategies among college and university students., METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the Student Mental Health Survey conducted from May 20 to June 16, 2020 at a national university in Akita prefecture. Among the 5111 students recruited, 2712 participated in this study (response rate, 53%; mean age +/- standard deviation, 20.5 +/-3.5 years; men, 53.8%). Depressive symptoms were identified by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)., RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate depressive symptoms based on a PHQ-9 score >=10 and suicide-related ideation based on question 9 of PHQ-9 >=1, which encompasses thoughts of both suicide and self-harm, was 11.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that risk factors for depression included being a woman, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social network communication using either video or voice. For suicide-related ideation, alcohol consumption was the only risk factor. Exercise and having someone to consult about worries were associated with decreased risk of both depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation., CONCLUSIONS: Negative lifestyles of smoking and drinking, and being a woman, may be important risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas exercise and having someone to consult about worries may be protective factors.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Respiratory failure is the major cause of death in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Data on factors affecting the need for oxygen therapy in early-stage COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with the need for oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19. This is a retrospective study of consecutive COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between February 27 and June 28, 2020, in South Korea. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the need for oxygen therapy.Of the 265 patients included in the study, 26 (9.8%) received oxygen therapy, and 7 of these patients (29.2%) were transferred to a step-up facility, and 3 (11.5%) died. The median age of all patients was 46 years (IQR, 30-60 years), and the median modified early warning score at admission was 1 (IQR, 1-2). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, being a current smoker (odds ratio [OR] 7.641, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.686-34.630, P = .008), heart rate (OR 1.053, 95% CI 1.010-1.097, P = .014), aspartate aminotransferase values (OR 1.049, 95% CI 1.008-1.092, P = .020), blood urea nitrogen levels (OR 1.171, 95% CI 1.073-1.278, P < .001), and chest radiographic findings (OR 3.173, 95% CI 1.870-5.382, P < .001) were associated with oxygen therapy. In patients with less severe COVID-19, the need for oxygen therapy is affected by smoking and elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen. Further research is warranted on the risk factors for deterioration in COVID-19 to efficiently allocate medical resources. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 the Author(s).

AB  - Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a cytokine produced by various cells of the human body (macrophages, lymphocytes, astrocytes, ischemic myocytes, endothelial cells) has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties, being a key component in regulating various physiologic and pathological processes. The structure of this molecule and the receptor system it possesses are important due to the different activities that IL-6 can exert; through trans-signaling pro-inflammatory activities are mediated, while through classic signaling, IL-6 is responsible for anti-inflammatory and regenerative activities. IL-6 signaling is involved in coronary artery disease and the global COVID-19 pandemic. This proatherogenic cytokine reaches elevated serum levels in the cytokine storm generated by SARS-CoV-2, and is also associated with smoking or obesity-classic cardiovascular risk factors which promote inflammatory states. IL-6 levels are proportionally correlated with dyslipidemia, hypertension and glucose dysregulation, and they are associated with poor outcomes in patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. IL-6 targeting for treatment development (not only) in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is still a matter of ongoing research, although tocilizumab has proven to be effective in reducing the proatherogenic effects of IL-6 and is suggested to improve COVID-19 patient survival.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The response to the COVID-19 pandemic became increasingly politicized in the U.S., and the political affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. This study examines the differences in COVID-19 infection, death, and testing by governor party affiliation across the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia., METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was conducted in December 2020 examining COVID-19 incidence, death, testing, and test positivity rates from March 15, 2020 through December 15, 2020. A Bayesian negative binomial model was fit to estimate the daily risk ratios and posterior intervals comparing rates by gubernatorial party affiliation. The analyses adjusted for state population density, rurality, Census region, age, race, ethnicity, poverty, number of physicians, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, and presidential voting in 2020., RESULTS: From March 2020 to early June 2020, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates than Democratic-led states. On June 3, 2020, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had a higher incidence (risk ratio=1.10, 95% posterior interval=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December 2020. For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic but higher rates from July 4, 2020 (risk ratio=1.18, 95% posterior interval=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December 2020. Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30, 2020 (risk ratio=1.70, 95% posterior interval=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30, 2020 (risk ratio=0.95, 95% posterior interval=0.90, 0.98)., CONCLUSIONS: Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the U.S. Future policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than by political ideology.

AB  - Nicotine is a prominent active compound in tobacco and many smoking cessation products. Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, data are scarce concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment. We also explored the proposed association between smoking (specifically nicotine) and SARS-CoV2. Here, we found several host proteins known to interact with viral proteins that were affected by nicotine in a time dependent manner. This dataset can be mined further to investigate the potential role of nicotine in different biological contexts. SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking is a major public health issue that is associated with several serious chronic, yet preventable diseases, including stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and susceptibility to infection. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different compounds, among which nicotine is the main addictive compound. The biological effects of nicotine have been reported in several models, however very little data are available concerning the temporal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in response to nicotine. Here, we provide a dataset exploring the potential role of nicotine on different biological processes over time, including implications in the study of SARS-CoV2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been described in patients from Europe, North America and China, but there are few data from COVID-19 patients in Middle Eastern countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 +/- 14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25-75% interquartile range: 4-10) and 10 (25-75% interquartile range: 7-14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk., CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.

PY  - 2021
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are various reports of air leaks with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review of all published case reports and series to analyse the types of air leaks in COVID-19 and their outcomes., METHODS: The literature search from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases was performed from the start of the pandemic till 31 March 2021. The inclusion criteria were case reports or series on (1) laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, (2) with the individual patient details, and (3) reported diagnosis of one or more air leak syndrome (pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, pneumopericardium)., RESULTS: A total of 105 studies with 188 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 56.02 (SD 15.53) years, 80% males, 11% had previous respiratory disease, and 8% were smokers. Severe or critical COVID-19 was present in 50.6% of the patients. Pneumothorax (68%) was the most common type of air leak. Most patients (56.7%) required intervention with lower mortality (29.1% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.07) and intercostal drain (95.9%) was the preferred interventional management. More than half of the patients developed air leak on spontaneous breathing. The mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed air leak with positive pressure ventilation (49%, p < 0.001) and required escalation of respiratory support (39%, p = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Air leak in COVID-19 can occur spontaneously without positive pressure ventilation, higher transpulmonary pressures, and other risk factors like previous respiratory disease or smoking. The mortality is significantly higher if associated with positive pressure ventilation and escalation of respiratory support.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate body mass index, multi-morbidity, and COVID-19 Risk Score as predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes., PATIENTS: Patients from this study are from a well-characterized patient cohort collected at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 2020 and May 23, 2020; with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays from nasopharyngeal swab specimens., MEASURES: Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The data included: date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, medications (active COVID-19 agents), weight and height (from which the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, history of smoking, and comorbid conditions to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) multi-morbidity score. An additional COVID-19 Risk Score was also included. Outcomes included hospital admission, ICU admission, and death., RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact on mortality or hospital admission. Age, sex, and race (white/Latino, white/non-Latino, other, did not disclose) were adjusted for in the model. Patients with higher COVID-19 Risk Scores had a significantly higher likelihood of being at least admitted to the hospital (HR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.30, 2.50; P < .001), or experiencing death or inpatient admission (includes ICU admissions) (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.42; P = .028). Age was the only statistically significant demographic predictor, but obesity was not a significant predictor of any of the outcomes., CONCLUSION: Age and COVID-19 Risk Scores were significant predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Further work should examine the properties of the COVID-19 Risk Factors Scale.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 114 million people and has resulted in >2.5 million deaths so far. Some people have greater susceptibility which influences both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. Smoking is associated with increased ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates its entry through the lung. However, despite the widespread use of e-cigarettes, also known as 'vaping', little is known regarding the effects of vaping on ACE-2 expression and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the added effect of nicotine in the vapor is also unknown. Thus, we tested whether vaping induces ACE-2 expression in the mouse lung. BALB/c mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor (+/-nicotine) resulted in a significant increase in peribronchiolar inflammation and influx of immune cells into the airways. Vapor increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 1beta, and KC levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both sexes, which were further enhanced by nicotine (whereas increase in interleukin 6 was sex and nicotine independent). The reduction in basal inspiratory capacity with vapor exposure occurred independent of sex or nicotine. The increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was independent of sex; however, in female mice it was only significant in the nicotine-exposed group. Lung ACE-2 expression was increased in male mice in a nicotine-dependent manner as compared with female mice. Collectively, while vaping (+/-nicotine) induced airway inflammation and impaired lung function, the induction of lung ACE-2 occurred to a significantly greater degree in males exposed to vapor containing nicotine as compared with females. Thus, via these effects on ACE-2 expression in the lungs and airways, vaping itself may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into the airways. Copyright <c2><a9> American Federation for Medical Research 2021.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Asymptomatic active infection might be an important contributor to the COVID-19 outbreak. Serological tests can assess the extent of exposure and herd immunity to COVID-19 in general populations. This study aimed to estimate the nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, sex and clinical status in South Korea., DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany)., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39% (95% CI=0.20% to 0.58%): 0.30% (95% CI=0.06% to 0.54%) for men and 0.48% (95% CI=0.18% to 0.78%) for women. The rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity varied significantly between different regions of Korea (p=0.003), but not with age group, sex, or the statuses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension or smoking., CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Korean population is still immunologically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but the seroprevalence has increased relative to that found in studies performed prior to September 2020 in Korea.

AB  - This study reports systematic longitudinal pathophysiology of lung parenchymal and vascular effects of asymptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia in a young, healthy never-smoking male. Inspiratory and Expiratory non-contrast along with contrast Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) scans of the chest were performed at baseline on the day of acute COVID-19 diagnosis (Day 0), and across a 90 day period. Despite normal vital signs and pulmonary function tests on the day of diagnosis, the CT scans and corresponding quantification metrics detected abnormalities in parenchymal expansion based on image registration, ground glass (GGO) texture (inflammation) as well as DECT-derived pulmonary blood volume (PBV). Follow-up scans on Day 30 showed improvement in the lung parenchymal mechanics as well as reduced GGO and improved PBV distribution. Improvements in lung PBV continued until Day 90. However, the heterogeneity of parenchymal mechanics and texture-derived GGO increased on Days 60 and 90. We highlight that even asymptomatic COVID-19 infection with unremarkable vital signs and pulmonary function tests can have measurable effects on lung parenchymal mechanics and vascular pathophysiology, which may follow apparently different clinical courses. For this asymptomatic subject, post COVID-19 regional mechanics demonstrated persistent increased heterogeneity concomitant with return of elevated GGOs, despite early improvements in vascular derangement.

AB  - Genetic and nongenetic factors associated with an increased inflammatory response may mediate a link between severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and serious mental illness (SMI). However, systematic assessment of inflammatory response-related factors associated with SMI that could influence COVID-19 outcomes is lacking. In the present review, dietary patterns, smoking and the use of psychotropic medications are discussed as potential extrinsic risk factors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphisms are considered as potential intrinsic risk factors. A genetics-based prediction model for SMI using ACE-I/D genotyping is also proposed for use in patients experiencing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, the literature suggests that ACE inhibitors may have protective effects against SMI or severe COVID-19, which is often linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities. For this reason, we hypothesize that using these medications to treat patients with severe COVID-19 might yield improved outcomes, including in the context of SMI associated with COVID-19.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and accessory proteases (TMPRSS2 and CTSL) are needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cellular entry, and their expression may shed light on viral tropism and impact across the body. We assessed the cell-type-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL across 107 single-cell RNA-sequencing studies from different tissues. ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are coexpressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways and alveoli, and in cells from other organs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission or pathology. We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Expression of entry factors increased with age and in males, including in airway secretory cells and alveolar type 2 cells. Expression programs shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues included genes that may mediate viral entry, key immune functions and epithelial-macrophage cross-talk, such as genes involved in the interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and complement pathways. Cell-type-specific expression patterns may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and our work highlights putative molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Could the COVID-19 Positive Asymptomatic Tobacco Smoker be a Silent Superspeader?
AU  - Muscat Baron, Yves
PY  - 2021
AB  - There appears to be a connection between COVID-19 infection and an airborne microscopic pollutant called particulate matter which has been suggested to act as vector for viral transmission. The highest human exposure to particulate matter occurs during smoking and to a lesser extent applies to 2nd hand smoking. This article offers a hypothetical proposition that particulate matter derived from tobacco smoking may act as COVID-19's vector for infection transmission. With a background smoking Chinese male population of more than 66% and more than 70% of Chinese nonsmokers exposed to 2nd hand smoke the potential of exhaled smoke acting as a viral vector is significant. If this hypothesis is proven, measures such as face protection to reduce coronavirus-laden particulate matter transmission, measures of social distancing and legislation to protect nonsmokers from contracting the infection through 2nd hand smoking should be implemented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking negatively impacts COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. Evidence on whether smoking is associated with SARS-Co-V2 infection and having a positive test is scarce, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, where most of the world's billion smokers live. The inconsistency in relevant findings calls for study designs and analyses to account for possible confounders including background characteristics and pre-existing co-morbidities, to disentangle the specific effect of smoking. In healthcare workers (HCWs) the frequency of exposure to COVID-19 cases adds another layer of risk that was not factored in previous studies. We examined the association of HCWs' tobacco/nicotine use (never, former, and current use) with having a positive SARS-Co-V2 test result and symptoms suggestive of infection, accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 4040 healthcare workers with baseline and follow-up screening took place during April-June 2020 in 12 healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt. Data on demographics, tobacco/nicotine use (manufactured or roll-your-own cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and electronic devices), co-morbidities, symptoms, exposures, and SARS-Co-V2 investigations were analyzed. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Overall, 270/4040 (6.7, 95%CI: 5.9-7.5) had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 479 (11.9%) were current and 79 (2.0%) were former tobacco/nicotine users. The proportion of positive tests was 7.0% (243/3482, 95%CI: 6.1-7.8) among never, 5.1% (4/79, 95%CI: 0.1-10.0) among former, and 4.8% (23/479, 95%CI: 2.9-6.7) among current users. HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 test results did not vary significantly by single/multiple or daily/non-daily tobacco/nicotine use. Compared to never users, former users were more likely to self-report a pre-existing medical condition (ORadjusted1.87, 95%CI: 1.05-3.33, p = 0.033), and to experience symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (ORadjusted1.76, 95%CI: 1.07-2.90, p = 0.027). After adjustment, former (ORadjusted0.45, 95%CI: 0.11-1.89, p = 0.273) and current (ORadjusted0.65, 95%CI: 0.38-1.09, p = 0.101) tobacco/nicotine use was not associated with HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 positive test results., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on this association from low- and middle-income countries with high tobacco/nicotine use prevalence. In this HCW cohort, having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was not associated with tobacco/nicotine use after accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities. Additional population-based studies could use such preliminary evidence to investigate this controversial association.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a sudden global change in healthcare systems. Cancer patients have a higher risk of death from COVID-19 in comparison to patients without cancer. Many studies have stated that various factors, such as older age, frequent exposure to healthcare, and higher smoking rates are responsible for the complications of COVID-19. We hypothesize that side effects of chemotherapy, such as cellular senescence, could worsen COVID-19. Given this situation, in this review, we highlight the updated findings of research investigating the impact of cellular senescence on COVID-19 complications and explored potential therapeutic targets for eliminating senescent cells during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With global efforts to develop and deliver a COVID-19 vaccine rapidly, vaccine hesitancy stands as a barrier to these efforts. We aimed to estimate the proportion of Syrian adult population intending to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, principally, to assess the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with it in order to approach suitable solutions., METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire was conducted between 23rd December 2020 and 5th January 2021 in various provinces in Syria. A total of 3402 adults were sampled to reflect the population demographic factors. Attitudinal factors included Covid-19 fears, risks, and beliefs on the origin. Vaccination hesitancy and knowledge were also measured. The intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was the primary endpoint., RESULTS: According to their statements, 1222 participants (35.92%) will consent to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Our findings indicate that male gender, younger age, rural residence, not having children, smoking, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived severity, believing in the natural origin of the coronavirus, and high vaccination knowledge were positive predictors of embracing COVID-19 vaccine when it is available., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate is considerably poor across Syrian population compared to populations in developed countries. Vaccine hesitancy is closely bound to the fear of side effects and doubts about vaccine efficacy. Factors such as conspiracy beliefs and myths about the vaccine lower vaccine uptake. Thus, interventional educational campaigns are increasingly required to overcome misinformation and avert low vaccination acceptance rates.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Patients on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) are at a very high risk of COVID-19. Triage pathway for KRT patients presenting with varying severity of COVID-19 illness remains ill-defined. We studied clinical characteristics of patients at initial and subsequent hospital presentations and its impact on patient outcomes., STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) was analysed for clinical and laboratory features of 1423 KRT patients with COVID-19 either hospitalized or non-hospitalized during first presentation and those representing after non-admission at initial triage. Predictors of outcomes (Hospitalisation, 28-day mortality) were determined for those not hospitalized at first presentation., RESULTS: Amongst 1423 KRT patients with COVID-19 (Hemodialysis = 1017/Transplant = 406), 25% (n = 355) were not hospitalized at first presentation (30% Hemodialysis/13% Transplant). Of these non-hospitalized patients, 10% (n = 36) re-presented second time, with a 5-day median interval between two presentations (Interquartile interval 2-7 days). Patients who re-presented had worsening respiratory symptoms, a fall in oxygen saturation (97% vs. 90%) and rise in C-reactive protein between attendances (26 vs. 73 mg/L). Patients on second presentation were older (72 vs. 63 years), had early respiratory symptoms and lung imaging abnormalities compared with those who did not return second time. The 28-day mortality for those admitted at first or second presentations was not significantly different (25% vs. 29%, p = 0.6). Higher age, prior smoking history, higher clinical frailty score and self-reported shortness of breath at first presentation, were identified as predictors of mortality in those discharged at initial triage., CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that KRT patients with COVID-19 and mild pulmonary abnormalities with lack of pulmonary insufficiency can be safely discharged, with vigilance of respiratory symptoms, especially in those with risk factors for poor outcomes. Our findings support a risk-stratified clinical approach to admissions and discharges of KRT patients presenting with COVID-19, to aid clinical triage and optimise resource utilisation during the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The worldwide pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to date. Given that some of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are asymptomatic, antibody tests are useful to determine whether there is a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we measured IgM and IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of asymptomatic healthy subjects in The University of Tokyo, Japan., METHODS: From June 2020, we recruited participants, who were students, staff, and faculty members of The University of Tokyo in the project named The University of Tokyo COVID-19 Antibody Titer Survey (UT-CATS). Following blood sample collection, participants were required to answer an online questionnaire about their social and health information. We measured IgG and IgM titers against SARS-CoV-2 using iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection kit which applies a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) for the qualitative detection., RESULTS: There were 6609 volunteers in this study. After setting the cutoff value at 10 AU/mL, 32 (0.48%) were positive for IgG and 16 (0.24%) for IgM. Of six participants with a history of COVID-19, five were positive for IgG, whereas all were negative for IgM. The median titer of IgG was 0.40 AU/mL and 0.39 AU/mL for IgM. Both IgG and IgM titers were affected by gender, age, smoking status, and comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Positive rates of IgG and IgM titers were relatively low in our university. Serum levels of these antibodies were affected by several factors, which might affect the clinical course of COVID-19.

AB  - The present study explored the changes in tobacco use patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and their correlates among older adults in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1032 older adults aged >=60 years in Bangladesh through telephone interviews in October 2020. Participants ' characteristics and COVID-19-related information were gathered using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire. Participants were asked if they noted any change in their tobacco use patterns (smoking or smokeless tobacco) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (6 months prior to the survey). Nearly half of the participants (45.6%) were current tobacco users, of whom 15.9% reported increased tobacco use during the COVID-19 pandemic and all others had no change in their tobacco use patterns. Tobacco use was significantly increased among the participants from rural areas, who had reduced communications during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic (OR = 2.76, 95%CI:1.51-5.03). Participants who were aged >=70 years (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.14-0.77), widowed (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.13-1.00), had pre-existing, non-communicable, and/or chronic conditions (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.78), and felt themselves at the highest risk of COVID-19 (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15-0.62), had significantly lower odds of increased tobacco use. Policy makers and practitioners need to focus on strengthening awareness and raising initiatives to avoid tobacco use during such a crisis period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin cancer represents the most common malignancy worldwide and it is imperative that we develop strategies to ensure safe and sustained delivery of cancer care which are resilient to the ongoing impact of COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk and skin cancer management at a single tertiary referral centre, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines., METHOD: A prospective cohort study was performed in all patients who underwent surgery for elective skin cancer service management, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020). 'Real-time' 30-day hospital database deceased data were collected. Random selection was undertaken for patients who either underwent operative (surgery group) management or remained on the waiting list (control group); these groups were also prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at the end of June 2020 for the control group or 30 days post-operatively., RESULTS: Of the 767 patients who had operations, there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both the surgery (n = 384) and control (n = 100) groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, presence of comorbidities, smoking and positive COVID-19 contact. There were no differences in post-operative versus any symptom development (1.3%, 5/384 vs. 4%, 4/100, p = 0.093), or proportion of positive tests (8.6%, 33/384 vs. 8%, 8/100; p = 0.849), between the surgery and control groups., CONCLUSION: These data support continued and safe service provision, and no increased risk to skin cancer patients who require surgical management, which is vital for continuation of cancer treatment in the context of a pandemic., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought in 2020 an important challenge for health-care systems and authorities. Smoking and its influence on this disease remain, after months of the pandemic, one of the debatable risk factors. From the literature point of view, the focus of most articles is on smoking as a possible general risk factor for all analyzed populations. Women tend to represent a more significant population in exposed occupations. In our mini-review, we try to dig deeper, looking for gender-related health effects of smoking in this pandemic context, its effects on the infection with this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on illness severity, and on the rate of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the fact that the male gender is reported in many articles as a predictor of a poor outcome, we suggest that further research is needed to confirm or deny these relationships. Moreover, studies focusing specifically on women in these study populations are required. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Mihaltan, Rajnoveanu and Rajnoveanu.

AB  - BACKGROUND: How adolescent substance use and perceived availability of substances have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic remain largely unknown. Substantial reduction in availability of substances would present a unique opportunity to consider the supply-side hypothesis that reductions in drug availability will lead to reductions in drug prevalence., METHODS: Longitudinal data come from Monitoring the Future and are based on responses from 582 adolescents who were originally surveyed as part of a national sample of 12th grade students in early 2020, one month before social distancing policies began. They were surveyed again after social distancing policies were implemented, in the summer of 2020., RESULTS: Perceived availability of marijuana and alcohol declined across the two survey waves at the largest levels ever recorded in the 46 years of the project, by an absolute 17 %, p < .01 and 24 %, p < .01, respectively. Despite these declines, prevalence levels did not significantly change across the two waves for marijuana use in the past 30 days or for binge drinking in the past two weeks. Perceived availability of vaping devices significantly declined, from 73 % to 63 %, as did nicotine vaping prevalence in the past 30 days, from 24 % to 17 %., CONCLUSIONS: Perceived availability of marijuana, alcohol, and vaping devices declined at historic rates during the pandemic of 2020. Lack of accompanying reductions in prevalence for marijuana and binge drinking demonstrates the substantial challenges facing a supply-side approach to the reduction of adolescent use of these substances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading cause of premature death, and low-income adults suffer disproportionate burden from tobacco. Mindfulness interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation. A text messaging program, iQuit Mindfully, was created to deliver just-in-time support for quitting smoking among low-income adults. A pilot study of iQuit Mindfully was conducted in spring 2020, right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income and predominantly African American smokers., OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the acceptability and feasibility of delivering Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment via mHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Participants were adult cigarette smokers (N=23, 35% [8 of 23] female, 83% African American, 78% [18 of 23] annual income <$24,000). They were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of iQuit Mindfully as a fully automated standalone intervention or iQuit Mindfully in combination with therapist-led in-person group treatment. For participant safety, in-person mindfulness groups were transitioned online and assessments took place online. Survey questions asked participants about changes in their stress, smoking habits and quit attempts, as well as their perceptions of the mindfulness and text messaging intervention in the context of the pandemic., RESULTS: Most participants (71%, 15 of 21) indicated a change in stress due to the pandemic, with 93% (14 of 15) of those indicating higher stress. Participants shared concerns about finances, homelessness, health and social isolation. Most (81%, 17 of 21) believed that smoking increases risk for contracting COVID-19, and although that was motivating for some, others expressed lower motivation to quit because of higher stress. Most (86%, 18 of 21) said that practicing mindfulness was helpful during the pandemic. Mean ratings of the helpfulness of text messages and the extent they would recommend the program to others were 7.1 (median 8 on 10-point scale, SD=2.9) and 8.2 (median 9, SD=2.5), respectively. Through open-ended program evaluations, participants shared details about how mindfulness practice and the text messages helped them to manage stress and feel a sense of social support during the pandemic. Moreover, 53% (10 of 19) of participants achieved 7-day abstinence from smoking, with no differences between conditions., CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the promise of text messaging and use of teleconferencing to provide mindfulness and smoking cessation services to underserved populations during a global pandemic., CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - Behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, obesity, and unhealthy food intake are added risk factors for severe outcomes of COVID-19 infections. Preventive measures to avoid infections are therefore particularly important for individuals engaging in behavioral risk factors. We seek to determine whether behavioral risk factors (BRFs) play a significant role in the adherence to preventive COVID-19 measures in a population aged 50 and above. The SHARE wave 8 (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and SHARE COVID-19 Survey served as the database, resulting in an analytical sample of 17,588 respondents from 23 European countries plus Israel. Of these 36.04% engaged in at least one BRF and 16.68% engaged in 3 or more BRFs. Multilevel logistic regressions revealed that engagement in one BRF was significantly associated with less adherence to hygiene preventive measures, i.e., hand-sanitizing, hand-washing and covering coughs and sneezes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.94), as was engagement in two BRFs (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.97) and three or more BRFs (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59; 0.88). No such association was found between engagement in BRFs and adherences to social isolation preventive measures, i.e., avoiding meeting more than five people, visiting others or going shopping, or regulated preventive measures, i.e., wearing a mask and keeping physical distance. The found association was also stronger when three or more BRFs were engaged in (1 vs. 3 BRFs: chi2 = 3.43, p = 0.06; 2 vs. 3 BRFs: chi2 = 6.05; p = 0.01). The study gives insight into the protective behavior of a population with inherent vulnerability during a global health emergency. It lays the foundation for follow-up research about the evolution of adherence to preventive measures as the pandemic progresses and about long-term behavioral changes. In addition, it can aide efforts in increasing preventive compliance by raising awareness of the added risk behavioral risk factors pose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as confinement and social interaction limitations that paradoxically may have aggravated healthcare access disparities for pregnant women and accentuated health system weaknesses addressing high-risk patients' pregnancies. Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19., METHODS: A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020-February 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution., RESULTS: Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of < 19 or > 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death. Measures are needed to improve access to coordinated well-organized healthcare to reduce maternal deaths related to COVID-19 and pandemic collateral effects.

AB  - Marginalized populations are being disproportionally affected by the current pandemic. Direct effects include higher infection rates with greater morbidity and mortality; indirect effects stem from the societal response to limit the spread of the virus. These same groups also have smoking rates that are significantly higher than the general population. In this commentary, we discuss how the pandemic has been acting to further increase the harm from tobacco endured by these groups by applying the syndemic framework. Using this approach, we elaborate on the factors that promote clustering of harms from tobacco with harms from COVID-19. These include the worsening of psychological distress, a potential increase in smoking behaviour, greater exposure to second-hand smoke and less access to smoking cessation services. Then, we offer mitigation strategies to protect disadvantaged groups from tobacco-related harm during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies include affordable smoking cessation services, a proactive approach for smoking treatment using information technology, opportunistic screening and treatment of tobacco dependence among individuals presenting for COVID-19 vaccination, policy interventions for universal coverage of cessation pharmacotherapy, comprehensive smoke-free policies and regulation of tobacco retail density. Now more than ever, coordinated action between clinicians, health care systems, public health organizations and health policy makers is needed to protect vulnerable groups from the harm of tobacco.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study aim was to assess the influence of inflammatory response modifiers, including anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) biologics and corticosteroids, on the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: Case-control study performed at a university hospital from February 26 to May 26, 2020. Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 who developed hospital-acquired infections. For each case, two controls were selected among patients without infections. Cases and controls were matched obeying three criteria in a hierarchical sequence: length of hospital stay up until the first infection; comorbidity; and need for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of exposures with being a case., RESULTS: A total of 71 cases and 142 controls were included. Independent predictors for acquiring a hospital infection were chronic liver disease [odds ratio (OR) 16.56, 95% CI 1.87-146.5, p = 0.012], morbid obesity (OR 6.11, 95% CI 1.06-35.4, p = 0.043), current or past smoking (OR 4.15, 95% CI 1.45-11.88, p = 0.008), exposure to hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.041-1, p = 0.053), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 61.5, 95% CI 11.08-341, p <= 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory response modifiers had no influence on acquisition of nosocomial infections in admitted patients with COVID-19. Hospital-acquired infections primarily occurred in the critically ill and invasive mechanical ventilation was the main exposure conferring risk.

AB  - Corona virus disease was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is spreading across the world in an alarming fashion. To contain the spread, it is very important to identify the subtle/not readily apparent symptoms of COVID-19 at the earliest. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence duration progress of sino-nasal symptoms in COV 2 positive patients using SNAQ scoring. Patients who tested positive for SARS-COV 2 by RT-PCR and admitted in our hospital under category A (n = 382) were included in the study. A detailed history was collected from all the patients and sino-nasal assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) was provided to the patient with complaints of sinonasal symptoms and they were asked to fill the forms on day 3, 7 and 14. To identify the characteristics of sinonasal symptoms in COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking, smoking history was also collected in detail and patients were classified based on Brinkman's index into mild, moderate and severe smokers. In this study, the incidence of sinonasal symptoms was 24%. Average SNAQ scoring on day 3 was 30.09 and on day 7 was 12.9 and day 14 is 3.8. There was a decline in score on day 7 compared to day 3 indicating symptoms decrease by day7. Average SNAQ scoring in non-smokers and mild and moderate smokers was 20.18, 34.11, 57.5 respectively. The SNAQ scoring in smokers was more than that of non-smokers and was also persistent for a longer duration compared to non-smokers. Sino-nasal symptoms catch our eye because it is an important route for transmission. Viral shedding from sinonasal tract may be an important source for transmission. History and degree of smoking should also be considered while dividing COVID-19 patients into categories. Copyright <c2><a9> Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021.

AB  - The overall aim of this study is to examine vape shop business operations during COVID-19 among a cohort of 88 vape shops in the Greater Los Angeles area in Southern California, located in ethnically diverse communities. A total of six web- and/or phone-based assessments were conducted over a 12-week period (April 1, 2020-June 10, 2020), extending from the mandated closure of nonessential businesses (Stage 1; Assessments 1-3) to the reopening of nonessential sectors (Stage 2; Assessments 4-6), to evaluate business operations (open and closure statuses). The proportion of vape shops found to be noncompliant with the Governor's executive order (i.e., open) during Stage 1 gradually increased from 54 (61.4%) at Assessment 1 (week of April 1, 2020) to 58 (65.9%) at Assessment 3 (week of April 29, 2020). Moreover, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian communities (vs. those in non-Hispanic White and African American communities) were more likely to stay open both during and after the shutdown at Assessments 1 and 6. More specifically, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino communities were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 1 (during the shutdown), and vape shops in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 6 (after the re-opening). This study demonstrates high rates of noncompliance with shutdown orders among vape shops located in ethnic communities, thus suggesting higher contextual risk factors of COVID-19 exposure among certain ethnic communities.

AB  - Objectives: To examine associations of changing employment conditions, specifically switching to working from home (WFH) or job loss, with mental health, using data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data from 2,301 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd-7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were WFH when they had not been before, or they had lost their job due to the pandemic. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and positive mental health (PMH) assessed using validated questionnaires. Linear regression quantified associations of employment changes with mental health outcomes, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, screen time, physical activity, marital status, chronic conditions, and current COVID-19 containment strategies being followed. Results: Compared to participants whose employment remained unchanged, those who switched to WFH did not differ in any measures of mental health (all p >= 0.200). Participants who had lost their job reported higher symptoms of depression (g = -0.200, 95%CI = -0.333 to -0.067; p = 0.003), anxiety (g = -0.212, -0.363 to -0.061; p = 0.008), and stress (g = -0.348, -0.482 to -0.214; p < 0.001), and lower PMH (g = -0.212, -0.347 to -0.078; p = 0.002). Loneliness did not differ between groups (p = 0.087). Conclusion: This study demonstrates (1) that concerns around potential adverse mental health effects, particularly increases in loneliness, should not preclude WFH in the general population, while considering each individual's personal circumstances, and (2) the acute adverse association of job loss with mental health. Tailored and sensitive interventions may be required to prevent deteriorations in mental health associated with job loss during periods of societal stress.

AB  - Tobacco smoking has emerged as a risk factor for increasing the susceptibility to infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in the lung, linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) development. Given the modifiable nature of electronic cigarettes and the delivery of high concentrations of nicotine, we investigate whether electronic cigarette vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We exposed BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B) and primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) to electronic cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin or commercially bought e-liquid (+/-added nicotine) and cigarette smoke extract to investigate if electronic cigarette exposure, like cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. In BEAS-2B cells, cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity (LDH), and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24 h treatments in BEAS-2B cells and 4 h in SAECs; ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 4 h treatment in BEAS-2B cells. Nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells. Higher LDH release and reduced membrane integrity were seen in BEAS-2B cells treated for 24 h with higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates. ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to cell controls, particularly for 24 h exposures. ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to the locally bought e-liquid condensate with high nicotine concentration and cigarette smoke extract compared with cell controls. Our study suggests that vaping alone and smoking alone can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression. Vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for COVID-19, which, if avoided, could help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the severity of the disease. This is the first study to utilize electronic cigarette aerosol condensates, novel and developed in our laboratory, for investigating ACE2 expression in human airway epithelial cells.

AB  - CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus 2019/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a virus that has caused a pandemic with high numbers of deaths worldwide. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities on the population. Today, we are witnessing the so-called "second wave" COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with an increasing number of cases similar to the one reported at the beginning of the current year. It is plausible that further restrictions will be applied to contain the "second wave" of infections. The present commentary evaluated the effects of stress on lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic in women. We briefly suggest practical recommendations for women to reduce stress and recovery for a healthy lifestyle after quarantine. Quarantine is associated with stress and depression, which lead to unhealthy lifestyle, including unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol, and reduced physical activity. Women are more likely to suffer from depression and stress and quarantine has acted as a trigger. The prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world requires decisive action to correct the unhealthy lifestyle that has developed in recent months. Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Ground-glass opacity is a very frequent and unspecified finding in chest computed tomography. Therefore, it admits a wide range of differential diagnoses in the acute context, from viral pneumonias such as influenza virus, coronavirus disease 2019 and cytomegalovirus and even non-infectious lesions, such as vaping, pulmonary infarction, alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary edema. For this diagnostic differentiation, ground glass must be correlated with other findings in imaging tests, with laboratory tests and with the patients' clinical condition. In the context of a pandemic, it is extremely important to remember the other pathologies with similar findings to coronavirus disease 2019 in the imaging exams.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) are at a significantly higher risk for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and have higher rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization and death than those without SUD. This study assessed COVID-19 vaccine trust, transmission awareness, risk and protective behaviors, and effects of COVID-19 on mental health and smoking among a sample of clients in California residential SUD treatment programs and identified factors associated with vaccine trust., METHODS: A multi-site sample of SUD treatment clients (n = 265) completed a cross-sectional survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine trust., RESULTS: Participants were predominantly male (82.3 %) and racially/ethnically diverse (33.3 % Non-Hispanic White). Most participants were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission, however, only 39.5 % trusted a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Factors independently associated with trust in a COVID-19 vaccine included age (AOR = 1.03, 95 % CI = 1.02, 1.05, p = 0.0001) and wearing a mask all the time (AOR = 2.48, 95 % CI = 1.86, 3.31, p = 0.0001). African Americans were less likely than White participants to trust that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective (AOR = 0.41, 95 % CI = 0.23, 0.70, p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: SUD treatment clients were aware of COVID-19 modes of transmission; however, fewer than half trusted that a COVID-19 vaccine would be safe and effective. Health communication about COVID-19 for people with SUD should use a multipronged approach to address COVID-19 vaccine mistrust and transmission risk behaviors. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021.

AB  - Conventional smoking is known to both increase susceptibility to infection and drive inflammation within the lungs. Recently, smokers have been found to be at higher risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). E-cigarette aerosol inhalation (vaping) has been associated with several inflammatory lung disorders, including the recent e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic, and recent studies have suggested that vaping alters host susceptibility to pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To assess the impact of vaping on lung inflammatory pathways, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, mice were exposed to e-cigarette aerosols for 60 min daily for 1-6 months and underwent gene expression analysis. Hierarchical clustering revealed extensive gene expression changes occurred in the lungs of both inbred C57BL/6 mice and outbred CD1 mice, with 2,933 gene expression changes in C57BL/6 mice, and 2,818 gene expression changes in CD1 mice (>abs 1.25-fold change). Particularly, large reductions in IgA and CD4 were identified, indicating impairment of host responses to pathogens via reductions in immunoglobulins and CD4 T cells. CD177, facmr, tlr9, fcgr1, and ccr2 were also reduced, consistent with diminished host defenses via decreased neutrophils and/or monocytes in the lungs. Gene set enrichment (GSE) plots demonstrated upregulation of gene expression related to cell activation specifically in neutrophils. As neutrophils are a potential driver of acute lung injury in COVID-19, increased neutrophil activation in the lungs suggests that vapers are at higher risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. The receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, ACE2, was found to have moderate upregulation in mice exposed to unflavored vape pens, and further upregulation (six-fold) with JUUL mint aerosol exposure. No changes were found in mice exposed to unflavored Mod device-generated aerosols. These findings suggest that specific vaping devices and components of e-liquids have an effect on ACE2 expression, thus potentially increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, exposure to e-cigarette aerosols both with and without nicotine led to alterations in eicosanoid lipid profiles within the BAL. These data demonstrate that chronic, daily inhalation of e-cigarette aerosols fundamentally alters the inflammatory and immune state of the lungs. Thus, e-cigarette vapers may be at higher risk of developing infections and inflammatory disorders of the lungs.

AB  - Since the first report on it in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world. Due to the lack of effective therapy available for COVID-19 patients, the identification of risk factors for the severe course of the disease is a matter of urgency. Therefore, the aim of this review was to report on evidence-based risk factors affecting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. We searched the PubMed database for current literature to identify relevant publications concerning risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Demographic and social factors (age, gender, race, in-center communities/nursing homes), clinical factors (smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases - CVD, chronic kidney disease - CKD, malignancies, dementia, cardiomyopathies, immunocompromised state), laboratory markers (C-reactive protein - CRP, leukocytosis, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase - LDH, aspartate aminotransferase - AST, procalcitonin, creatinine, lymphopenia, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor - G-CSF, also known as colony-stimulating factor 3 - CSF 3, interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 - IP-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 - MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha - MIP1A, tumor necrosis factor alpha - TNF-alpha), and genetic factors related to both the virus and the host were discussed. The identification of the potential risk factors affecting the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 may provide a chance for earlier and more effective management of COVID-19.

AB  - This study investigated the difficulties experienced by people suffering from depression in coping with the stressful context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown. Two large samples of the French population were classified on the basis of their depressive symptoms and completed an online questionnaire on their emotions and their behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that, compared to participants with no or mild mental health-related symptoms, participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms suffered from greater psychological effects of the pandemic and the lockdown (fear, anxiety, sadness, sleep quality, loss of daily routine). However, health risk behaviors (smoking, drinking, non-compliance with lockdown and barrier gestures) and perceived vulnerability did not differ between the participant groups, although more severely depressed participants tended to be less respectful of health guidelines. In addition, the most heightened effects on the depressed participants were boredom and the feeling of social isolation, which was not compensated by the search for social affiliation. Supporting people with depression should be a public health priority because they suffer psychologically more than others from the pandemic and the lockdown.

AB  - The electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), for many considered as a safe alternative to conventional cigarettes, has revolutionised the tobacco industry in the last decades. In e-cigarettes, tobacco combustion is replaced by e-liquid heating, leading some manufacturers to propose that e-cigarettes have less harmful respiratory effects than tobacco consumption. Other innovative features such as the adjustment of nicotine content and the choice of pleasant flavours have won over many users. Nevertheless, the safety of e-cigarette consumption and its potential as a smoking cessation method remain controversial due to limited evidence. Moreover, it has been reported that the heating process itself can lead to the formation of new decomposition compounds of questionable toxicity. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to better understand the impact of these new inhalable compounds on human health. Results of toxicological analyses suggest that e-cigarettes can be safer than conventional cigarettes, although harmful effects from short-term e-cigarette use have been described. Worryingly, the potential long-term effects of e-cigarette consumption have been scarcely investigated. In this review, we take stock of the main findings in this field and their consequences for human health including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - COVID-19 is an emerging viral disease affecting more than 200 countries worldwide and it present with varied clinical profile throughout the world. Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19. This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention. Public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use are also needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have presented immense challenges for health care systems. Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and use systems that effectively manage the demand for services., METHODS: This was a cohort study using electronic health records at a health care system in northeast Ohio that examined the effectiveness of the first 5 weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline including social care referrals for patients required to self-isolate. We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing., PARTICIPANTS: In 5 weeks, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers). Of these, 4213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). Mean age of callers was 42 years; 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid/uninsured., RESULTS: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 patients (7%) had a subsequent emergency department visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported, with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency department use (odds ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-16.39, P = .014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Patients with social needs and interest in receiving help were offered services to meet their needs including food deliveries (n = 92), behavioral health telephone visits (n = 49), and faith-based comfort calls from pastoral care personnel (n = 37)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of clinical and social needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers. <c2><a9> Copyright 2021 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of universal testing, effective therapies, or vaccines, identifying risk factors for viral infection, particularly readily modifiable exposures and behaviors, is required to identify effective strategies against viral infection and transmission., METHODS: We conducted a world-wide mobile application-based prospective cohort study available to English speaking adults with a smartphone. We collected self-reported characteristics, exposures, and behaviors, as well as smartphone-based geolocation data. Our main outcome was incident symptoms of viral infection, defined as fevers and chills plus one other symptom previously shown to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by daily surveys., FINDINGS: Among 14, 335 participants residing in all 50 US states and 93 different countries followed for a median 21 days (IQR 10-26 days), 424 (3%) developed incident viral symptoms. In pooled multivariable logistic regression models, female biological sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.39-2.20, p<0.001), anemia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.81, p = 0.001), hypertension (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.68, p = 0.007), cigarette smoking in the last 30 days (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35-2.55, p<0.001), any viral symptoms among household members 6-12 days prior (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.67-2.55, p<0.001), and the maximum number of individuals the participant interacted with within 6 feet in the past 6-12 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25, p<0.001) were each associated with a higher risk of developing viral symptoms. Conversely, a higher subjective social status (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, p<0.001), at least weekly exercise (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.70, p<0.001), and sanitizing one's phone (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99, p = 0.037) were each associated with a lower risk of developing viral symptoms., INTERPRETATION: While several immutable characteristics were associated with the risk of developing viral symptoms, multiple immediately modifiable exposures and habits that influence risk were also observed, potentially identifying readily accessible strategies to mitigate risk in the COVID-19 era.

AU  - Mamun, Mohammed A
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: Without integration of the available information, appropriate suicide preventive actions can be hindered. Therefore, this study attempts to review the Bangladeshi COVID-19-related suicide studies for the first time., Methods: For conducting a systematic review, the PRISMA guideline was adhered. Bangladeshi literatures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic related to either suicide case or suicidal behavior were identified within 1 to 10 April 2021, from the databases like PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc. Finally, a total of 9 literatures were included in this review., Results: Four literatures were cross-sectional studies assessing the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and the rest five were retrospective suicide studies concerned with either case study (n=3) or case-series study (n=2). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was identified to be ranging between 5% and 19.0%, whereas the rate increased over time of the pandemic inception. Significant risk factors concerning suicidal behavior included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic variables: female gender, being divorced or widows or widowers or single in marital status, having lower levels of education, being urban residence, belonging to higher socioeconomic class, being unemployed, and having no children, (ii) behavior and health-related variables: lack of physical exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol consuming, abnormal sleep status, more exposure to social media, and suffering from the higher number of physical health problems; (iii) COVID-19 pandemic-related variables: lower knowledge of COVID-19, lack of preventive COVID-19 behaviors, higher levels of COVID-19 fear, living in highly COVID-19 infected area, higher economic loss due to the pandemic, and experiencing relatives or acquaintances' death by the COVID-19; (iv) psychopathological variables: depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, suicidal thought history, suicide attempt history, and family with a history of suicide., Conclusion: Implementing cost-effective mental health strategies along with social and community awareness for increasing help-seeking behaviors of suicide risky individuals is highly suggested.

AB  - Developing an accurate and interpretable model to predict an individual's risk for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a critical step to efficiently triage testing and other scarce preventative resources. To aid in this effort, we have developed an interpretable risk calculator that utilized de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (UAB-i2b2) COVID-19 repository under the U-BRITE framework. The generated risk scores are analogous to commonly used credit scores where higher scores indicate higher risks for COVID-19 infection. By design, these risk scores can easily be calculated in spreadsheets or even with pen and paper. To predict risk, we implemented a Credit Scorecard modeling approach on longitudinal EHR data from 7,262 patients enrolled in the UAB Health System who were evaluated and/or tested for COVID-19 between January and June 2020. In this cohort, 912 patients were positive for COVID-19. Our workflow considered the timing of symptoms and medical conditions and tested the effects by applying different variable selection techniques such as LASSO and Elastic-Net. Within the two weeks before a COVID-19 diagnosis, the most predictive features were respiratory symptoms such as cough, abnormalities of breathing, pain in the throat and chest as well as other chronic conditions including nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder. When extending the timeframe to include all medical conditions across all time, our models also uncovered several chronic conditions impacting the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous and urinary organ systems. The whole pipeline of data processing, risk modeling and web-based risk calculator can be applied to any EHR data following the OMOP common data format. The results can be employed to generate questionnaires to estimate COVID-19 risk for screening in building entries or to optimize hospital resources.

AB  - Social distancing measures adopted in various countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to unwanted effects on their populations' health and behaviors. This study aimed to investigate smoking behavior in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze factors associated with the increase in cigarette consumption. An online survey was performed, and the final sample included 45,160 individuals. The study used post-stratification weights and calculated crude prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted by sex, age, and schooling, and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to analyze associations between increased cigarette consumption and sociodemographic variables and adherence to social distancing, quality of sleep, state of mind, and changes in work and earnings. Prevalence of smokers was 12% (95%CI: 11.1-12.9), 34% of whom reported an increase in cigarette consumption. The increase was greater among women (PR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.01-1.59) and individuals with incomplete secondary schooling (PR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.79). The increase in cigarette consumption was associated with worse quality of sleep, feeling isolated from family members or sad, depressed, or anxious, loss of earnings, and worse self-rated health. Health promotion strategies, smoking prevention, and encouragement for smoking cessation, as well as mental health interventions, should be continued and reinforced in the context of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes in the lifestyles of Brazilian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out with adolescents who participated in the survey "ConVid Adolescentes - Pesquisa de Comportamentos". The indicators related to lifestyles before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated: consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods, physical activity and sedentary behavior, smoking and consumption of alcohol. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the total population and according to sex and age group., RESULTS: A total of 9,470 adolescents participated in the study. During the period of social distancing, there was an increase in the prevalence of vegetables consumption (from 27.34 to 30.5%), frozen foods (from 13.26 to 17.3%), chocolates and sweets (from 48.58 to 52.51%), and time in front of screens (from 44.57 to 70.15%). On the other hand, there was a decrease in the practice of physical activity (from 28.70 to 15.74%) and in the consumption of alcohol (from 17.72 to 12.77%). Differences were observed according to sex and age group., CONCLUSION: The results show changes in the lifestyle of adolescents and an increase in health risk behaviors.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may lead to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which, in turn, may be associated with multiple organ dysfunction. In this review, we present advantages and disadvantages of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid from the cannabis plant, as a potential agent for the treatment of COVID-19. CBD has been shown to downregulate proteins responsible for viral entry and to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness against diseases of the respiratory system as well as its cardioprotective, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and anti-convulsant properties, that is, effects that may be beneficial for COVID-19. Only the latter two properties have been demonstrated in clinical studies, which also revealed anxiolytic and antinociceptive effects of CBD (given alone or together with DELTA9-tetrahydrocannabinol), which may be important for an adjuvant treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with COVID-19 and to limit post-traumatic stress symptoms. However, one should be aware of side effects of CBD (which are rarely serious), drug interactions (also extending to drugs acting against COVID-19) and the proper route of its administration (vaping may be dangerous). Clearly, further clinical studies are necessary to prove the suitability of CBD for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Shift work is associated with lung disease and infections. We therefore investigated the impact of shift work on significant COVID-19 illness., METHODS: 501 000 UK Biobank participants were linked to secondary care SARS-CoV-2 PCR results from Public Health England. Healthcare worker occupational testing and those without an occupational history were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression (age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation index) revealed that irregular shift work (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.92 to 3.05), permanent shift work (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.19), day shift work (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.6), irregular night shift work (OR 3.04, 95% CI 2.37 to 3.9) and permanent night shift work (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.7) were all associated with positive COVID-19 tests compared with participants that did not perform shift work. This relationship persisted after adding sleep duration, chronotype, premorbid disease, body mass index, alcohol and smoking to the model. The effects of workplace were controlled for in three ways: (1) by adding in work factors (proximity to a colleague combined with estimated disease exposure) to the multivariate model or (2) comparing participants within each job sector (non-essential, essential and healthcare) and (3) comparing shift work and non-shift working colleagues. In all cases, shift work was significantly associated with COVID-19. In 2017, 120 307 UK Biobank participants had their occupational history reprofiled. Using this updated occupational data shift work remained associated with COVID-19 (OR 4.48 (95% CI 1.8 to 11.18)., CONCLUSIONS: Shift work is associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital COVID-19 positivity. This risk could potentially be mitigated via additional workplace precautions or vaccination. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has caused disruptions in ongoing clinical trials and is expected to accelerate interest in conducting research studies remotely., OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, pre-COVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits., RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future., CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03262662; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03262662.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a variable degree of severity according to underlying comorbidities and life-style. Several research groups have reported an association between cigarette smoking and increased severity of COVID-19. The exact mechanism of action is largely unclear. We exposed low angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing human pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 epithelial cells to nicotine and assessed ACE2 expression at different times. We further used the nicotine-exposed cells in a virus neutralisation assay. Nicotine exposure induces rapid and long-lasting increases in gene and protein expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor ACE2, which in turn translates into increased competence for SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathic effect. These findings show that nicotine worsens SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection and have implications for public health policies. Copyright <c2><a9>The authors 2021.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is the main cell entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus playing a critical role in causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of smoking habit in the susceptibility to infection is still controversial. In this study we correlated lung ACE-2 gene expression with several clinical/pathological data to explore susceptibility to infection. This is a retrospective observational study on 29 consecutive COVID-19 autopsies. SARS-CoV-2 genome and ACE-2 mRNA expression were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in lung tissue samples and correlated with several data with focus on smoking habit. Smoking was less frequent in high than low ACE-2 expressors (p = 0.014). A Bayesian regression also including age, gender, hypertension, and virus quantity confirmed that smoking was the most probable risk factor associated with low ACE-2 expression in the model. A direct relation was found between viral quantity and ACE-2 expression (p = 0.028). Finally, high ACE-2 expressors more frequently showed a prevalent pattern of vascular injury than low expressors (p = 0.049). In conclusion, ACE-2 levels were decreased in the lung tissue of smokers with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results point out complex biological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 particularly concerning the aspect of smoking habit and need larger prospective case series and translational studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most desired solution to end the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are growing concerns that vaccine hesitancy would undermine its potential. We examined the intention to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the associated factors in a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong., METHODS: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/ no/ undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong., RESULTS: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%). Multivariable partial proportional odds model showed higher vaccine hesitancy in males, younger adults, those with no chronic disease, current smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers. After adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, inadequate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.63; P < 0.05) and lower perceived danger of COVID-19 (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.62 to 2.47; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy., CONCLUSIONS: In a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, only 45.3% of the participants intended to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when available. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with inadequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and lower perceived danger of COVID-19, which needed to be addressed to improve vaccination uptake.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an academic medical center in the southern United States., METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study of all adult patients (18 years and older) consecutively admitted with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection between March 13 and April 25, 2020 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed., RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black. On multivariate analysis, ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-28.6) and history of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.5-24.3) were associated with mortality, and those admitted from home were less likely to die (vs outside facility, OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.7). Neither age, sex, race, body mass index, insurance status, nor rural residence was independently associated with mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds evidence that Black patients appear to be overrepresented in those hospitalized with and those who die from COVID-19, likely a manifestation of adverse social determinants of health. These findings should help guide preventive interventions targeting groups at higher risk of acquiring and developing severe COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Restrictions of free movement have been proven effective in tackling the spread of COVID-19 disease. However, sensitive populations submitted to longer periods of restrictions may experience detrimental effects in significant areas of their lifestyle, such as sexual activity. This study examines sexual activity during the COVID-19 confinement in Spain. A survey distributed through an institutional social media profile served to collect data, whereas chi-squared tests, t-tests, analyses of variance, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to assess differences among sample subgroups. A total of 71.3% adults (N = 536) (72.8% female) reported engaging in sexual activity with a weekly average of 2.39 times (SD = 1.80), with significant differences favoring males, middle age, married/in a domestic relationship (p < 0.001), employed (p < 0.005), medium-high annual household income, living outside the Iberian Peninsula, and smoking and alcohol consumption. Analyses adjusted for the complete set of control variables showed significant odds for a lower prevalence of weekly sexual activity in women (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.72). Interventions to promote sexual activity in confined Spanish adults may focus on groups with lower sexual activity.

Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases)., RESULTS: From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5%, p<0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p<0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2%) HCWs with positive IgG levels. Declared exposure to a suspected/confirmed case was more frequently associated (p<0.001) with positive serology when the contact was a family member (19/94, 20.2%) than a patient or colleague (78/888, 8.8%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred undetected in a large fraction of HCWs and it was not associated with working in COVID-19 frontline areas. Beyond the hospital setting, exposure within the community represents an additional source of infection for HCWs. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have been associated with a reduction in inflammatory markers and improved endothelial function. Whether statins offer any benefit in COVID-19 needs to be elucidated., OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between antecedent statin use and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study on 1014 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes were mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care admission. Patients were classified into statin-users vs statin non-users based on antecedent use of statins. Multivariable regression analysis was performed adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, insurance, and comorbidities. Propensity score matching was performed to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort., RESULTS: A total of 1014 patients (Median age 65 (IQR 53-73); 530 (52.3%) males; 753 (74.3%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 (IQR 25.1-35.9); 615 (60.7%) with Medicare insurance) were included in the study. About 454 patients (44.77%) were using statins as home medication. Antecedent statin use was associated with significant decrease in mortality in the total cohort (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46 - 0.95; p = 0.03). Among the propensity score matched (PSM) cohort of 466 patients (233 statin users and 233 statin non-users), all the baseline characteristics had similar distribution among the two groups. Statin users had significant reduction in mortality in the PSM cohort as well (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 - 0.83; p = 0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Statin use was associated with significant reduction in mortality among COVID-19 patients. These findings support the pursuit of randomized clinical trials to explore the possible benefits of statins in COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 National Lipid Association.

AB  - Background: To understand a causal role of modifiable lifestyle factors in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression (a putative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] receptor) across 44 human tissues/organs, and in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity, we conducted a phenome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study., Methods: More than 500 genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to predict smoking and alcohol consumption. Inverse-variance weighted approach was adopted as the primary method to estimate a causal association, while MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were performed to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy., Results: We found that genetically predicted smoking intensity significantly increased ACE2 expression in thyroid (beta=1.468, p=1.8x10-8), and increased ACE2 expression in adipose, brain, colon, and liver with nominal significance. Additionally, genetically predicted smoking initiation significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 onset (odds ratio=1.14, p=8.7x10-5). No statistically significant result was observed for alcohol consumption., Conclusions: Our work demonstrates an important role of smoking, measured by both status and intensity, in the susceptibility to COVID-19., Funding: XJ is supported by research grants from the Swedish Research Council (VR-2018-02247) and Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE-2020-00884).

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global public health challenge. Most patients do not experience severe complications, but approximately 25% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the mortality rate is approximately 5-7%. Clinical findings have determined several risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19 patients, such as advanced age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases. Obesity is a common and serious health problem worldwide that initiates a cascade of disorders, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of these disorders is linked to a more severe course of COVID-19. Given the "epidemic" of obesity worldwide and the importance of obesity in the progression of COVID-19, we investigated the mechanisms through which obesity increases the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 to support the selection of more appropriate therapies for individuals with obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention., METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it., RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03874585; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03874585., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1186/s13722-020-00187-6.

AB  - Importance: Low vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association., Objective: To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection., Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021., Exposures: Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency use-authorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses., Results: The 18148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods. Their median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-56) years, 12170 (67.1%) were women, 900 (5.0%) were seropositive, 4498 (24.8%) had a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, and 10876 (59.9%) had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before the pandemic. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking status, and geographical location, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL before (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22) or during (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.09) the pandemic; it was also not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.93-1.27) or during (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91-1.23) the pandemic. Similar results were observed in propensity score analyses. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was associated with obesity (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.46), not having a college degree (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.62), and Asian (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13-1.87), Black (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.25-3.34), Hispanic (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.15-3.27), American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (OR, 2.01; OR, 1.54-2.62) race/ethnicity, and was inversely associated with high blood pressure (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96), smoking (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.78), and residing in the US Northeast (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92) and West (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.67)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with low levels of vitamin D independently of other risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between early inflammation indicators and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 17 to February 14, 2020 were enrolled. The general information, chest CT before admission, the first laboratory parameters and chest CT within 24 hours after admission were collected. Patients were followed up for 30 days after the first onset of dyspnea or pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed more than 50% within 24 to 48 hours (according to the criteria for severe cases) as the study endpoint. According to the endpoint, the patients were divided into two groups: mild type/common type group and severe/critical group, and the differences in general information and inflammation index of the two groups were compared. Logistic regression was used to analyze the inflammation index and the severity of COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was draw to evaluate the predictive value of early inflammation indicators for severe/critical in patients with COVID-19., RESULTS: A total of 140 patients with COVID-19 were included, 74 males and 66 females; the average age was (45+/-14) years old; 6 cases (4.3%) of mild type, 107 cases (76.4%) of common type, and 22 cases (15.7%) of severe type, 5 cases (3.6%) were critical. There were significantly differences in ages (years old: 43+/-13 vs. 57+/-13), the proportion of patients with one chronic disease (17.7% vs. 55.6%), C-reactive protein [CRP (mg/L): 7.3 (2.3, 21.0) vs. 40.1 (18.8, 62.6)], lymphocyte count [LYM (x109/L): 1.3 (1.0, 1.8) vs. 0.8 (0.7, 1.1)], the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio [NLR: 2.1 (1.6, 3.0) vs. 3.1 (2.2, 8.8)] and multilobularinltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension and age [MuLBSTA score: 5.0 (3.0, 5.0) vs. 5.0 (5.0, 7.0)] between mild/common group and severe/critical group (all P < 0.05). Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP, NLR, MuLBSTA score, age, and whether chronic diseases were associated with the severity of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were 1.037 (1.020-1.055), 1.374 (1.123-1.680), 1.574 (1.296-1.911), 1.082 (1.042-1.125), 6.393 (2.551-16.023), respectively, all P < 0.01]. Further multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CRP and MuLBSTA score were risk factors for the development of COVID-19 to severe/critical cases [OR and 95%CI were 1.024 (1.002-1.048) and 1.321 (1.027-1.699) respectively, both P < 0.05]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for CRP and MuLBSTA score to predict severe/critical cases were both 0.818, and the best cut-off points were 27.4 mg/L and 6.0 points, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: CRP and MuLBSTA score are related to the severity of COVID-19, and may have good independent predictive ability for the development of severe/critical illness.

Severe cases were potentially associated with advanced age (Standard Mean Difference (SMD) = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.34-2.12), male gender (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI:1.33-1.71), obesity (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44-2.46), history of smoking (OR = 1.40, 95% CI:1.06-1.85), hypertension (OR = 2.42, 95% CI: 2.03-2.88), diabetes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.98-2.91), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 2.22-3.71), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.63-5.41), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.54-3.97), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.89-4.38), malignancy (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.00-3.40), and chronic liver disease (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.17). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 39.59, 95% CI: 19.99-78.41), shock (OR = 21.50, 95% CI: 10.49-44.06) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 8.84, 95% CI: 4.34-18.00) were most likely to prevent recovery. In summary, patients with severe conditions had a higher rate of comorbidities and complications than patients with non-severe conditions., CONCLUSION: Patients who were male, with advanced age, obesity, a history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, malignancy, coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease, COPD, or CKD are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms. ARDS, shock and AKI were thought to be the main hinderances to recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory epithelium expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), pathogen of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, although a few recent studies have found different ACE2 expression in lung tissue of smokers. The effect of smoking on ACE2 expression and COVID-19 is still not clear. So, we did this research to determine the effect of smoking on ACE2 expression pattern and its relationship with the risk and severity of COVID-19., METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients with smoking and non-smoking were analyzed, and ACE2 expression of respiratory and digestive mucosa epithelia from smoker and non-smoker patients or healthy subjects were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining., RESULTS: Of all 295 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, only 24 (8.1%) were current smokers with moderate smoking or above, which accounted for 54.2% of severe cases with higher mortality than non-smokers (8.3% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.018). Data analysis showed the proportion of smokers in COVID-19 patients was lower than that in general population of China (Z = 11.65, P < 0.001). IHC staining showed ACE2 expression in respiratory and digestive epithelia of smokers were generally downregulated., CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of smokers in COVID-19 patients was lower, which may be explained by ACE2 downregulation in respiratory mucosa epithelia. However, smoking COVID-19 patients accounted for a higher proportion in severe cases and higher mortality than for non-smoking COVID-19 patients, which needs to be noted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular prevalence is high in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, whether racial disparities exist among this population have not been systematically explored., METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to assess the prevalence of stroke stratified by race among patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 who visited emergency department (ED) up to August 13, 2020 in the United States (US). We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of stroke in Black patients with COVID-19 compared to their non-Black counterparts while adjusting for the major potential confounders., RESULTS: Among 8815 patients with ED visits with COVID-19, 77 (0.87%), 95% confidence interval CI (95% CI): 0.69% to 1.10%) had ischemic stroke. The mean age of patients with stroke was 64 years (SD: 2 years); 28 (43%) were men, 55 (71%) had hypertension, and 29 (50%) were Black. The prevalence of ischemic stroke in Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics was 1.26% (95% CI: 0.86% to 1.83%), 0.84% (95% CI: 0.51% to 1.37%) and 0.49% (95% CI: 0.26% to 0.88%) respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, drinking and smoking, the likelihood of stroke was higher in Black than non-Black patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.13 to 7.15, p=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in the prevalence of stroke among patients with COVID-19 exist, higher in Black population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serological assays detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being widely deployed in studies and clinical practice. However, the duration and effectiveness of the protection conferred by the immune response remains to be assessed in population-based samples. To estimate the incidence of newly acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in seropositive individuals as compared to seronegative controls we conducted a retrospective longitudinal matched study., METHODS: A seroprevalence survey including a representative sample of the population was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland between April and June 2020, immediately after the first pandemic wave. Seropositive participants were matched one-to-two to seronegative controls, using a propensity-score including age, gender, immunodeficiency, BMI, smoking status and education level. Each individual was linked to a state-registry of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our primary outcome was confirmed infections occurring from serological status assessment to the end of the second pandemic wave (January 2021)., RESULTS: Among 8344 serosurvey participants, 498 seropositive individuals were selected and matched with 996 seronegative controls. After a mean follow-up of 35.6 (SD 3.2) weeks, 7 out of 498 (1.4%) seropositive subjects had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, of whom 5 (1.0%) were classified as reinfections. In contrast, the infection rate was higher in seronegative individuals (15.5%, 154/996) during a similar follow-up period (mean 34.7 [SD 3.2] weeks), corresponding to a 94% (95%CI 86% to 98%, P<0.001) reduction in the hazard of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for seropositives., CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protection against reinfection lasting at least 8 months. These findings could help global health authorities establishing priority for vaccine allocation. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We explored the role of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 incidence among cancer patients during the first wave of the pandemic. We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95%CI 3.8-5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aimed to evaluate the association between smoking and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted using a large nationwide database. The case group included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the control group was randomly sampled from the general Korean population in the National Health Insurance Service database by matching sex, age, and region of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status., RESULTS: A total of 4,167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20,937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.62). When ex-smokers and current smokers were analysed separately, similar results were obtained (current smoker OR = 0.33, CI = 0.28-0.38; ex-smoker OR = 0.81, CI = 0.72-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that smoking may not be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking tends to lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution., IMPLICATIONS: It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019. In this large nationwide study in South Korea, smoking tended to lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further confirmatory studies are required. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers' perception regarding COVID-19 exposure in a work unit. Workers' depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-9 (SAVE-9) scale. We found that work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was associated with female sex, perception of the workplace as being dangerous, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were associated with male sex, young age, depression, and insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.

AU  - Lee, Alvin J X

PY  - 2021
AB  - The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020 has caused oncology teams around the world to adapt their practice in the aim of protecting patients. Early evidence from China indicated that patients with cancer, and particularly those who had recently received chemotherapy or surgery, were at increased risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many registries of cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 emerged during the first wave. We collate the evidence from these national and international studies and focus on the risk factors for patients with solid cancers and the contribution of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT-chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormone therapy) to outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients with cancer infected with SARS-Cov-2 have a higher probability of death compared with patients without cancer. Common risk factors for mortality following COVID-19 include age, male sex, smoking history, number of comorbidities and poor performance status. Oncological features that may predict for worse outcomes include tumour stage, disease trajectory and lung cancer. Most studies did not identify an association between SACT and adverse outcomes. Recent data suggest that the timing of receipt of SACT may be associated with risk of mortality. Ongoing recruitment to these registries will enable us to provide evidence-based care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The respiratory system involvement is the most common presentation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, other organs including the central nervous system (CNS) could be affected by the virus. Strokes, seizures, change in mental status, and encephalitis have been reported as the neurological manifestation of the disease. We hypothesized that COVID-19 could predispose younger patients to spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The present study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 has any relationship with the occurrence of spontaneous ICH in young or not., METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all the patients with spontaneous ICH who were referred to our center between 20 Feb and 1 Sep 2020. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory test data were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups. The COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative ones. All the variables including age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume and location, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, the length of hospital stay, the lab test results and the clinical outcome at last visit or discharge as Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: There were 22 COVID-19 positive patients (20.8%) and 84 COVID-19 negative ones (79.2%). The mean age of the patients in the case group (54.27 +/- 4.67) was significantly lower than that in the control group (69.88 +/- 4.47) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, our results showed a significant difference between the two groups based on the presence of chronic arterial hypertension (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups based on gender, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hematoma volume, need for surgery, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, platelet count, Prothrombin Time (PT), and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that COVID positive patients with ICH are younger and with less predisposing factors than COVID negative subjects with ICH.

AU  - Lallai, Valeria

PY  - 2021
AB  - Evidence in humans suggests a correlation between nicotine smoking and severe respiratory symptoms with COVID-19 infection. In lung tissue, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears to mechanistically underlie viral entry. Here, we investigated whether e-cigarette vapor inhalation alters ACE2 and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in male and female mice. In male lung, nicotine vapor inhalation induced a significant increase in ACE2 mRNA and protein, but surprisingly, these differences were not found in females. Further, both vehicle and nicotine vapor inhalation downregulated alpha5 nAChR subunits in both sexes, while differences were not found in alpha7 nAChR subunit expression. Finally, blood ACE2 levels did not differ with exposure, indicating that blood sampling is not a sufficient indicator of lung ACE2 changes. Together, these data indicate a direct link between e-cigarette vaping and increased ACE2 expression in male lung tissue, which thereby reveals an underlying mechanism of increased vulnerability to coronavirus infection in individuals vaping nicotine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze adherence to the Mediterranean diet among the adult general population of Cyprus during the COVID-19 confinement., METHODS: This was an Internet-based, cross-sectional study that collected information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and other dietary details, physical activity levels, and smoking habits using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 6 and June 20, 2020, 1 to 2.5 mo after the initiation of the social confinement measures., RESULTS: There were 1485 Cypriot adults who participated in the study. The median Mediterranean diet score was 21 (q1 = 19, q3 = 24) with men, married individuals, residents of rural regions, and physically active participants being more adherent to the Mediterranean diet compared with women; unmarried, divorced, or widowed; residents of urban regions; and physically inactive participants, respectively (P < 0.05). Multinomial logistic regression showed that being >=45 y of age and physically active was positively associated with the Mediterranean diet score, whereas being unmarried, divorced, or widowed and a current smoker was negatively associated with the Mediterranean diet score (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet during the confinement imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic among the Cypriot adult population was associated with male sex, age >45 y, being married, being physically active, and being resident of rural regions. The importance of better understanding of nutritional behavior during COVID-19 lockdowns is emphasized so public health authorities can plan future lockdown policies on nutritional recommendations, should a new pandemic occur.

This was an internet-based cross-sectional study conducted between 6 April and 20 June 2020, one to two and a half months after the introduction of and the first mandatory lockdown on its entire territory imposed by the government of the Republic of Cyprus on 24 March 2020. Data collection was done using a self-administered questionnaire that included information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, physical activity, smoking habits, and stress level. A total of 1,485 adults participated in the study. The median perceived stress score was 10 (q1 = 6, q3 = 15). Linear regression models showed that having a medium monthly income (501-1,500) and being a current smoker was positively associated with the perceived stress score, while being male and physically active was negatively associated with the perceived stress score (all p <0.05). People with medium average salary and current smokers were at a higher risk for perceived stress. Psychological interventions and/or psychological services provided in certain vulnerable groups would be beneficial in future lockdowns due to either COVID-19 or a new pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is creating severe issues for healthcare and broad social structures, exposing societal vulnerabilities. Among the populations affected by COVID-19 are people engaged in substance use, such as people who smoke; vape (e-cigarette use); use opioids, cannabis, alcohol, or psychoactive prescription drugs; or have a substance use disorder (SUD). Monitoring substance use and SUD during the pandemic is essential, as people who engage in substance use or present with SUD are at greater risk for COVID-19, and the economic and social changes resulting from the pandemic may aggravate SUD. There have been several reviews focused on COVID-19 in relation to substance use and SUD. Reviews generally did not consider on a large range of substance use variants or SUDs. We plan a scoping review that seeks to fill gaps in our current understanding of substance use and SUD, in the COVID-19 era., METHODS: A scoping review focused on substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19, will be conducted. We will search (from January 2020 onwards) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Global Health, WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease Database, WHO Global Index Medicus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Middle Eastern Central Asian Studies, CINAHL Complete, and Sociological Abstracts. Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, HSRProj, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., ClinicalTrial.gov , World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and International Standard Randomized Con-trolled Trial Number registry). Study selection will conform to Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies investigating substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19 in all populations and settings, will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods., DISCUSSION: Original research is urgently needed to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 on substance use and SUD. The planned scoping review will help to address this gap., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework (osf/io/tzgm5).

AB  - Objectives. To determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected e-cigarette use among young people in the United States. Methods. Data came from a weekly cross-sectional online survey of youths and young adults (aged 15-24 years). Logistic regression analyses measured odds of past-30-day e-cigarette use (n = 5752) following widespread stay-at-home directives (March 14-June 29, 2020), compared with the pre-COVID-19 period (January 1-March 13, 2020). Logistic regression among a subsample of current e-cigarette users (n = 779) examined factors associated with reduced use following stay-at-home orders. Results. Odds of current e-cigarette use were significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-COVID-19 period among youths aged 15 to 17 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54, 0.96) and young adults aged 18 to 20 years (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52, 0.81). E-cigarette users with reduced access to retail environments had higher odds of reporting reduced e-cigarette use (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.14). Conclusions. COVID-19 stay-at-home directives present barriers to e-cigarette access and are associated with a decline in e-cigarette use among young people. Public Health Implications. Findings support the urgent implementation of interventions that reduce underage access to e-cigarettes to accelerate a downward trajectory of youth and young adult e-cigarette use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In April 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and infection control measures, including requests to work from home and stay-at-home restrictions, were introduced. This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency., METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates., RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men: PR 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.62) and participants aged >=65 years: PR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.92-3.12) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men: PR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93 and participants >=65 years: PR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.49). Additionally, respondents working from home or living alone had significantly higher PR for increased smoking (working from home: PR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.41 and living alone: PR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.38) and respondents who changed from cigarettes to heated tobacco products (HTPs) had significantly lower PR for quitting smoking (PR 0.150; 95% CI, 0.039-0.582)., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.

AB  - The "Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19)" caused by "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)" is still active all over the world as a pandemia. It is reported that at least 7000 health care workers (HCW) had lost their lives due to COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemia till September 2020 in the world. In our country between the dates, March 11, 2020 which the first case was reported, and September 1, 2020, the date which our study has been finalized, 7428 HCW were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 52 of them were deceased. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the contact and illness of healthcare workers working outside of the pandemic clinics in our hospital and to examine the possible transmission routes and disease prognoses. Healthcare workers who were working outside the pandemic service between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 and who had a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and all hospital staff who had contacted with these people, and HCW who had contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 while receiving inpatient treatment in services other than the pandemic service was evaluated and classified as low, medium and high risk according to the risk scoring defined in the published "Ministry of Health COVID-19 Guidelines". Healthcare workers who were evaluated as contacted were questioned in detail regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of contact, especially suitability of the masks, contact time and shape and all the data were recorded. A total of 53 index cases (40 HCW and 13 inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19) were detected during the study period. The number of HCW contacted with these index cases was 672. In our study, we examined the data of 40 index cases and 672 contacted HCW (total of 712 HCW). Only 3 of 40 index cases (7.5%) had hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, the other 37 cases were infected by community sources. COVID-19 was not detected in 94.2% of the contacted HCW during the follow-up while 5.8% of them had positive PCR test results. Considering the possible way of contamination among the contacted HCW who developed COVID-19 during the follow-up period, it was determined that 13.1% of the cases were a result of taken care of patients, 86.9% of the cases were a result of being in hospital social environments (drinking tea, smoking, eating, chatting in the same room without personal precautions) and in the days after the contact, it was in the form of contact with healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19. When the contacted HCW were questioned about using proper masks at the time of contact, we determined that 93.3% of them used masks during patient caring procedures, however, only 48.9% used masks when they were in social areas (p<0.001). Healthcare workers face an unprecedented risk of occupational disease and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also observed that prolonged pandemia period caused health workers to disregard rigorous infection control precautions in social areas of hospitals which they follow inpatient care although this has shown to be the most common way of contamination. Commonly performed in-service training and causing awareness in all areas of the hospital about following infection control precautions and PPE usage and checking the process regularly are the most important ways to prevent HCW from being affected by COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Similar to other countries, the government of Germany has implemented various restrictions of social life in March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This results in millions of people being isolated for long periods, which may increase feelings of worry and anxiety. As the consumption of alcohol and tobacco is an often used dysfunctional strategy to cope with such feelings, these restrictions might cause an increase of consumption. Already at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown can increase the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the future. However, up to now little is known about the changes in alcohol-drinking behavior and tobacco smoking in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: To address this theme, we investigated the changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption in the German population aged between 18 and 80 years via an online survey., RESULTS: In total, 3,245 persons participated in the survey; 35.5% of them reported an increase in drinking during the lockdown (42.9% did not change their drinking behavior, 21.3% drank less, and 0.3% started drinking). The odds of consuming more alcohol during lockdown were associated with middle age, higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lower agreement with the importance of the restrictions, and consuming alcohol more than once per week before the lockdown. Also, 45.8% of the participants increased their smoking during the lockdown. The odds of smoking more during lockdown were associated with higher subjective stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is important to start campaigns to inform the general population about potential long-term effects of increased alcohol and tobacco consumption and to raise the health-care professionals' awareness of this topic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread adoption of virus control measures have inevitably disrupted efforts to address lifestyle risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCD). This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on all lifestyle medicine pillars, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social support and use of risky substances., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults who resided in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire comprised of six validated tools regarding the following lifestyle behaviours before and during lockdown: adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stress and social support levels, sleep pattern and use of risky substances such as smoking and alcohol. Paired before and during lockdown comparisons for each lifestyle pillar were undertaken using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Bowker symmetry Test where response was numerical (non-parametric data) and categorical respectively. Furthermore, stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were performed., RESULTS: Out of 745 participants, 74% were female and median age was 39 years. Overall participants reported significantly higher perceived stress score (22 v 25, p < 0.01), lower social support score (71 v 68, p < 0.001), and worse sleep quality score (4 v 5, p < 0.01) during lockdown. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence was moderate and increased significantly only in those practicing religious fasting (score of 6 v 7, p < 0.01). Total minutes spent sitting increased (120 v 180, p < 0.01) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change. Smoking intensity increased during lockdown whilst frequency of alcohol consumption decreased (ptrend = 0.03 and < 0.01, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Various lifestyle factors were adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in Cyprus. Evidence from this study supports development of holistic lifestyle interventions during and following the pandemic to reduce short and long-term NCD risks by building on lifestyle behaviour strengths and addressing longstanding and emerging gaps and needs.

AB  - Changes in the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic in England may exacerbate existing health inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Cross-sectional data came from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) between April-July in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month distress across 2016/2017 and 2020, and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristics in 2016/2017 and 2020. Between the combined April-July 2016 and 2017 sample and April-July 2020 the prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers increased (2016/2017: moderate 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe 8.23%, 7.16-9.47; 2020: moderate 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR = 2.16, 1.13-4.07). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate distress and older age groups (65+ years) increases in severe distress. There were increases of moderate distress among more disadvantaged social grades and both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Between April-July 2016/2017 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress among smokers differed between 2016/2017 and 2020 and represents a widening of inequalities. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care., METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables., RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5degreeC, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points)., CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.

PY  - 2021
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most adults who use electronic cigarettes (ECs) also smoke combustible cigarettes (CCs). Quitting ECs appears common among dual users but little is known regarding adult dual users' motivations and methods to quit ECs or how this relates to quitting CCs., METHODS: We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, a web-based crowd-sourcing service, to survey 366 US adults with a history of regular EC and CC use. This analysis examined motivations and methods to quit both products among a subset of 204 (55.7%) respondents with dual use and a history of one or more attempts to quit ECs., RESULTS: Most respondents (95%) were using ECs at the time of this survey and had a lifetime median of five EC quit attempts. The most common motivations to quit ECs were health (74%), money/cost (45%), and to reduce risk of COVID-19 (25%). The most common EC quit methods were cutting down (68%), getting advice from a doctor (28%), quitting 'cold turkey' (24%), nicotine replacement therapy (24%), and switching to ECs with less nicotine (24%). Most motivations and methods to quit ECs and CCs were moderately to highly correlated, suggesting similarity in dual users' approach to quitting the two products., CONCLUSIONS: Dual users had a range of motivations and methods to quit ECs, most of which were similar to their motivations and methods to quit CCs. These findings support the need to develop treatment for adults motivated to quit ECs and demonstrate that dual users may currently engage in similar strategies to quit both products.

AB  - AIM: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety and depression status of prostate cancer (PCa) patients whose planned operations in the urology clinic of our hospital, which is serving as a pandemic hospital in Turkey have been postponed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic., METHODS: This survey study was conducted at urology clinic of Ankara City Hospital between March 1 and June 1, 2020, and included 24 male patients who agreed to answer the questionnaires (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] I and II and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Demographical and clinical data (age, time since diagnosis, total serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, risk groups according to the D'Amico classification system, smoking, alcohol habitus, major surgical history and comorbidities) of the patients were collected from hospital software., RESULTS: The mean STAI-I score of the patients (46.7 +/- 1.4 [44-49]) was significantly higher than their STAI-II score (41.7 +/- 2.4 [39-47]) (P < .001). The negative correlation between the decrease in age and STAI-I score was found to be statistically significant (r = 0.439, P < .05). The mean BDI score of the patients was 4.3 +/- 3.2 (0-13), which was compatible with mild depression. There was no statistically significant difference among the time elapsed from diagnosis, PSA levels, smoking and alcohol habitus, major surgical history and comorbidity status and STAI-I, STAI-II and BDI scores (P > .05)., CONCLUSION: Prostate cancer patients with postponed operations should be guided properly in order to manage their anxiety status especially young patients.

AB  - Cardiometabolic disease describes a combination of metabolic abnormalities that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including pathological changes such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and hypertension (HTN), and environmental risk factors such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and poverty. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients continues to rise, T2DM, CVD, HTN, and obesity, all components of, or sequelae of cardiometabolic disease, were identified among others as key risk factors associated with increased mortality in these patients. Numerous studies have been done to further elucidate this relationship between COVID-19 and cardiometabolic disease. Cardiometabolic disease is associated with both increased susceptibility to COVID-19 and worse outcomes of COVID-19, including intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and death. The proinflammatory state of cardiometabolic disease specifically obesity, has been associated with a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. There has been no evidence to suggest that antihypertensives and antidiabetic medications should be discontinued in COVID-19 patients but these patients should be closely monitored to ensure that their blood pressure and blood glucose levels are stable. Assessment of vaccination efficacy in cardiometabolic disease patients is also discussed. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people across the globe. Previous coronavirus outbreaks led to worsened symptoms amongst pregnant women, suggesting that pregnant women are at greater risk., OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to investigate the differences in clinical presentation, management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in pregnant and non-pregnant women., METHODS: We ran a search on electronic databases and analysis of the relevant articles was done using Revie Manager 5.4., RESULTS: The review consists of nine studies comprising 591,058 women (28,797 pregnant and 562,261 non-pregnant), with most of the data derived from two large studies. The risk of experiencing fever (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64-0.85), headache (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.74-0.79), myalgia (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89-0.95), diarrhea (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.39-0.43), chest tightness (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77-0.95), and expectoration (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21-0.97) were greater amongst non-pregnant COVID-19-infected women. Pregnant women with COVID-19 were less likely to be obese (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.63-0.73) or have a smoking history (RR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.26-0.39). COVID-19-infected non-pregnant women had a higher frequency of comorbidity such as chronic cardiac disease (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.44-0.77), renal disease (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.29-0.71), and malignancy (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.98), compared to COVID-19-infected pregnant women. The risk of ICU admission (RR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.68-3.05) and requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (RR: 2.68; 95% CI: 2.07-3.47) were significantly higher amongst pregnant women., CONCLUSIONS: Although the frequency of risk factors and the risk of experiencing clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were higher among non-pregnant women, COVID-19-infected pregnant women had a higher requirement of ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-pregnant COVID-19-infected women. More well-conducted studies from varying contexts are needed to draw conclusions. Prospero registration: CRD42020204638.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Delayed second dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trades maximal effectiveness for a lower level of immunity across more of the population. We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine., DESIGN: Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared with a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin alpha4beta7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody assay 3-10 weeks after vaccination, in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates (defined by a cut-off of 15 U/mL), and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine., RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL (5.9) vs 28.8 U/mL (5.4) p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL (4.9)) vs 13.8 U/mL (5.9) p<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab-treated compared with vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change (FC) 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.40), p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.51), p<0.0001) vaccines. In both models, age >=60 years, immunomodulator use, Crohn's disease and smoking were associated with lower, while non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine., CONCLUSION: Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN45176516. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoking is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiopulmonary diseases. Additionally, smokers are highly susceptible to infectious agents due to weakened immunity. However, the progression of lung injury based on SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 pathogenesis amongst smokers and those with pre-existing pulmonary diseases is not known. We determined the systemic levels and activity of COVID-19 associated proteins, cytokine/chemokines, and lipid mediators (lipidomics) amongst COVID-19 patients with and without a history of smoking to understand the underlying susceptible factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Methods: We obtained serum from healthy (CoV-), COVID-19 positive (CoV+), and COVID-19 recovered (CoV Rec) subjects with and without a history of smoking. We conducted a Luminex multiplex assay (cytokine levels), LC/MS (eicosanoids or oxylipin panel), and ACE2 enzymatic activity assays on the serum samples to determine the systemic changes in COVID-19 patients. Results: On comparing the levels of serum ACE2 amongst COVID-19 (positive and recovered) patients and healthy controls, we found a pronounced increase in serum ACE2 levels in patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, ACE2 enzyme activity was significantly increased amongst COVID-19 patients with a smoking history. Also, we analyzed the levels of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7) peptide, the product of enzymatic action of ACE2, in the serum samples. We found significantly high levels of Ang1-7 in the serum of both CoV+ and CoV Rec patients. Our data further demonstrated a smoking-induced increase in serum furin and inflammatory cytokine [IFNgamma(p = 0.0836), Eotaxin (p < 0.05), MCP-1 (p < 0.05), and IL-9 (p = 0.0991)] levels in COVID-19 patients as compared to non-smoking controls. Overall, our results show that smoking adversely affects the levels of systemic inflammatory markers and COVID-19 associated proteins, thus suggesting that COVID-19 infection may have severe outcomes amongst smokers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactivation of herpes family viruses in immunocompromised patients may result in detrimental outcomes for the hosts; therefore, herpes simplex virus-1 and varicella zoster virus infections in the context of COVID-19 may have clinical and prognostic implications. Several reports associated this human herpes virus with COVID-19 infection and have claimed that it can be an indicator for latent COVID-19 infection. However, since most of these were case reports, it is impossible to assess the prevalence of these associations., METHODS: The University of Florida patient registry i2b2 with ICD-10 diagnosis codes was used for retrieval of patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 and each of the other viruses over the period of October 2015-June 2020., RESULTS: The prevalence of the herpes simplex-1 occurrence in the COVID-19 group was 2.81% compared to 0.77% in the hospital population odds ratio of 5.27. When adjusted for gender, race, and age, the odds were 5.18, 4.48, and 4.61, respectively. After adjustment for respiratory disease, endocrine disease, obesity, diabetes, circulatory disease, and smoking, the odds were 1.94, 3.18, 1.37, 3.54, 3.7, and 5.1, respectively. The prevalence of the varicella zoster virus in COVID-19 patients was 1.8% compared to 0.43% in the hospital population, odds ratio of 5.26 before adjustment, and 5.2, 5.47, and 4.76 after adjusting for gender, age, and race, respectively. When adjusted for respiratory disease, endocrine disease, obesity, diabetes, and circulatory and neurological diseases, the odds were 1.3, 2.2, 1.48, 2.33, 2.85, and 2.6, respectively., CONCLUSION: Herpes simplex-1 and varicella zoster viruses are strongly associated with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression., METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants., RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections., CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.

AB  - Anosmia and ageusia are the first and maybe the only symptom in patients affected with COVID-19 especially if the patient is paucisymptomatic. This aim of this study was to determine the demographic details of patients with anosmia, prevalence of anosmia and the time taken for it to resolve in patients who are positive for COVID-19 and took treatment in our hospital. Cross Sectional Study. Patients with real time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. The study group was interviewed through telephonic calls and a questionnaire filled to see the development and regression of their symptoms. Of the study population of 1000, 742 patients had some sort of a smell disturbance. There was a positive correlation between the severity of the disease and history of smoking. The prevalence of smell disturbances among COVID-19 patients in our study was 74.2%. One important finding that we found out was that majority of the smokers had moderate disease. Most of the patients had complete recovery form smell disturbance in the due course of time. The mean time for resolution of smell disturbance was found to be 9.89 days. Anosmia and ageusia can represent the only symptomatology present in patients with COVID-19 and they are completely reversible and hence they can be used as early predictors of infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Grip strength is one of the main components for the physical functioning in sarcopenia and physical frailty., OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19., METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the gender-specific peak mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation <=90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score <=11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings., RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the well-known independent risk factors (i.e. age, obesity, COPD, and CRP level), low grip strength independently increased (about three times) the severity of COVID-19.

AB  - AIMS: To explore i) associations between vaping and self-reported diagnosed/suspected Covid-19; ii) changes in vaping since Covid-19 and factors associated with these changes; iii) whether Covid-19 motivated current or recent ex-vapers to quit., METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 2791 UK adults recruited 30/04/2020-14/06/2020. Participants self-reported data on sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosed/suspected Covid-19, vaping status, changes in vaping and motivation to quit vaping since Covid-19., RESULTS: There were no differences in diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 between never, current and ex-vapers. Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out small negative (protective) associations between vaping status and diagnosed/suspected Covid-19. Among current vapers (n = 397), 9.7 % (95 % CI 6.8-12.6 %) self-reported vaping less than usual since Covid-19, 42.0 % (37.2-46.9 %) self-reported vaping more, and 48.3 % (43.4-53.2 %) self-reported no change. In adjusted analyses, vaping less was associated with being female (aOR = 3.40, 95 % CI 1.73-6.71), not living with children (aOR = 4.93, 1.15-21.08) and concurrent smoking (aOR = 8.77, 3.04-25.64), while vaping more was associated with being younger (aOR = 5.26, 1.37-20.0), living alone (aOR = 2.08, 1.14-3.85), and diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 (aOR = 4.72, 2.60-8.62). Of current vapers, 32.2 % (95 % CI 27.5-36.8 %) were motivated to quit vaping since Covid-19, partly motivated by Covid-19, and 21.0 %, (10.5-31.4 %) of recent ex-vapers quit vaping due to Covid-19., CONCLUSIONS: Among UK adults, self-reported diagnosed/suspected Covid-19 was not associated with vaping status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syria has suffered for nine years from a conflict that left over 11.1 million inhabitants in need of humanitarian assistance and over 80% in poverty. A ten-week-long full lockdown was enforced in Syria and successfully minimized the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to estimate the occurrence of mental health disorders after lockdown termination among the citizens of war-torn Syria., METHODS: Online questionnaires, which included demographic and war-related questions, Dimensions of Anger Reactions 5 (DAR-5) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were distributed to different social media groups., RESULTS: This study recruited 1445 participants, of which 515 (35.6%) were males, the mean age was 24.8 +/- 6.3 years, 38% had problematic anger, 64% had moderate to very severe depression, 42.9% had moderate to severe anxiety and 39.7% had moderate to severe stress. Increased living expenses, not being able to go out and a reduced ability to earn income and provide food were significantly associated with the psychological burden after the lockdown (p < 0.05). The association of war variables with mental disorders was weaker than the effect of the deteriorating economy. Other healthcare workers had more severe distress than doctors, who themselves were found to have less distress than the general population (p < 0.05). Anger scores were approximately equal, regardless of the type of work. Finally, shisha smoking was associated with worse mental health (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The psychological burden of the damaged economy surpassed the direct damage due to COVID-19 and the effect of years of conflict. Urgent interventions are required, as this burden may continue for years, if not for decades. A full lockdown in countries with fragile economies may delay the spread of the virus, but it will severely damage the economy, which will lead to a deterioration of the mental health of their citizens.

AB  - Background: Lockdown restrictions due to COVID-19 have affected many people's lifestyles and ability to earn a living. They add further distress to the lives of people in Syria, who have already endured 9 years of war. This study evaluates distress and the major causes of concerns related to COVID-19 during the full lockdown. Methods: Online questionnaires were distributed using SPTSS, K10, and MSPSS which were used with other demographic, war- and COVID-19-related questions that were taken from The (CRISIS) V0.1 Adult Self-Report Baseline Form. Results: Our sample included 5,588 with the mean age of 26.84 +/- 7.815 years. Of those, only one case of COVID-19 was confirmed. Over 42.7% had two or more positive PTSD symptoms, 42.6% had moderate or severe mental disorder, but only 14.9% had low social support. Higher PTSD and K10 scores overall were seen in female participants and with most of war variables (P < 0.05). Relationships with the partner being negatively affected and distress from a decline in ability to work and provide food were the most prominent. Conclusions: The indirect effects of COVID-19 are far more than that of the pathogen itself. A reduced ability to earn and to provide food were the main concerns indicated in this study. Relationships deteriorated in participants with high K10 and PTSD scores who also had more symptoms and used more hypnotics in the last four weeks. Smoking patterns were not related to K10 and PTSD. Social support played a role in reducing stress, but when relationships were affected, lower support was observed. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Kakaje, Fadel, Makki, Ghareeb and Al Zohbi.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is critical to preserve the functioning of healthcare systems. We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population., METHODS: Between 22 June 22 and 15 August 2020, HCWs from institutions in northern/eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity., RESULTS: Among 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8)., DISCUSSION: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCWs. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, the pandemic infectious diseases caused by coronavirus have prompted the development of air filter membranes to against infectious agents and protect human health. This research focuses on air filter membrane with antibacterial and antiviral property for high-efficiency particulate matter (PM) removal. Herein, polyamide-6 electrospun nanofibers were anchored with silver nanoparticles through hydrogen-bond. Bumpy nanorough surface and multilevel structure contribute to improve capture capacity, and silver nanoparticles provide a strong ability to inactivate bacteria and virus. In conclusion, this membrane exhibits high PM2.5 filtration efficiency of 99.99% and low pressure drop of 31 Pa; simultaneous removal of multiple aerosol pollutants, e.g., SOx, NOx, methylbenzene, L-Nicotine; superior antibacterial performance against Escherichia coli (Gram negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive bacteria), antiviral property against Porcine Deltacoronavirus and not significant cytotoxicity. Research of air filtration material is important to remove air pollutants and to prevent infection and spread of respiratory infectious diseases. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. Hence, we performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of both infections., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were assessed. Over a two-month study period, we diagnosed 80 COVID-19, 61 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases eligible to multivariate analysis. Among these, we identified delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.39), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95%CI 2.21-6.55) and anosmia (OR 7.80, 95%CI 4.20-14.49) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.17, 95%CI 2.69-14.14), headache (OR 5.03, 95%CI 1.88-13.44) and retro-orbital pain (OR 5.55, 95%CI 2.51-12.28) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.09-0.79) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were associated with OFIs., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates. At clinical presentation, nine basic clinical and epidemiological indicators may help to distinguish COVID-19 or dengue from each other and other febrile illnesses.

AB  - This analysis tested the hypothesis that current e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients seeking medical care. E-cigarette and conventional cigarette use were ascertained using a novel electronic health record tool, and COVID-19 diagnosis was ascertained by a validated institutional registry. Logistic regression models were fit to assess whether current e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. A total of 69,264 patients who were over the age of 12 years, smoked cigarettes or vaped, and were sought medical care at Mayo Clinic between September 15, 2019 and November 30, 2020 were included. The average age was 51.5 years, 62.1% were females and 86.3% were white; 11.1% were currently smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes and 5.1% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who used only e-cigarettes were not more likely to have a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.93 [0.69-1.25], P = .628), whereas those who used only cigarettes had a decreased risk (OR 0.43 [0.35-0.53], P < .001). The OR for dual users fell between these 2 values (OR 0.67 [0.49-0.92], P = .013). Although e-cigarettes have the well-documented potential for harm, they do not appear to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result suggests the hypothesis that any beneficial effects of conventional cigarette smoking on susceptibility are not mediated by nicotine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed unprecedented restrictions on people's lives and routines. To counteract the exponential spread of this virus, a lockdown was implemented in Germany in March 2020. Infected persons and their contacts were also quarantined. Compliance with quarantine measures is essential for containing the spread of the virus and avoiding incalculable consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, prolonged homestays, particularly quarantining, may lead to fear, panic, anxiety and depression. Hence, determining the psychological response in people during quarantine and their coping strategies is relevant for the counselling and support of affected persons by healthcare workers., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CoCo-Fakt-Survey (Cologne-Corona-Beratung und Unterstutzung Fur Index- und KontAKt-Personen wahrend der Quarantane-ZeiT; Cologne-Corona counselling and support for index and contacts during the quarantine period-author's translation) will examine a cohort of persons in Cologne quarantined since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during March 2020. The questionnaire will include demographic data, transmission route, health status, knowledge of and adherence to quarantine measurements, psychological impact on individuals and their family members including children, mental health status, and lifestyle (physical activity/sedentary behaviour, relaxation techniques, nutrition, smoking). All Cologne residents who needed to be quarantined due to a coronavirus infection and the individuals with whom they had contact will be surveyed., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No risks have been identified and no complications are expected. Ethics approval was obtained from the Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen Human Ethics Research Committee (351/20), and the research will be conducted in accordance with the approved protocol. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and social medicine conferences. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB  - Methamphetamine-induced lung injury is a very rare entity and is poorly understood due to the paucity of available literature. It can present with respiratory failure, often requiring immediate ventilatory support and conservative management. Secondary bacterial infection can result from smoking contaminated crystalline methamphetamine. Although there is growing evidence for the use of steroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the literature is limited regarding cases of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to meth use. We present a case of ARDS due to methamphetamine use, which dramatically resolved with ventilatory support. A low threshold to investigate drug-induced lung injury in suspicious cases can limit unnecessary utilization of resources during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK., METHOD: Data were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions., RESULTS: Relative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine., CONCLUSIONS: Current smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities., IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.

AB  - Many factors are related to vaccination intentions. However, gender differences in the determinants of intention to get the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine have not been fully investigated. This study examined gender differences in the determinants of willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine among the working-age population in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional study of Japanese citizens aged 20-65 years using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Among 27,036 participants (13,814 men and 13,222 women), the percentage who were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine was lower among women than among men (33.0% vs. 41.8%). Age and education level showed a gender gap regarding the association with willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine: men who were older or had a higher level of education were more willing to get the vaccine, whereas women aged 30-49 years and those with a higher level of education showed a relatively low willingness to get the vaccine. For both men and women, marriage, higher annual household income, underlying disease, current smoking, vaccination for influenza during the current season, and fear of COVID-19 transmission were linked to a higher likelihood of being willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings give important insight into identifying target groups in need of intervention regarding COVID-19 vaccination, especially among women. Providing education about COVID-19 and influenza vaccination in the workplace may be an effective strategy to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

AB  - Most cases of stroke associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occur during the course of a characteristic COVID-19 respiratory illness. We report three patients where the presenting feature of COVID-19 was stroke. Two patients had no respiratory symptoms throughout their clinical course. In each case, COVID-19 was confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke by brain imaging. The patients were relatively young (40, 45 and 50 years). None had a prior history of cerebrovascular events. Stroke risk factors were absent in one, limited to overweight and smoking in another but more prominent in the third patient. Two patients had large vessel occlusion and elevated D-dimer levels. Multiple infarcts were seen in two patients. Clinicians should consider the possibility of COVID-19 in patients presenting with stroke and conversely consider investigating for stroke if a patient with COVID-19, even if mildly ill, develops acute neurological symptoms.

AB  - Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic invades the world. Public health evaluates the incidence of infections and death, which should be reduced and need desperately quarantines for infected individuals. This article review refers to the roles of Ginkgo Biloba to reduce the risk of infection in the respiratory tract, the details on the epidemiology of corona COVID-19 and influenza, and it highlights how the Ginko Biloba could have been used as a novel treatment.Ginkgo Biloba can reduce the risk of infection by several mechanisms; these mechanisms involve Ginkgo Biloba contains quercetin and other constituents, which have anti-inflammatory and immune modulator effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations. Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]). The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect. To assess those recommendations should be conducted with random control trials and extensive population studies. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) exist on a spectrum. Clinical symptoms of smell and taste dysfunction are prominent features of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to elucidate the factors associated with smell and taste dysfunction amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A retrospective review of a multi-hospital health network's COVID-19 database between March and June 2020 was performed. Patients with self-reported smell or taste loss were included. Demographic information, patient comorbidities, and mortality data was obtained. There were 2892 patients included in this analysis and 117 reported smell or taste loss (4.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%-4.8%). The proportion of females with smell or taste loss was significantly higher than males (6.3% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001), whereas no differences existed between ethnicity or smoking status. When compared with age of 30-40 years, the age group of 10-20 years were most likely to present with smell or taste dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-26.12; P = 0.01). The majority of specific comorbidities were not associated with increased incidence of smell or taste dysfunction. Outpatient healthcare workers were more likely to present with smell or taste loss (OR 3.2, CI 1.8-5.47; P < 0.001). The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with smell or taste dysfunction was significantly lower than those without (0% vs. 20.3%; P < 0.001). Smell or taste loss is more prevalent in women, younger age groups, and healthier individuals. It may be associated with lower mortality and a milder disease trajectory compared to the overall cohort. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here, we present a physiologically relevant model of the human pulmonary alveoli. This alveolar lung-on-a-chip platform is composed of a three-dimensional porous hydrogel made of gelatin methacryloyl with an inverse opal structure, bonded to a compartmentalized polydimethylsiloxane chip. The inverse opal hydrogel structure features well-defined, interconnected pores with high similarity to human alveolar sacs. By populating the sacs with primary human alveolar epithelial cells, functional epithelial monolayers are readily formed. Cyclic strain is integrated into the device to allow biomimetic breathing events of the alveolar lung, which, in addition, makes it possible to investigate pathological effects such as those incurred by cigarette smoking and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pseudoviral infection. Our study demonstrates a unique method for reconstitution of the functional human pulmonary alveoli in vitro, which is anticipated to pave the way for investigating relevant physiological and pathological events in the human distal lung.

TI  - Demographic and public health characteristics explain large part of variability in COVID-19 mortality across countries
AU  - Hradsky, Ondrej

PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: The numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths per million people differ widely across countries. Often, the causal effects of interventions taken by authorities are unjustifiably concluded based on the comparison of pure mortalities in countries where interventions consisting different strategies have been taken. Moreover, the possible effects of other factors are only rarely considered., METHODS: We used data from open databases (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Bank Open Data, The BCG World Atlas) and publications to develop a model that could largely explain the differences in cumulative mortality between countries using non-interventional (mostly socio-demographic) factors., RESULTS: Statistically significant associations with the logarithmic COVID-19 mortality were found with the following: proportion of people aged 80 years and above, population density, proportion of urban population, gross domestic product, number of hospital beds per population, average temperature in March and incidence of tuberculosis. The final model could explain 67% of the variability. This finding could also be interpreted as follows: less than a third of the variability in logarithmic mortality differences could be modified by diverse non-pharmaceutical interventions ranging from case isolation to comprehensive measures, constituting case isolation, social distancing of the entire population and closure of schools and borders., CONCLUSIONS: In particular countries, the number of people who will die from COVID-19 is largely given by factors that cannot be drastically changed as an immediate reaction to the pandemic and authorities should focus on modifiable variables, e.g. the number of hospital beds.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking can cause muco-ciliary clearing dysfunction and poor pulmonary immunity, leading to more severe infection. We performed this study to explore the association between smoking and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients utilizing a quantitative meta-analysis on the basis of adjusted effect estimates., METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase. Only articles reporting adjusted effect estimates on the association between smoking and the risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients in English were included. Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was fitted to assess the risk of bias. A random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled effect with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI)., RESULTS: A total of 73 articles with 863,313 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated that smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk for death in patients with COVID-19 (pooled relative risk = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.12-1.27). Sensitivity analysis indicated that our results were stable and robust., CONCLUSION: Smoking was independently associated with an increased risk for mortality in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present an update of birth cohort study designs and their contributions to allergic risk., DATA SOURCES: The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles., STUDY SELECTIONS: Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014 and 2021 were evaluated., RESULTS: Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early-life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration affect the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, whereas high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early life may be associated with increased asthma risk, whereas viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood., CONCLUSION: Although evaluating the risk of allergic disease development is complex, clinicians can apply these insights on the multifactorial nature of atopy to better understand and potentially mitigate disease development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and supportive treatments are essential to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the current study aimed to determine different patterns of syndromic symptoms and sensitivity and specificity of each of them in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study ., METHODS: In this study, the retrospective data of 1,539 patients suspected of COVID-19 were obtained from a local registry under the supervision of the officials at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out on syndromic symptoms, and the associations of some risk factors and latent subclasses were accessed using one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test., RESULTS: The LCA indicated that there were three distinct subclasses of syndromic symptoms among the COVID-19 suspected patients. The age, former smoking status, and body mass index were associated with the categorization of individuals into different subclasses. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of class 2 (labeled as "High probability of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]+") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 67.43% and 76.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of class 3 (labeled as "Moderate probability of PCR+") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 75.92% and 50.23%, respectively., CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study showed that syndromic symptoms, such as dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and anorexia, might be helpful in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Assessing individuals' knowledge and preventive behaviors towards the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for the related public health surveillance strategies. Although some of the studies were conducted in Bangladesh, none of these studies considered the geographical distribution of knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Therefore, the present nationwide cross-sectional study with 10,067 samples for the first-time aims to assess the knowledge gap by presenting the geographical distribution of the COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors across all administrative districts of Bangladesh. The measures included socio-demographics and questions about knowledge and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19. One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. In addition, GIS-based mapping identified district-wise distribution of the outcomes. Results indicated that the overall mean score of knowledge related to COVID-19 was 14.363 +/- 3.073, whereas 16.95 +/- 2.89 was for preventive behaviors. Participants ' being male, being divorced or widowed, consuming alcohol, smoking cigarettes, living in villages, and having no formal education reported lower performing preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Those participants with higher knowledge scores reported higher preventive COVID-19 behaviors (beta = 0.053, p<0.001). However, the model predicted only 13.2% of the variation in preventive COVID-19 behaviors while the overall model being significant. The findings suggest that the Bangladeshi government should initiate appropriate far-reaching program of health education focusing on knowledge and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19 at a community level. After all, the strategies to combat COVID-19 will require individuals' involvement to control and prevent the disease outbreak, for which education is essential.

AB  - The objective of this study was to use available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors in subpopulations and epidemic dynamics at the population level to estimate probabilities of severe illness and the case and infection fatality rates (CFR and IFR) stratified across subgroups representing all combinations of the risk factors age, comorbidities, obesity, and smoking status. We focus on the first year of the epidemic in Los Angeles County (LAC) (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021), spanning three epidemic waves. A relative risk modeling approach was developed to estimate conditional effects from available marginal data. A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population. The fine-grained subpopulation-stratified estimates of COVID-19 outcomes produced in this study are useful in understanding disparities in the effect of the epidemic on different groups in LAC, and can inform analyses of targeted subpopulation-level policy interventions.

AB  - Asymptomatic individuals, called "silent spreaders" spread SARS-CoV-2 efficiently and have complicated control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As seen in previous influenza pandemics, socioeconomic and life-trajectory factors are important in disease progression and outcome. The demographics of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers are unknown. We used the CON-VINCE cohort of healthy, asymptomatic, and oligosymptomatic individuals that is statistically representative of the overall population of Luxembourg for age, gender, and residency to characterise this population. Gender (male), not smoking, and exposure to early-life or adult traumatic experiences increased the risk of IgA seropositivity, and the risk associated with early-life exposure was a dose-dependent metric, while some other known comorbidities of active COVID-19 do not impact it. As prior exposure to adversity is associated with negative psychobiological reactions to external stressors, we recorded psychological wellbeing during the study period. Exposure to traumatic events or concurrent autoimmune or rheumatic disease were associated with a worse evolution of anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout the lockdown period. The unique demographic profile of the "silent spreaders" highlights the role that the early-life period plays in determining our lifelong health trajectory and provides evidence that the developmental origins of health and disease is applicable to infectious diseases.

AB  - The National Diabetes Audit (NDA) collates and analyses data on the quality and variation in clinical care and outcomes for people with diabetes. It also provides opportunities to assess trends, determinants, and outcomes of diabetes to help guide clinical and public health priorities., COHORT: Between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2020, a total of 5,280,885 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in at least one NDA data collection. To this date, median follow-up was 12 and 8 years for people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes respectively. Comparisons with the 2019/20 Quality and Outcomes Framework show it included 98% of adults in England and Wales with diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Data include demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, age at diagnosis, deprivation), risk factors (HbA1c , blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, smoking status) diabetic and cardiovascular complications and deaths., SECONDARY ANALYSIS: Secondary analyses have included comparisons of HbA1c and blood pressure measurements in cohorts with similar characteristics to the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study; COVID-19 related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and incidence of type 2 diabetes following admission to intensive care units., FUTURE PLANS: Commissioned NDA reports will continue to inform service development in England and Wales. The same data, with or without linkages to other external datasets, are also a rich resource for clinically orientated research. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Authors.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), two receptors on the cell membrane of bronchial epithelial cells, are indispensable for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. ACE2 receptor is increased among aged, males, and smokers. As smoking upsurges ACE2 expression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are at a higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) once infected. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in asthma patients is identical (or less common) to that of healthy participants. ACE2 especially, tends to be low in patients with strong atopic factors and in those with poor asthma control. Therefore, it could be speculated that asthma patients are not susceptible to COVID-19. Epidemiologically, asthma patients are less likely to suffer from COVID-19, and the number of hospitalized patients due to exacerbation of asthma in Japan is also clearly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, they are not aggravating factors for COVID-19. Related academic societies in Japan and abroad still lack clear evidence regarding asthma treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recommend that regular treatment including biologics for severe patients be continued.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: Few studies have shown that smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to contract COVID-19, while others report that smokers are underrepresented among those requiring hospital treatment for this illness. This study was designed and implemented for investigating the severity and outcome of COVID-19 based on underlying smoking status., Materials and Methods: This was a case-control study that was implemented in Tehran and Ahvaz with all COVID-19 patients from February to July 2020. Patients were divided into two groups of COVID-19 positive (1044 cases) and negative (1231 controls) randomly based on entrance number., Results: The frequency of smokers in the case group is significantly lower than the control group (15.4% vs. 28%). However, the number of days of hospitalization and the use of more than 3 medications in the group of smokers were significantly higher. A comparison between groups of case and control based on smoking indicates that the death rate was significantly higher in smokers with COVID-19., Conclusions: The results of this study showed that although the number of smokers in COVID-19 patients is significantly lower, smokers run an aggresive curse and have higher mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the possible risks associated to smoking in the spread and complications of Covid-19, em-phasizing in the benefits of quitting smoking., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The narrative review methodology and the established process for Cochrane rapid reviews were used., RESULTS: The scientific evidence related to smoking and Covid-19 remains limited. However, there is an already documented trend in cross-sectional, clinical studies and meta-analyses on the increased risk of adverse outcomes with Covid-19 associated with tobacco use., CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to issue a warning that persons who smoke would have greater risks in the Covid-19 pandemic, which add to the many already known risks of tobacco use. Thus, quitting smoking becomes a relevant preventive measure to better confront SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We review the interaction between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and coccidioidomycosis, a respiratory infection caused by inhalation of Coccidioides fungal spores in dust. We examine risk for co-infection among construction and agricultural workers, incarcerated persons, Black and Latino populations, and persons living in high dust areas. We further identify common risk factors for co-infection, including older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, racial or ethnic minority status, and smoking. Because these diseases cause similar symptoms, the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis, potentially interfering with prompt administration of antifungal therapies. Finally, we examine the clinical implications of co-infection, including severe COVID-19 and reactivation of latent coccidioidomycosis. Physicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a possible diagnosis when treating patients with respiratory symptoms. Preventive measures such as wearing face masks might mitigate exposure to dust and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, thereby protecting against both infections.

PY  - 2021
AB  - At present, COVID-19 continues to spread around the world. People are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The elderly, serious chronic underlying diseases, high-risk pregnancy, severe obesity and other factors are related to the progression of COVID-19 to severe, critical illness, and even death caused by deterioration of the disease. The relationship between smoking and COVID-19 seems to be controversial. The smoking rate of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is significantly lower than that of the general population. Therefore, smoking can reduce COVID-19 infection and protect the respiratory tract. Subsequently, many scholars have carried out research on this, thinking that this is a wrong and misleading conclusion. According to WHO, smoking is significantly related to the severity of COVID-19, which is one of the important risk factors for the deterioration and poor prognosis of COVID-19. This article reviews the mechanism of smoking increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 He et al. Published by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Vulnerability to COVID-19 hospitalization has been linked to behavioral risk factors, including combustible psychoactive substance use (e.g., tobacco smoking). Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization., Methods: We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (n case=14,080, n control=343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (n case=9,373, n control=1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using independent GWASs conducted prior to the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, risk-taking, ADHD, and Townsend Deprivation Index; as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models., Results: Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG=0.423(.0965), p=1.33e-6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381 - 0.539, p=0.012 - 0.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant., Conclusions: Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates. While CUD may plausibly contribute to severe COVID-19 presentations, causal inference models yielded no evidence of putative causation. Curbing excessive cannabis use may mitigate COVID-19's impact.

TI  - Trends over time in adult cannabis use: A review of recent findings
AU  - Hasin, Deborah
AU  - Walsh, Claire
PY  - 2021
AB  - In the United States, policies regarding the medical and nonmedical use of cannabis are changing rapidly. In 2021, a total of 34 US states have legalized cannabis for adult medical use, and 15 of these states have legalized adult non-medical use. These changing policies have raised questions about increasing prevalences of cannabis use, changing perceptions regarding frequent use, and potentially related outcomes such as comorbid psychiatric illness or driving under the influence of cannabis. Research regarding the correlates of any and frequent cannabis use is also developing quickly. This article reviews recent empirical studies concerning (1) adult trends in cannabis use, (2) state cannabis laws and related outcomes, and (3) emerging evidence regarding how the global coronavirus 19 pandemic may impact cannabis use patterns. We summarize recent findings and conclude with suggestions to address unanticipated effects of rapidly changing cannabis laws and policies. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AIMS: To consolidate evidence to determine (i) the association between cardiovascular risk factors and health outcomes with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); and (ii) the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular health., METHODS AND RESULTS: An umbrella review of systematic reviews was conducted. Fourteen medical databases and pre-print servers were searched from 1 January 2020 to 5 November 2020. The review focused on reviews rated as moderate or high-quality using the AMSTAR 2 tool. Eighty-four reviews were identified; 31 reviews were assessed as moderate quality and one was high-quality. The following risk factors were associated with higher mortality and severe COVID-19: renal disease [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) for mortality 3.07 (2.43-3.88)], diabetes mellitus [OR 2.09 (1.80-2.42)], hypertension [OR 2.50 (2.02-3.11)], smoking history [risk ratio (RR) 1.26 (1.20-1.32)], cerebrovascular disease [RR 2.75 (1.54-4.89)], and cardiovascular disease [OR 2.65 (1.86-3.78)]. Liver disease was associated with higher odds of mortality [OR 2.81 (1.31-6.01)], but not severe COVID-19. Current smoking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 [RR 1.80 (1.14-2.85)], but not mortality. Obesity associated with higher odds of mortality [OR 2.18 (1.10-4.34)], but there was an absence of evidence for severe COVID-19. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the following incident cardiovascular complications were identified: acute heart failure (2%), myocardial infarction (4%), deep vein thrombosis (7%), myocardial injury (10%), angina (10%), arrhythmias (18%), pulmonary embolism (19%), and venous thromboembolism (25%)., CONCLUSION: Many of the risk factors identified as associated with adverse outcomes with COVID-19 are potentially modifiable. Primary and secondary prevention strategies that target cardiovascular risk factors may improve outcomes for people following COVID-19.

AB  - Background: In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Indonesia implemented large-scale social restrictions (pembatasan sosial berskala besar/PSBB) to combat the spread of COVID-19, which might influence addictive behaviors. The current study aimed to explore the fluctuation of substance use during the pandemic and association of physical distancing and related factors toward consumption of alcohol and cigarettes. Method: An online survey was conducted from April 28 to June 1, 2020. Data regarding sociodemographic information, physical distancing profile, alcohol and cigarette usages, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS), Symptom Checklist-90, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were collected. A total of 4,584 respondents from all 34 provinces in Indonesia completed the survey. Data were summarized descriptively and analyzed using chi-square, ANOVA, and multinomial regression on SPSS 23.0 for Windows. Results: This study found that during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia alcohol consumption was 9.50% and daily cigarette smoking was 20.3%. Around 44.5% and 47.6% of respondents reported stable alcohol consumption and cigarette consumption, respectively. The mean AUDIT score was 3.52 +/- 4.66 and the mean CDS score was 24.73 +/- 8.86. Physical distancing was not correlated to any substance use changes. Increased alcohol consumption was negatively correlated with being unmarried and positively correlated with a higher PSQI score. Decreased alcohol use positively correlated with living in PSBB-implementing provinces and higher AUDIT scores when compared to stable alcohol drinking. Increased cigarette smoking was positively correlated with being male, unmarried, and higher CDS scores. Reduced cigarette smoking was negatively correlated with living in provinces implementing PSBB, higher CDS scores, and phobic anxiety, hostility, and psychoticism subscales of SCL-90. Discussion and Conclusion: The prevalence of alcohol and cigarette consumption changes showed a similar trend with other available studies in other countries. This study established that substance use was mainly sustained with a smaller proportion of respondents amplifying their substance usages. The changes were correlated with PSBB policy but not the practice of physical distancing. Psychiatry and addiction services in Indonesia should be strengthened to cope with the increased burden of psychological distress. Future studies should conduct more comparisons to determine whether the overall rising intensity of consumption was maintained post-pandemic and delineate acute psychopathologies' effects on substance use.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the association of gender with psychological status and clinical outcomes among patients with 2019-nCoV infection to provide new directions for the prevention and control of the pandemic. Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection at Wuhan Union Hospital, between February 8 and March 31, 2020, were included in the study analysis. General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records. Participants ' responses to self-report measures of psychological status were also collected. Results: Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.

AB  - This issue of the Biomedical Journal tells us about the risks of electronic cigarette smoking, variations of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, and how COVID-19 affects the gastrointestinal system. Moreover, we learn that cancer immunotherapy seems to work well in elderly patients, how thyroid hormones regulate noncoding RNAs in a liver tumour context, and that G6PD is a double-edged sword of redox signalling. We also discover that Perilla leaf extract could inhibit SARS-CoV-2, that artificial neural networks can diagnose COVID-19 patients and predict vaccine epitopes on the Epstein-Barr Virus, and that men and women have differential inflammatory responses to physical effort. Finally, the surgical strategies for drug-resistant epilepsy, computer-supervised double-jaw surgery, dental pulp stem cell motility, and the restitution of the brain blood supply after atherosclerotic stroke are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients comprise an immunocompromised and vulnerable cohort. Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remain understudied., METHODS: We used a multicenter federated research network to compare clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SOT to a propensity--matched cohort of patients without SOT., RESULTS: We identified 2307 SOT recipients and 231 047 nontransplant patients with COVID-19. Transplant patients were more likely to be male individuals, older, have a body mass index >30 kg/m2, and have comorbid hypertension, diabetes, nicotine dependence, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease compared with the nontransplant group (P < 0.05). One-to-one matching was performed for diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, race, nicotine dependence, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and gender. There was no difference in the composite outcome of intubation or mechanical ventilation at 30 days (risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.26) or 60 days (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.24) between the 2 groups. Hospitalization rate was higher in the transplant cohort (30.97% versus 25.47%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.34). There was no difference in mortality at 30 days (6.45% versus 5.29%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.88-1.68) or 60 days postdiagnosis (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.83-1.32). More patients in the SOT group developed acute renal injury compared with non-SOT cohort (24.73% versus 14.29%; RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.53-1.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SOT have high COVID-19-related mortality; however, propensity-matched analyses reveal that this increased risk is secondary to higher burden of comorbidities. SOT status independently increases risk of hospital admission and acute kidney injury. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smoking affects a person's overall health and damages nearly every organ of the body. Since smoking tobacco affects and damages the lungs, it increases the risk of respiratory infections and makes it easier for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to invade the lung tissue, causing more severe symptoms and increasing the risk of death. However, debates are still ongoing as to the effect of cigarette smoking on vulnerability to COVID-19. Some studies, where active smokers were underrepresented among patients with COVID-19, claimed that a "smoker's paradox" may exist in COVID-19 and that smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. However, other studies reported the opposite trend. The objective of this study is to review the findings of epidemiological and in vitro studies about the association between smoking and the risk of contracting COVID-19, taking into account disease severity. Several epidemiological studies have found a higher smoking prevalence among COVID-19 infected patients. Also, studies had shown that people with respiratory diseases caused by tobacco use are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Studies have shown that in vitro, the acute exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and the proliferation of airway basal stem cells and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke, with a more severe viral infection and cell death. Smoker patients with different comorbidities are at higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus and have a worse prognosis for the virus as well as for their comorbidities. Further investigations of the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and the progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients who suffer from it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The quarantine and social distancing implemented during COVID 19 pandemic may hamper the quality of life of the population., AIM: To determine the factors associated with a low quality of life during COVID 19 quarantine in Chilean adults., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SF-36 survey about quality of life was answered by 1,082 Chilean adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who were quarantined by the COVID-19 health alert. Other variables studied were sociodemographic background, nutritional status, lifestyles, level of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep hours. Risk factors associated with low quality of life were identified by logistic regression analysis for each of the 8 dimensions evaluated in the SF-36 questionnaire., RESULTS: The factors that increased the probability of having a lower general health perception were being female (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.29; p = 0.05), being physically inactive (OR = 2.76 p < 0.01), unhealthy hours of sleep (OR = 1.58, p < 0.01), smoking (OR = 1.59, p < 0.01) and eating junk food (OR = 2.26; p < 0.01). For the other dimensions of quality of life, the most frequently repeated factors were being female, junk food consumption, and being physically inactive and sedentary., CONCLUSIONS: There are factors associated with a low quality of life during the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Chilean population. Their identification could reinforce remedial actions at the government level to benefit the health of the population during this health emergency.

TI  - How does allergic rhinitis impact the severity of COVID-19?: a case-control study
AU  - Guvey, Ali
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease whose symptoms and risk factors are newly described. Some allergic diseases, including asthma, have been defined as risk factors for a poor outcome in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the role of another allergic disease-allergic rhinitis-in the severity of COVID-19., METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at Sakarya Educational and Research Hospital, Toyota Hospital and Yenikent State Hospital between March 18, 2020 and August 30, 2020. The study included a case group of 125 randomly selected patients who had been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in advance of having COVID-19 and a control group of 125 patients without allergic rhinitis who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We evaluated all participants' statuses regarding smoking, symptoms, and hospitalization, as well as the length of their hospitalization and the number of their comorbidities., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding percentage of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.27), presence of smoking (p = 0.068), hospitalization status (p = 0.79), and hospitalization length (p = 0.55). From each group, two patients needed care in an intensive care unit (ICU). One patient from the case group and two from the control group died due to COVID-19., CONCLUSION: We found that allergic rhinitis did not affect the severity of COVID-19. However, we recommend that the literature be augmented with further studies on the COVID-19 prognosis of patients who have allergic rhinitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to determine the association between the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with sociodemographic parameters and lifestyle during COVID-19 confinement in Mexico, Chile, and Spain., METHODS: A cross-sectional pilot study, with 742 observations of online surveys in 422, 190, and 130 individuals from Mexico, Chile, and Spain, respectively. Sociodemographic data, presence of comorbidities, food habits, and physical activity (PA) patterns were evaluated. The HRQoL was evaluated according to the SF-36 Health Survey. The multilinear regression analysis was developed to determine the association of variables with HRQoL and its physical and mental health dimensions., RESULTS: The female sex in the three countries reported negative association with HRQoL (Mexico: beta -4.45, p = 0.004; Chile: beta -8.48, p < 0.001; Spain: beta -6.22, p = 0.009). Similarly, bad eating habits were associated negatively with HRQoL (Mexico: beta -6.64, p < 0.001; Chile: beta -6.66, p = 0.005; Spain: beta -5.8, p = 0.032). In Mexico, PA limitations presented a negative association with HRQoL (beta -4.71, p = 0.011). In Chile, a sedentary lifestyle (h/day) was linked negatively with HRQoL (beta -0.64, p = 0.005). In Spain, the highest associations with HRQoL were the presence of comorbidity (beta -11.03, p < 0.001) and smoking (beta -6.72, p = 0.02). Moreover, the PA limitation in Mexico (beta -5.67, p = 0.023) and Chile (beta -9.26, p = 0.035) was linked negatively with mental health., CONCLUSIONS: The bad eating habits, PA limitations, female sex, comorbidity presence, and smoking were parameters linked negatively with HRQoL.

AB  - Purpose of the review: To review the current prevalence, trends, perceptions, and effects of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) on e-cigarette use among US adolescents and young adults., Recent findings: COVID-19 diagnosis was more likely among the current/ever dual cigarette and e-cigarettes users, as well as ever e-cigarette only users. Additionally, the EVALI outbreak may have influenced harm perceptions, as daily nicotine vaping declined significantly from 2019 to 2020, and more youth and young adults perceived vaping as harmful., Summary: The prevalence of e-cigarette use, specifically flavored use, remains high among adolescents and young adults, which is concerning due to the short-term and unknown long-term effects of e-cigarettes and their association with future cigarette and other substance use.

AB  - Susceptibility to severe illness from COVID-19 is anticipated to be associated with cigarette smoking as it aggravates the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory illness, including infections. This is particularly important with the advent of a new strain of coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has led to the present pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although, the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are less described and controversial, we presume a link between smoking and COVID-19. Smoking has been shown to enhance the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) key entry genes utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells and induce a 'cytokine storm', which further increases the severity of COVID-19 clinical course. Nevertheless, the impact of smoking on ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 receptors expression remains paradoxical. Thus, further research is necessary to unravel the association between smoking and COVID-19 and to pursue the development of potential novel therapies that are able to constrain the morbidity and mortality provoked by this infectious disease. Herein we present a brief overview of the current knowledge on the correlation between smoking and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 key entry genes, clinical manifestations, and disease progression.

AB  - Introduction: The prevalence rate and related factors of insomnia remained unknown after the COVID-19 epidemic had been under control. Therefore, we conducted this survey to investigate the prevalence rate and related factors of insomnia symptoms in the Chinese general public after the COVID-19 had been initially control., Methods: An online survey was conducted among Chinese citizens through the JD Health APP. The questionnaire was used for collecting demographic data and self-designed questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Insomnia Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Somatic Symptom Scale-8 and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for measuring psychological symptoms. To examine the associations of sociodemographic and psychological factors with insomnia symptoms, a binary logistic regression was used., Results: In total, there were 14,894 eligible participants, and 4601 (30.9%) participants were found to have insomnia symptoms. The regression model revealed that a higher risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being over the age of 40 years, having history of psychiatric disorders, smoking, having infected friends or colleagues, having depressive or somatic symptoms, experiencing psychological distress and feeling estranged from family members. Meanwhile a lower risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being female, having closer family relationships, not feeling alienated from others and being satisfied with the available information., Conclusion: In our study, 30.9% of the participants in the general public reported insomnia symptoms after the COVID-19 epidemic had been initially controlled. When providing precise interventions for insomnia, extra attention should be paid to the individuals who are male, elderly and smokers, and those with psychiatric disorder history, with infected friends or colleagues, with psychological symptoms and with poor social support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In many countries, lockdown measures were implemented to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors., METHODS: Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale., RESULTS: Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34 years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49 years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood., CONCLUSION: The national lockdown implemented in France during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tobacco and alcohol consumption in different ways according to sociodemographic group and mental health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, and smoking adversely impacts the respiratory and immune systems; this confluence may therefore incentivize smokers to quit. The present study, conducted in four high-income countries during the first global wave of COVID-19, examined the association between COVID-19 and: (1) thoughts about quitting smoking; (2) changes in smoking (quit attempt, reduced or increased smoking, or no change); and (3) factors related to a positive change (making a quit attempt or reducing smoking) based on an adapted framework of the Health Belief Model., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6870 adult smokers participating in the Wave 3 (2020) ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey conducted in Australia, Canada, England, and United States (US). These four countries had varying responses to the pandemic by governments and public health, ranging from advising voluntary social distancing to implementing national and subnational staged lockdowns. Considering these varying responses, and the differences in the number of confirmed cases and deaths (greatest in England and the US and lowest in Australia), smoking behaviours related to COVID-19 may have differed between countries. Other factors that may be related to changes in smoking because of COVID-19 were also explored (e.g., sociodemographics, nicotine dependence, perceptions about personal and general risks of smoking on COVID-19). Regression analyses were conducted on weighted data., RESULTS: Overall, 46.7% of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, which differed by country (p<0.001): England highest (50.9%) and Australia lowest (37.6%). Thinking about quitting smoking because of COVID-19 was more frequent among: females, ethnic minorities, those with financial stress, current vapers, less dependent smokers (non-daily and fewer cigarettes smoked/day), those with greater concern about personal susceptibility of infection, and those who believe COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. Smoking behaviour changes due to COVID-19 were: 1.1% attempted to quit, 14.2% reduced smoking, and 14.6% increased smoking (70.2% reported no change). Positive behaviour change (tried to quit/reduced smoking) was reported by 15.5% of smokers, which differed by country (p = 0.02), where Australia had significantly lower rates than the other three countries. A positive behavioural smoking change was more likely among smokers with: lower dependence, greater concern about personal susceptibility to infection, and believing that COVID-19 is more severe for smokers., CONCLUSIONS: Though nearly half of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, the vast majority did not change their smoking behaviour. Smokers were more likely to try and quit or reduce their smoking if they had greater concern about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 related to smoking. Smokers in Australia were least likely to reduce or try to quit smoking, which could be related to the significantly lower impact of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic relative to the other countries.

AB  - To determine if cigarette smoking, electronic cigarette use, and rate of consumption of these products differed before and after a pandemic lockdown order, two convenience samples of adults in Central California were recruited and surveyed before (March 2020) and after (May 2020) COVID-19 lockdown orders were implemented in California (n = 2571). Multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression models tested the association between adults recruited pre- or post-California lockdown and past month cigarette use, past month electronic cigarette use, past month cigarette consumption, and past month e-cigarette consumption among current users, controlling for demographic differences. Adults pre- and post-lockdown had equal odds of using cigarettes during the past month. Cigarette users who responded post-lockdown had higher cigarette consumption rates compared to cigarette users who responded pre-lockdown (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.23). Adults who responded post-lockdown had lower odds of using electronic cigarettes during the past month compared to participants surveyed before the order (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.78). Cigarette users may be using more cigarettes during the state mandated lockdown. Possible causes for this increase in cigarette use may include increased stress, the change in workplace smokefree protections coverage, and increased opportunities for smoking or vaping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global status of the COVID-19 pandemic is not optimistic. This is a particularly vulnerable time for patients with pre-existing headache disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache patients in China., METHODS: A survey was conducted through an online survey platform on June 6, 2020. Demographic characteristics, the PHQ-9, the ISI, a COVID-19 questionnaire and a headache profile survey were included in the online questionnaire., RESULTS: Eventually, a total of 15,000 participants from China completed the online questionnaire. Among them, 2806 participants had pre-existing headache disorders. Our analysis showed reductions in the duration of headaches (3.414 +/- 6.859 vs 4.033 +/- 7.325 h, P<0.001), number of headache days per month (1.788 +/- 2.989 vs 2.092 +/- 3.694, P<0.001), and headache intensity (4.110 +/- 1.609 vs 4.290 +/- 1.680, P<0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smoking (OR = 1.397, 95% CI 1.090 to 1.790, P = 0.008) and getting support from family members during social isolation (OR = 1.656, 95% CI 1.075 to 2.550, P = 0.022) were independent factors affecting the reduction in the duration of headaches. Education level (OR = 1.478, 95% CI 1.103 to 1.980, P = 0.009) and having a relative or acquaintance who contracted COVID-19 (OR = 0.643, 95% CI 0.458 to 0.902, P = 0.011) were the independent factors affecting the reduction in headache severity. Living in the Wuhan area, having symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 and having relatives or acquaintances who had contracted COVID-19 were associated with the worsening of headaches., CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced an overall trend towards the improvement of headaches during the COVID-19 pandemic. Family support might play an important role in the improvement of headaches.

AB  - Preliminary data suggest that cigarette smokers could have an increased mortality risk from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and that certain factors (e.g., increased age, medical comorbidities) can also increase risk of poor coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outcomes. Between April 30th, 2020 and May 28th, 2020, we evaluated self-reported changes in recent smoking patterns and motivation to quit smoking among current daily cigarette smokers (N = 103) on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We also assessed the relationship of these outcomes to age, medical comorbidity status, and fear of COVID-19. Most participants (68.9%) reported smoking less frequently than usual in the last 28 days. Among daily smokers, increased fear of COVID-19 predicted increased motivation to quit smoking and actual smoking reductions (ps < .05). Endorsement of one or more medical comorbidities, but not increased age, predicted increased motivation to quit smoking (p < .05). These data suggest the potentially greater relevance of psychological factors (e.g., fear of COVID-19) over external risk factors (e.g., medical comorbidity, increased age) on motivation to quit smoking and actual reductions in smoking patterns, and may reflect that the pandemic is a suitable time for offering smoking cessation intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy should be continued, initiated or ceased in patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. Given the widespread use of ACEi/ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs is urgently needed. This prospective meta-analysis aims to pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of ACEi/ARB therapy in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RCTs will be eligible if they compare patients with COVID-19 randomised to ACEi/ARB continuation or commencement versuss no ACEi/ARB therapy; study duration >=14 days; recruitment completed between March 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at <=30 days. Secondary outcomes will include mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care or cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (<=30 days) and all-cause mortality at longer-term follow-up (>1 month). Prespecified subgroup analyses will assess the effect of sex; age; comorbidities; smoking status; ethnicity; country of origin on all-cause mortality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov has been performed, which will be followed by a formal search of trial registers, preprint servers, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs that meet inclusion criteria. To date, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified 21 potentially eligible trials for this meta-analysis. We will request trial investigators/sponsors to contribute standardised grouped tabular outcome data., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and informed consent will be the responsibility of the individual RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures (e.g., "stay at home" orders) may impact tobacco supply and demand among consumers. This qualitative study identified multi-level drivers of shifts in inhaled tobacco product use and access patterns during the initial COVID-19 "lockdown" period in the United States., METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 44) with adults who use cigarettes and/or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transcripts were thematically analyzed using a socioecological framework., RESULTS: Nearly all participants reported changes in their product use during lockdown, though patterns varied. Increased use was most common and was predominantly driven by individual-level factors: pandemic-related anxiety, boredom, and irregular routines. Decreased use was common among social users who cited fewer interpersonal interactions and fear of sharing products. At the community level, retail access impacted cigarette and ENDS use differently. While cigarettes were universally accessible, ENDS access was more limited, driving some to purchase products online. Delayed deliveries led some ENDS users to compensate with readily-available cigarettes., CONCLUSION: To mitigate ways that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate an existing public health crisis, multi-level policy strategies, such as expanded virtual cessation services and implementation and enforcement of smoke-free home rules, can better support population health during this critical period. Policies that facilitate access to lower risk products can help minimize harm among those who cannot or do not want to quit smoking. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - PURPOSE: Infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be carried by droplets expelled during breathing. The spatial dissemination of droplets varies according to their initial velocity. After a short literature review, our goal was to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises., METHODS: A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed visualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow velocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a sustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the sustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s. Results were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using boundary conditions consistent with our experimental study., RESULTS: Regarding the production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered voices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like // or /v/ generated higher velocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high velocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal tract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a decreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as was shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were consistent with the CFD data., CONCLUSION: Initial velocity of the exhaled air is a key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal exercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation. Speech therapy should, therefore, not be associated with an increased risk of contamination when implementing standard recommendations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The physical activity level (PAL) has significantly decreased as a result of the social distancing and lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is a lack of knowledge on the correlates of PAL during the pandemic. The aim of this research was to examine the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance use and misuse (SUM) on PAL during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 661 high-school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina (aged 15-18 years, 292 females). The investigation included 2 testing waves: before the COVID-19 pandemic (baseline, January 2020) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (follow-up, April 2020). The variables included PAL as measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and SUM., RESULTS: Sports factors at baseline were positively correlated with PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Smoking tobacco negatively affected PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID-19 lockdown. The substance-specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2021;34(2):151-63.

AB  - Introduction: The role of overcrowded and multigenerational households as a risk factor for COVID-19 remains unmeasured. The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households, and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC)., Methods: We conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as proportion of estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering., Results: 39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant (beta interaction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00)., Conclusions: Over-crowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19. In the early phase of surge in COVID cases, social distancing measures that increase house-bound populations may inadvertently but temporarily increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk and COVID-19 disease in these populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered a widespread concern in global public health. Diagnoses of COVID-19 in some cases are necessary because of severe prognosis. In this study, epidemiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were studied in Taleghani Hospital, Urmia, Iran., METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was carried out on 215 patients with COVID-19 during March and April 2020. Approved COVID-19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT-PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P < .05 was considered significant., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93 +/- 17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91 +/- 3.68 days, 37.40 +/- 0.96degreeC and 5.88 +/- 4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8% and 49.3% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5%-25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50%-75% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P = .085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement and suffering from fever (P > .05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80% (95% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.014-1.528; P = .037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P = .043)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1% can improve the patients by 24%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The longevity of antibody levels against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the duration of immunity are current topics of major scientific interest. Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months., RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.

AB  - The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 of 2019 (COVID-19) causes a pandemic that has been diagnosed in more than 70 million people worldwide. Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath, and acute inflammatory lung injury (ALI). In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the "cytokine-storm syndrome." Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the "cytokine-storm syndrome." Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Therefore, we hypothesize that low molecular weight compounds that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as nicotine or GTS-21, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the dysregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to daily life. This study investigated depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand (NZ) during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated psychological and behavioural factors. It also compares the results with a similar cross-sectional study in the UK., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: NZ community cohort., PARTICIPANTS: N=681 adults (>=18 years) in NZ. The cohort was predominantly female (89%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18-87). Most (74%) identified as NZ European and almost half (46%) were keyworkers. Most were non-smokers (95%) and 20% identified themselves as having clinical risk factors which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, positive mood and engagement in health behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption)., RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms (p<0.0001). Being younger (p<0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p<0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p<0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p<0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p<0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p<0.0001) than the UK sample., CONCLUSIONS: The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health. Interventions should promote frequent exercise, and reduce loneliness and unhealthy behaviours.

AB  - Worldwide, scientists are looking for specific treatment for COVID-19. Apart from the antiviral approach, the interventions to support healthy immune responses to the virus are feasible through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle approaches. This narrative review explores the recent studies on dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle interventions that influence the microbiota-mediated immunomodulatory effects against viral infections. Cumulative studies reported that the airway microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 leverage each other and determine the pathogen-microbiota-host responses. Cigarette smoking can disrupt microbiota abundance. The composition and diversification of intestinal microbiota influence the airway microbiota and the innate and adaptive immunity, which require supports from the balance of macro- and micronutrients from the diet. Colorful vegetables supplied fermentable prebiotics and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant phytonutrients. Fermented foods and beverages support intestinal microbiota. In sensitive individuals, the avoidance of the high immunoreactive food antigens contributes to antiviral immunity. This review suggests associations between airway and intestinal microbiota, antiviral host immunity, and the influences of dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle interventions to prevent the clinical course toward severe COVID-19.

AB  - AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs)., METHODS: REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study using an online survey developed by an international multidisciplinary patient-led collaboration across seven European countries targeting unselected patients with RMDs. Healthcare access, daily activities, disease activity and function, well-being (WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), health status, anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and access to information were evaluated. Data were collected in April-July 2020 (first phase)., RESULTS: Data from the first phase included 1800 patients with 15 different RMDs (37.2% axial spondyloarthritis, 29.2% rheumatoid arthritis, 17.2% osteoarthritis and others). Mean age was 53, 80% female and 49% had undertaken university studies. During the beginning of the pandemic, 58.4% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled and 45.6% reported not having received any information relating to the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their RMDs, with the main source being patient organisations (27.6%). Regarding habits, 24.6% increased smoking, 18.2% raised their alcohol consumption, and 45.6% were unable to continue exercising. Self-reported disease activity was high (5.3+/-2.7) and 75.6% reported elevated pain. Half the patients (49.0%) reported poor well-being (WHO-5) and 46.6% that their health had changed for the worse during lockdown. According to HADS, 57.3% were at risk of anxiety and 45.9% of depression., CONCLUSION: Throughout the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RMDs have experienced disruption in access to healthcare services, poor lifestyle habits and negative effects on their overall health, well-being and mental health. Furthermore, information on COVID-19 has not reached patients appropriately. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smell and taste loss are characteristic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients., METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates., RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76)., CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the adoption of restriction measures that have had notable consequences on the health and wellbeing of individuals. This survey was carried out on a sample of 905 Albanian undergraduates to assess their knowledge about COVID-19 and their health-related behaviors and communication changes during lockdown. The students were invited to complete a pre-validated questionnaire during lessons. The results show that the majority of the surveyed students were able to answer correctly about the main epidemiological features of the disease. The level of knowledge was proven to be proportional to the students' education level (enrollment year and age). No considerable relationship emerged with respect to diet or smoking. On the other hand, a relevant portion of the sample (37.6%) declared decreased physical activity (PA). Finally, a notable increase in the intensity and frequency of communication with their peers and with their parents was declared by 34.7% and 50.8% of the sample, respectively. Lifestyle variables were found to be mutually related, as were communication outcomes. The participants showed a satisfactory awareness regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. However, the registered reduction in PA may represent a public health issue and should be addressed with adequate policies. The use of electronic media seems to have increased communication habits in this population group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) have been obliged to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). We assessed the impact of PPE use on HCWs' physical health and we examined factors related to a greater risk of adverse events due to PPE use., METHODS: We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and medRxiv from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020., RESULTS: Our review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. Among others, the following factors were related to the risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use: obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking, pre-existing headache, longer duration of shifts wearing PPE, increased consecutive days with PPE, and increased exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients., CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use is very high. Healthcare facilities should take the necessary precautions and change the working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent adverse events associated with PPE use and minimize harm to HCWs.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 confinement on the eating habits and lifestyle changes: A cross sectional study
AU  - Galali, Yaseen
PY  - 2021
AB  - Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China causing severe respiratory infections and resulting in millions admissions to hospital and over a million deaths worldwide. Authorities imposed protective measures including confinement to flatten curves of casualties resulted in sudden lifestyle and eating habit changes. The objectives of this study were to observe the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on eating behavior and lifestyle of the Kurdish population in Iraqi Kurdistan. A structured cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 14th of June when the lockdown finished with three different sections. Section one (6 questions) included socio-demographic information section two (11 questions) composed of dietary behavior information including a) Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence using 14-scaled items with a MD screener tool ranging from 0 to 14 b) and sections three (12 questions) composed of lifestyle habit changes such as physical activity, sleeping behavior, and smoking habit. The total number of included respondents was 2,137. The results showed that 12.0% (256) of participants stated that their lifestyle was improved, whereas 50.9% (1,087) declared their lifestyle deteriorated. In particular, the frequency of physical activity was decreased (McNemar value = 60.53, p <.001) and sleeping hours were significantly increased during lockdown (McNemar value = 447.93, p <.001). Regarding eating habits, it was noticed that 29.3% and 14.3% felt that appetite increased and decreased, respectively. The appetite change during lockdown was significantly associated with age (p =.0001), gender (p =.001), city (p =.007), and BMI (p =.001). Similarly, 32.4% reported weight gain. In conclusion, this study is among the earliest studies showing the effect of COVID-19 on eating behavior and lifestyle changes. COVID-19 confinement had a significant effect on lifestyle particularly reducing physical activity and changing eating habits. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends either three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) as initial chemotherapy for the treatment of good-risk germ cell tumors (GCTs). To assess the response, toxicity, and survival outcomes of EPx4, we analyzed our experience., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Response and survival outcomes, selected toxicities, and adherence to chemotherapy dose and schedule were assessed in patients with good-risk GCT who received EPx4 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 2016. The results were compared with our past results and published data., RESULTS: Between 1982 and 2016, 944 patients with GCT were treated with EPx4, 289 who were previously reported plus 655 treated between January 2000 and August 2016. A favorable response was achieved in 928 of 944 patients (98.3%). Five-year progression-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates were 93.9%, 98.6%, and 97.9%, respectively. Median follow-up was 7.3 years (range, 2.8 months to 35.5 years). Viable, nonteratomatous malignant GCT was present in 3.5% of 432 postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimens from patients with nonseminomatous GCT. Febrile neutropenia and thromboembolic events occurred in 16.0% and 8.9%, respectively, with one treatment-related death. In the more recent 655-patient cohort, full-dose EPx4 was administered to 631 (96.3%), with deviations from planned treatment driven mainly by vascular (n = 13), hematologic (n = 11), renal (n = 7), or infectious (n = 5) events., CONCLUSION: EPx4 is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with good-risk GCTs and remains a standard of care., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPx4) is a standard-of-care regimen for all patients with good-risk germ cell tumors with a favorable response rate and disease-specific survival of 98%. Full-dose administration of etoposide and cisplatin and complete resection of residual disease lead to optimal outcomes. EPx4 should be the recommended regimen in active smokers, patients with reduced or borderline kidney function, and patients aged 50 years or older, which are patient groups at increased risk for bleomycin pulmonary toxicity. Because of a risk of acquired severe pulmonary illness, EPx4 may also be favored for patients who vape or use e-cigarettes and during ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the association between adherence to healthy lifestyles (as measured by the healthy lifestyle index [HLI]) and depressive symptoms among staff members at a large national medical institution in Tokyo, Japan, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The study sample consisted of 1228 staff members aged between 21 and 73 years who participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted in July 2020. We constructed the HLI by assigning 1 point to each healthy lifestyle factor: normal body mass index, sufficient physical activity, non-smoking status, non-to-moderate alcohol consumption, and sufficient sleep duration. The multivariate adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for depressive symptoms were 1.00 (reference), 0.71 (0.46-1.11), 0.66 (0.43-1.01), and 0.56 (0.33-0.94) for participants with HLI scores of 0 to 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (P for trend = 0.032). The present study suggests the role of healthy lifestyles in mental health among hospital staff working during the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in asthmatics., OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with admission and subsequent mortality among COVID-19-infected asthmatics., METHODS: Adults at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 27, 2020, were retrospectively identified. Comorbidities, laboratory results, and mortality rates during hospitalization were recorded., RESULTS: In total, 737 of 951 (77.5%) asthma patients with COVID-19 were seen in the emergency department (ED), and 78.8% of these ED patients (581 of 737) were admitted. Individuals with previously measured mean absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) >=150 cells/muL were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.98, P = .04), whereas concomitant heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were risk factors for admission. Hospitalized patients with asthma with peak hospital-measured AEC >=150 cells/muL (n = 104) were less likely to die compared with those whose AEC remained <150 cells/muL (n = 213) (mortality rate 9.6% vs 25.8%; OR = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.0001-0.64, P = .03). This group had also higher preadmission mean AEC (237 +/- 181 vs 163 +/- 147 cells/muL, P = .001, OR = 2012, 95% CI: 27.3-14,816). The mortality rate in patients with asthma alone (no associated CHF, CKD, COPD, diabetes, or hypertension) was similar to that of patients without asthma or any of these comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatics, pre-existing eosinophilia (AEC >=150 cells/muL) was protective from COVID-19-associated admission, and development of eosinophilia (AEC >=150 cells/muL) during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality. Preadmission AEC influenced the AEC trend during hospitalization. Having a Th2-asthma phenotype might be an important predictor for reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality that should be further explored in prospective and mechanistic studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the self-perception of breath odour and oral hygiene habits whilst the wearing of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 4647 individuals who answered a structured questionnaire containing demographic, medical and dental variables and self-perceived breath odour. Variables associated with changes in self-perceived breath odour, self-perceived halitosis and changes in oral hygiene habits were assessed through multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS: Changes in self-perceived breath odour were reported by 1,572 individuals and were associated with smoking, systemic conditions, dry mouth, tongue coating, the period of face mask use and its interaction with prior thinking of having bad breath. Likewise, 645 individuals started to consider having bad breath. This was associated with the interaction between prior family/friends saying they have bad breath and period of face mask use. Changes in oral hygiene habits were strongly associated with changes in self-perception of breath odour and starting to consider having bad breath., CONCLUSION: Changes in one's self-perception of breath odour was associated with the wearing of face masks and was significant for changes in oral hygiene habits. Findings may be important to guide comprehensive preventive and therapeutic strategies in relation to oral health care. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and importance: In non-intubated COVID-19 patients, subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) remain rarely, with incidence rates of 3.0 and 1.2 per 100,000, respectively; nevertheless, the occurrence of these conditions in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Up to date only few cases have been reported. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum in non-intubated COVID-19 patients remains unclear., Case presentation: Here we present a 63-year-old male with subcutaneous emphysema, and spontaneous pneumomediastinum with a 1-day history of chest pain and productive cough, without chills and dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, Chest CT, and laboratory findings. The patient successfully treated by given double (mask and nasal) oxygen therapy, antibacterial (moxifloxacin tablet 400 mg) every 24 h for 7 days, followed by antiviral (lopinavir tablet 400 mg) twice daily for 6 days and corticosteroid treatments as well as steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40 mg) daily for 8 days. Subcutaneous emphysema treated by supraclavicular slit-like incision (3 cm) bilaterally and milking of skin from face, neck, shoulders and chest done for three days for subcutaneous emphysema but regarding the pneumomediastinum we did only follow up of the patient., Clinical discussion: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare clinical finding in non-intubation of COVID-19 patients but frequently common in patients with coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome (COV-ARDS), or intubated COVID-19. In the present paper, subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum occurred at the same time, with no past history of pulmonary diseases, and smoking of the patient. The only reason of this patient was high-pressure repetitive cough., Conclusion: The authors declared that COVID-19 infection leading to subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum in non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our case revealed that oxygen therapy, bed rest, analgesic, and supraclavicular slit-like incision best option for treat subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with that in a matched cohort with similar cardiovascular risk factors and the effects of DVT and PE on the hospital course., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH., RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8 +/- 17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, -3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, -3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH., CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19-positive patients without DVT/PE. Advancements in DVT/PE prevention are needed for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Insights From the SmokeFree.gov Initiative Regarding the Use of Smoking Cessation Digital Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Trends Analysis Study
AU  - El-Toukhy, Sherine
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a plausible risk factor for COVID-19 progression and complications. Smoking cessation digital platforms transcend pandemic-driven social distancing and lockdown measures in terms of assisting smokers in their quit attempts., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine trends in the number of visitors, followers, and subscribers on smoking cessation digital platforms from January to April 2020 and to compare these traffic data to those observed during the same 4-month period in 2019. The examination of prepandemic and postpandemic trends in smoking cessation digital platform traffic can reveal whether interest in smoking cessation among smokers is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We obtained cross-sectional data from daily visitors on the SmokeFree website; the followers of six SmokeFree social media accounts; and subscribers to the SmokeFree SMS text messaging and mobile app interventions of the National Cancer Institute's SmokeFree.gov initiative platforms, which are publicly available to US smokers. Average daily percentage changes (ADPCs) were used to measure trends for the entire 2020 and 2019 study periods, whereas daily percentage changes (DPCs) were used to measure trends for each time segment of change within each 4-month period. Data analysis was conducted in May and June 2020., RESULTS: The number of new daily visitors on the SmokeFree website (between days 39 and 44: DPC=18.79%; 95% CI 5.16% to 34.19%) and subscribers to the adult-focused interventions QuitGuide (between days 11 and 62: DPC=1.11%; 95% CI 0.80% to 1.43%) and SmokeFreeTXT (between days 11 and 89: DPC=0.23%; 95% CI 0.004% to 0.47%) increased, but this was followed by declines in traffic. No comparable peaks were observed in 2019. The number of new daily subscribers to quitSTART (ie, the teen-focused intervention) trended downward in 2020 (ADPC=-1.02%; 95% CI -1.88% to -0.15%), whereas the overall trend in the number of subscribers in 2019 was insignificant (P=.07). The number of SmokeFree social media account followers steadily increased by <0.1% over the 4-month study periods in 2019 and 2020., CONCLUSIONS: Peaks in traffic on the SmokeFree website and adult-focused intervention platforms in 2020 could be attributed to an increased interest in smoking cessation among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coordinated campaigns, especially those for adolescents, should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise awareness of digital smoking cessation platforms to capitalize on smokers' heightened interest during the pandemic.

AB  - AIMS: The main aim of the study was to describe self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 and examine if long-term symptoms are associated with lifestyle factors or common chronic diseases among Swedish young adults. A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23-26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016-2019., RESULTS: The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (n=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Rhinitis, migraine and lower self-rated health before the pandemic was more common among participants with long-term symptoms. In addition, there was a tendency for higher prevalences of asthma, chronic bronchitis and depression in this group. The prevalence of smoking decreased from 18.9% before the pandemic to 14.7% during the pandemic, while snuff use increased from 12.7% to 22.4% (P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of Swedish young adults have had symptoms of suspected COVID-19 from February up to August 2020. Among these, one out of 10 have had long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Long-term symptoms of suspected COVID-19 were associated with several common chronic conditions. Smoking may have decreased during the pandemic, while snuff use may have increased.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature on the relationship between pre-existing mental health conditions and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. The aim was to examine the association between pre-existing mental health diagnosis and COVID-19 outcomes (positive screen, hospitalization, mortality)., METHODS: Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes., RESULTS: Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95%CI 0.57-0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models. Adults with bipolar disorder had significantly higher odds of hospitalization in fully adjusted models (OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.06-8.86), and odds of hospitalization were significantly higher among those with externalizing disorders after adjusting for demographics (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23-2.38). Mortality was significantly higher in the fully adjusted model for patients with bipolar disorder (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.07-6.67)., CONCLUSIONS: Adults with mental health disorders, while less likely to test positive for COVID-19, were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in the hospital. Study results suggest the importance of developing interventions that incorporate elements designed to address smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity counseling and other needs specific to this population to improve COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use disorder is a leading threat to the health of persons with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral treatment and identifying optimal treatment approaches to promote abstinence is critical. We describe the rationale, aims, and design for a new study, "A SMART Approach to Treating Tobacco Use Disorder in Persons with HIV (SMARTTT)," a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial., METHODS: In HIV clinics within three health systems in the northeastern United States, PWH with tobacco use disorder are randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with or without contingency management (NRT vs. NRT+CM). Participants with response (defined as exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO)-confirmed smoking abstinence at week 12), continue the same treatment for another 12weeks. Participants with non-response, are re-randomized to either switch medications from NRT to varenicline or intensify treatment to a higher CM reward schedule. Interventions are delivered by clinical pharmacists embedded in HIV clinics. The primary outcome is eCO-confirmed smoking abstinence; secondary outcomes include CD4 cell count, HIV viral load suppression, and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 2.0 score (a validated measure of morbidity and mortality based on laboratory data). Consistent with a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design and grounded in implementation science frameworks, we will conduct an implementation-focused process evaluation in parallel. Study protocol adaptations related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been made., CONCLUSIONS: SMARTTT is expected to generate novel findings regarding the impact, cost, and implementation of an adaptive clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention involving medications and CM to promote smoking abstinence among PWH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The US COVID-19 epidemic impacted counties differently across space and time, though large-scale transmission dynamics are unclear. The study's objective was to group counties with similar trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths and identify county-level correlates of the distinct trajectory groups., METHODS: Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from 3141 US counties from January through June 2020. Clusters of epidemic curve trajectories of COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 people were identified with Proc Traj. We utilized polytomous logistic regression to estimate Odds Ratios for trajectory group membership in relation to county-level demographics, socioeconomic factors, school enrollment, employment and lifestyle data., RESULTS: Six COVID-19 case trajectory groups and five death trajectory groups were identified. Younger counties, counties with a greater proportion of females, Black and Hispanic populations, and greater employment in private sectors had higher odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Percentage of counties enrolled in grades 1-8 was associated with earlier-start case trajectories. Counties with more educated adult populations had lower odds of being in worse case trajectories but were generally not associated with worse death trajectories. Counties with higher poverty rates, higher uninsured, and more living in non-family households had lower odds of being in worse case and death trajectories. Counties with higher smoking rates had higher odds of being in worse death trajectory counties., DISCUSSION: In the absence of clear guidelines and personal protection, smoking, racial and ethnic groups, younger populations, social, and economic factors were correlated with worse COVID-19 epidemics that may reflect population transmission dynamics during January-June 2020. After vaccination of high-risk individuals, communities with higher proportions of youth, communities of color, smokers, and workers in healthcare, service and goods industries can reduce viral spread by targeting vaccination programs to these populations and increasing access and education on non-pharmaceutical interventions.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in deleterious mental health. This dual-center retrospective cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of depression in young adults during this pandemic and explored its association with various physical fitness measures., Methods: This study enrolled 12,889 (80% female) young adults (mean age 20 +/- 1) who performed a National Student Physical Fitness battery from December 1st, 2019, to January 20th, 2020, and completed a questionnaire including Beck's Depression Inventory in May 2020. Independent associations between prior physical fitness and depression during the pandemic were assessed using multivariable linear and binary logistic regressions accordingly, covariates including age, dwelling location, economic level, smoking, alcohol, living status, weight change, and exercise volume during the pandemic. Sex- and baseline stress-stratified analyses were performed., Results: Of the study population 13.9% of men and 15.0% of women sampled qualified for a diagnosis of depression. After multivariable adjustment, anaerobic (mean change 95% CI -3.3 [-4.8 to 1.8]) aerobic (-1.5 [-2.64 to -0.5]), explosive (-1.64 [-2.7 to -0.6]) and muscular (-1.7 [-3.0 to -0.5]) fitness were independently and inversely associated with depression for the overall population. These remained consistent after sex- and baseline stress-stratification. In binary logistic regression, the combined participants with moderate, high or excellent fitness also showed a much lower risk compared to those least fit in anaerobic (odd ratio (OR) 95% CI 0.68 [0.55-0.82]), aerobic (0.80 [0.68-0.91]), explosive (0.72 [0.61-0.82]), and muscular (0.66 [0.57-0.75]) fitness., Conclusions: These findings suggest that prior physical fitness may be inversely associated with depression in young adults during a pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been highlighted as important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019)., METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95% CIs., FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (1.8%) of the 502 505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493 295 individuals. During 5 273 731 person-years of follow-up (median 10.9 years [IQR 10.1-11.6] per participant), 27 729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.87) and non-infection death (0.80, 0.75-0.86). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 7.59, 95% CI 5.92-9.73, for infection death vs 5.21, 4.97-5.48, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 3.69, 3.19-4.26, vs 2.52, 2.44-2.61), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 2.13, 1.78-2.56, vs 1.38, 1.33-1.43), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 2.21, 1.74-2.82, vs 1.55, 1.44-1.66), hypertension (1.36, 1.22-1.53, vs 1.15, 1.12-1.18), respiratory disease (2.21, 1.96-2.50, vs 1.28, 1.24-1.32), chronic kidney disease (5.04, 4.28-7.31, vs 2.50, 2.20-2.84), psychiatric disease (1.56, 1.30-1.86, vs 1.23, 1.18-1.29), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (2.45, 1.99-3.02, vs 1.41, 1.32-1.51). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 9.53, 6.97-13.03) than of non-infection death (5.26, 4.84-5.72)., INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups., FUNDING: British Heart Foundation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A high percentage of patients with cancer experience cognitive impairment after cancer treatment, resulting in a decreased health-related quality of life and difficulty returning to work. Consequently, there is a need for effective treatment options to improve cognitive functioning in these patients. In a healthy aging population, multidomain web-based lifestyle interventions have been found to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving cognitive functioning., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the web-based lifestyle intervention Mijn Fitte Brein (My Fit Brain [MFB]) on cognitive functioning in patients with cancer returning to work., METHODS: The study consists of a feasibility study (N=10), followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=220). Patients will be recruited by their occupational physicians after their return to work following cancer treatment. Mijn Fitte Brein is organized into 4-week cycles in which patients set a lifestyle goal using the Goal Attainment Scale, receive weekly tips and support, and finally evaluate whether they succeeded in achieving this goal. Lifestyle goals are based on 6 domains: physical exercise, diet, sleep, stress, alcohol use, and smoking. In the feasibility study, data on user experience (structured interview) and usability, assessed with the Post-Study System Usability Scale, will be collected and used to optimize Mijn Fitte Brein. In the RCT, patients will be randomized 1:1 between an intervention group and a control group. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is subjective cognitive functioning, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog). Secondary outcome measures are lifestyle, objective cognitive functioning, and work and psychosocial factors., RESULTS: Recruitment for the feasibility study has started in February 2020. As of July 2020, however, no patients have been enrolled (due to COVID-19 restrictions). The findings of the feasibility study will be used to optimize the Mijn Fitte Brein intervention. Enrollment for the RCT will continue when possible. The feasibility study will take 6 months (including making adjustments to the intervention), and the RCT will take 2 years. The final results are expected in 2024. The results of the feasibility study and the RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a multidomain web-based lifestyle intervention will be studied in patients with cancer. If Mijn Fitte Brein is found to be effective in decreasing cognitive complaints in these patients returning to work, it will be a promising treatment option because of being both affordable and accessible., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NL8407; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8407., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/22670.

AB  - Context: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in a global health emergency, the like of which has never been seen before. Prostate cancer (PCa) services across the globe have been on hold due to changing medical and surgical priorities. There is also epidemiological evidence that PCa patients have increased incidence and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to gender differences, age, and higher propensity for risk factors (eg, respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and smoking status)., Objective: To contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection to PCa patients and, in the face of PCa treatment delays, provide evidence-based recommendations for ongoing management of specific PCa patient groups., Evidence acquisition: A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science) as well as the media to harness emerging data on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its influence on PCa. Eligibility criteria were originality of data and relevance to PCa management. The authors note that during these unprecedented times, retrospective data are constantly being updated from multiple sources globally., Evidence synthesis: A total of 72 articles and data sources were found initially. Owing to repetition, lack of originality, or nonrelevance, six articles were rejected, leaving 23 retrospective studies, seven basic science research articles, 15 societal and journal guidelines, and 21 epidemiological data sources, from countries at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These were analyzed qualitatively to produce evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCa patients at different stages of the patient journey, with strategies to reduce the risk of viral spread., Conclusions: PCa patients may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as morbidity and mortality if infected. Once appropriately triaged, and to reduce viral spread, PCa patients can have surveillance by telemedicine, and institute lifestyle changes and social quarantining measures. If risk stratification suggests that treatment should be planned, androgen deprivation therapy can be started, or potentially surgery or radiation therapy is possible on a case-by-case basis., Patient summary: Prostate cancer patients can be followed up remotely until the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic resolves, but higher-risk cases may have treatment expedited to limit any negative impact on prostate cancer outcomes.

AB  - The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) provides an objective assessment of ventilatory limitation, related to the exercise minute ventilation (VE) coupled to carbon dioxide output (VCO2) (VE/VCO2); high values of VE/VCO2 slope define an exercise ventilatory inefficiency (EVin). In subjects recovered from hospitalised COVID-19, we explored the methodology of CPET in order to evaluate the presence of cardiopulmonary alterations. Our prospective study (RESPICOVID) has been proposed to evaluate pulmonary damage's clinical impact in post-COVID subjects. In a subgroup of subjects (RESPICOVID2) without baseline confounders, we performed the CPET. According to the VE/VCO2 slope, subjects were divided into having EVin and exercise ventilatory efficiency (EVef). Data concerning general variables, hospitalisation, lung function, and gas-analysis were also collected. The RESPICOVID2 enrolled 28 subjects, of whom 8 (29%) had EVin. As compared to subjects with EVef, subjects with EVin showed a reduction in heart rate (HR) recovery. VE/VCO2 slope was inversely correlated with HR recovery; this correlation was confirmed in a subgroup of older, non-smoking male subjects, regardless of the presence of arterial hypertension. More than one-fourth of subjects recovered from hospitalised COVID-19 have EVin. The relationship between EVin and HR recovery may represent a novel hallmark of post-COVID cardiopulmonary alterations.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Cannabis Use in Cancer Patients
AU  - Donovan, Kristine A

PY  - 2021
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medical and other cannabis use by cancer patients continues to increase. Reasons for use include management of psychosocial stressors, physical and psychological symptoms. We explored the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on on patients' cannabis use, hypothesizing that users would be increasing their use due to heightened stress and increased uncertainty., METHODS: Participants were part of an anonymous online survey of cannabis use in cancer. Items specific to COVID-19 were administered between April and June 2020., RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of respondents (n = 26) confirmed they used cannabis during COVID-19. The top 5 reasons for use were sleep, anxiety, nausea, pain, and appetite. Ninety-two percent denied they were using cannabis for new or different symptoms. Eighty-one percent were using about the same amount as before, 11.5% were using less, and 8% more. Only 12% reported that product cost affected their use and that they had changed the way in which they used cannabis. Eight percent were stockpiling product so that they did not run out during the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of those reporting a change in cannabis use were modest. Increased use may reflect efforts to relieve stress. Decreased use may reflect barriers to securing unregulated products and perceived vulnerability to the effects of infection on the respiratory system. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor its effects on cancer patients as it relates to psychosocial stressors, psychological symptoms, and cannabis use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric disorders are exposed to high risk of COVID-19 and increased mortality. In this study, we set out to assess the clinical features and outcomes of patients with current psychiatric disorders exposed to COVID-19., METHODS: This multi-center prospective study was conducted in 22 psychiatric wards dedicated to COVID-19 inpatients between 28 February and 30 May 2020. The main outcomes were the number of patients transferred to somatic care units, the number of deaths, and the number of patients developing a confusional state. The risk factors of confusional state and transfer to somatic care units were assessed by a multivariate logistic model. The risk of death was analyzed by a univariate analysis., RESULTS: In total, 350 patients were included in the study. Overall, 24 (7%) were transferred to medicine units, 7 (2%) died, and 51 (15%) patients presented a confusional state. Severe respiratory symptoms predicted the transfer to a medicine unit [odds ratio (OR) 17.1; confidence interval (CI) 4.9-59.3]. Older age, an organic mental disorder, a confusional state, and severe respiratory symptoms predicted mortality in univariate analysis. Age >55 (OR 4.9; CI 2.1-11.4), an affective disorder (OR 4.1; CI 1.6-10.9), and severe respiratory symptoms (OR 4.6; CI 2.2-9.7) predicted a higher risk, whereas smoking (OR 0.3; CI 0.1-0.9) predicted a lower risk of a confusional state., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with severe psychiatric disorders have multiple somatic comorbidities and have a risk of developing a confusional state. These data underline the need for extreme caution given the risks of COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - We assessed the duration and baseline determinants of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and the occurrence of reinfections in a prospective cohort of 173 Spanish primary health care worker patients followed initially for 9 months and subsequently up to 12.5 months after COVID-19 symptoms onset. Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain antigens up to 149-270 days was 92.49% (90.17% IgG, 76.3% IgA, 60.69% IgM). In a subset of 64 health care workers who had not yet been vaccinated by April 2021, seropositivity was 96.88% (95.31% IgG, 82.81% IgA) up to 322-379 days post symptoms onset. Four suspected reinfections were detected by passive case detection, two among seronegative individuals (5 and 7 months after the first episode), and one low antibody responder. Antibody levels significantly correlated with fever, hospitalization, anosmia/hypogeusia, allergies, smoking, and occupation. Stable sustainment of IgG responses raises hope for long-lasting COVID-19 vaccine immunity.

AB  - This study gauged patient perspectives regarding elective joint arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible patients undergoing consultation for primary hip or knee arthroplasty received a survey with questions regarding opinions towards COVID-19 and on undergoing elective procedures during the pandemic. Of the 112 respondents, 78% believed that their condition warranted surgery despite COVID-19 circumstances. There were no differences in desire for surgery based on age, smoking history or comorbidities. Patients older than 65 years were significantly more concerned with skilled nursing facility placement. This survey suggests that the majority of patients are comfortable pursuing elective joint arthroplasty despite the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High scores in Medically Necessary, Time-sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system, used for elective surgical prioritization during Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, are assumed to be associated with worse outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the MeNTS scoring system in patients undergoing elective surgery during restricted capacity of our institution with or without moderate or severe postoperative complications., STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective observational study, MeNTS scores of patients undergoing elective operations during May-June 2020 were calculated. Postoperative complication severity (classified as Group Clavien-Dindo = II) as well as Duke Activity Index, ASA physical status, presence of smoking, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated CRP, operation and anesthesia characteristics, intensive care requirement and duration, length of hospital stay, rehospitalization and mortality were noted., RESULTS: 223 patients were analysed. MeNTS score was higher in Group Clavien-Dindo >= II compared to Group Clavien-Dindo < II (50.98 +/- 8.98 vs 44.27 +/- 8.90 respectively, p<0.001). Duke activity status index (DASI) scores were lower and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, presence of smoking, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated CRP, intensive care requirement was higher in Group Clavien-Dindo >=II (p<0.01). Length of hospital stay was longer in Group Clavien-Dindo >=II (15 [2-90] versus 4 [1-30]; p<0.001). Mortality was observed in eight patients. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve of MeNTS and DASI were 0.69 and 0.71 respectively for predicting moderate/severe complications., CONCLUSION: Although significant, MeNTS score had low discriminating power in distinguishing patients with moderate/severe complications. Incorporation of a cardiovascular functional capacity measure could improve scoring system. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: Given the need for data to inform public health messaging to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, this national survey sought to assess the state of COVID-19-related knowledge, beliefs, mental health, substance use changes, and behaviors among a sample of U.S. adults., Subject and methods: In the period March 20-30, 2020, we collected data on COVID-19-related knowledge, awareness and adoption of preventive practices, depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), stress (Impact of Event Scale-6), pessimism, and tobacco and alcohol use. Differences between age groups (18-39 years, 40-59 years and >= 60 years) were tested using Pearson's chi-squared tests or ANOVAs; associations between drinking and smoking and depression, anxiety, and stress were tested using adjusted logistic regression models., Results: Approximately half of the sample (N Total = 6391) were 50-69 years old and 58% were female. COVID-19 knowledge (mean = 12.0; SD = 1.2) and protective practice awareness (mean = 9.1; SD = 0.8) were high. Among respondents, 44% had a score consistent with depression and anxiety (PHQ-4 score >= 6), and 52% reported high stress scores (>= median of 1.33). COVID-19-related anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.15) and smoking (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.64, 2.88). High stress scores were also associated with increased drinking (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.17, p < 0.001) and smoking (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.31, 2.33)., Conclusions: In spite of high knowledge levels, important gaps were identified. High prevalence of poor mental health outcomes and associated increases in drinking and smoking warrant ongoing risk communications tailoring to effectively disseminate information and expanding psychosocial services, particularly via telehealth, to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10389-021-01564-4.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the experiences of persons with serious mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, or no psychiatric disorder (N=195) were interviewed between July 2020 and January 2021. All were previously enrolled in a cohort study. The interviews focused on mental distress and suicidal thoughts, the impact of the pandemic and pandemic-related worries, tobacco and alcohol use, and access to care. Responses of persons with serious mental illness were compared with responses of those without a psychiatric disorder by using multivariate ordered logistic regression analyses. For a subset of participants, responses about suicidal ideation were compared with their responses prior to the pandemic., RESULTS: Compared with participants with no psychiatric disorder, individuals with schizophrenia were more likely to endorse that they felt overwhelmed or anxious, had difficulty concentrating, or were concerned about medical bills and having enough food; they also reported significantly increased tobacco smoking. Individuals with bipolar disorder also reported more COVID-19-related worries than did participants without a psychiatric disorder. Overall, those with a psychiatric disorder reported more frequent mental distress and more recent missed medical visits and medications than did those with no psychiatric disorder. However, participants with serious mental illness did not report a higher rate of suicidal thoughts compared with their prepandemic responses., CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic poses significant challenges to individuals with serious mental illness in terms of COVID-19-related distress. Psychiatric services should proactively address the emotional distress and worries associated with the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors and frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs., METHODS: We conducted this retrospective case-control study of 3100 HCWs between May and July 2020. HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were the cases (n=506) and those negative for SARS-CoV-2 were the controls (n=253). Univariate analysis was followed by multivariate analysis of key demographic, clinical and infection control variables., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 16.32% of HCWs. Nearly 45% of infected HCWs were asymptomatic. The proportions of sanitation workers (24% vs 8%; p<0.0001) and technicians (10% vs 4%; p=0.0002) were higher and that of doctors was lower among cases as compared with controls (23% vs 43%; p<0.0001). On univariate analysis, the type of HCW, smoking, lack of training, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use and taking no or fewer doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be significant. On multivariate analysis, the type of HCW (risk ratio [RR] 1.67 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.34 to 2.08], p<0.0001), inappropriate PPE use (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.89], p=0.01) and taking fewer doses of HCQ (RR 0.92 [95% CI 0.86 to 0.99], p=0.03) were significant., CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 16% among HCWs. Being a sanitation worker, inappropriate PPE use and lack of HCQ prophylaxis predisposed HCWs to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - As SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, spread globally, the most severely affected sub-populations were the elderly and those with multi-morbidity largely related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g., heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity. NCDs are largely preventable with healthy nutrition, regular activity, and not smoking. This perspective outlines the rationale for health professionals' including physical therapists' role in reducing COVID-19 susceptibility. Evidence is synthesized supporting the pro-inflammatory effects of the western diet, increasingly consumed globally, inactivity, and smoking; and the immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory effects of a whole food plant-based diet, regular physical activity, and not smoking. An increased background of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation associated with unhealthy lifestyle practices appears implicated in an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It is timely to re-double efforts across healthcare sectors to reduce the global prevalence of NCDs on two fronts: one, to reduce SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility; and two, to reduce the impact of subsequent waves given high blood pressure and blood sugar, common in people with multi-morbidity, can be improved within days/weeks with anti-inflammatory healthy lifestyle practices, and weight loss and atherosclerosis reduction/reversal, within months/years. With re-doubled efforts to control NCD risk factors, subsequent waves could be less severe. Health professionals including physical therapists have a primary role in actively leading this initiative.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. In this study, we evaluated the seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to find predictors of infection in terms of symptoms, health status, and professions., METHODS: Serological samples of 341 volunteers in a cohort in Marche Region, Italy, were analyzed for the presence of IgM and/or IgG immunoglobulins specific for the SARS-CoV-2. Contextually, an anamnestic questionnaire was administered. The binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of seroconversion., RESULTS: Forty-nine subjects (14.4 %) were found positive, without significant differences between gender and age groups. The predictors identified inside the variable categories "symptoms," "risk factors" (smoking habit and established pathologies), and "professions" were the loss of taste and smell (OR, 8.563), cardiovascular diseases (OR, 2.912), and policeman profession (OR, 3.875), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Although the limited number of subjects recruited in this study, our results could give important findings to be considered for planning preventive strategies in the view of the next COVID-19 waves.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: East London Pancreatic Cancer Epidemiology (EL-PaC-Epidem) Study at Barts Health National Health Service Trust, UK. Linked electronic health records were interrogated on a cohort of participants (age >=18 years), reported with HPB conditions between 1 April 2008 and 6 March 2020., PARTICIPANTS: EL-PaC-Epidem Study participants, alive on 12 February 2020, and living in East London within the previous 6 months (n=15 440). The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7% belonging to the non-White background., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 incidence and mortality., RESULTS: Some 226 (1.5%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age >70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19)., CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Recent data show an interaction between COVID-19 and nicotine and indicate the need for an assessment of transdermal nicotine use in non-smokers. Assessments have been conducted into the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and into diseases such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, ADHD or ulcerative colitis., METHODS: Analyses of nicotine administration protocols and safety were conducted after reviewing Medline and Science Direct databases performing a search using the words [transdermal nicotine] AND [non-smoker] AND selected diseases., RESULTS: Among 298 articles identified, there were 35 reviewed publications reporting on 33 studies of non-smokers receiving transdermal nicotine for >48hours. In the 16 randomized trials, 7 crossover, 1 case/control and 9 open studies patients received an initial nicotine dose of between 2.5mg and 15mg/day. In 22 studies, daily doses increased by 2 to 7 steps in 3 to 96 days until the dose was between 5mg and 105mg/day. The target nicotine dose was 19.06+/-20.89mg/day. The 987 non-smokers (534 never-smokers, 326 ex-smokers and 127 classified as "non-smokers") received or did not receive nicotine. The most common side-effects were nausea and skin itching. Forty-three (7.1%) non-smokers stopped treatment because of an adverse event of nicotine. No hospitalization related to nicotine side-effects were reported., CONCLUSION: Despite a relatively safe tolerance profile, transdermal nicotine therapy in non-smokers can only be used in clinical trials. There is a lack of formal assessment of the potential risk of developing a tobacco addiction. This review offers baseline data to set a transdermal nicotine protocol for non-smokers with a new purpose. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 from the medical history of patients, simplified models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic records were queried (02/26-07/14/2020) to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and response to viral infection. While environmental, clinical and social factors play a role in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease severity1,2, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprised of up to 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries. We reported 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases3-7. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian Randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was made possible by the community of human genetic researchers coming together to prioritize sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease.

AB  - The cholinergic system has been proposed as a potential regulator of COVID-19-induced hypercytokinemia. We investigated whole-blood expression of cholinergic system members and correlated it with COVID-19 severity. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and healthy aged-matched controls were included in this non-interventional study. A whole blood sample was drawn between 9-11 days after symptoms onset, and peripheral leukocyte phenotyping, cytokines measurement, RNA expression and plasma viral load were determined. Additionally, whole-blood expression of native alpha-7 nicotinic subunit and its negative dominant duplicate (CHRFAM7A), choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine esterase (AchE) were determined. Thirty-seven patients with COVID-19 (10 moderate, 11 severe and 16 with critical disease) and 14 controls were included. Expression of CHRFAM7A was significantly lower in critical COVID-19 patients compared to controls. COVID-19 patients not expressing CHRFAM7A had higher levels of CRP, more extended pulmonary lesions and displayed more pronounced lymphopenia. COVID-19 patients without CHRFAM7A expression also showed increased TNF pathway expression in whole blood. AchE was also expressed in 30 COVID-19 patients and in all controls. COVID-19-induced hypercytokinemia is associated with decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory dominant negative duplicate CHRFAM7A. Expression of this duplicate might be considered before targeting the cholinergic system in COVID-19 with nicotine.

AB  - Older individuals who smoke are at increased risk of having severe outcomes from COVID-19, due to their long-term smoking and underlying health conditions. In this qualitative study, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on attitudes toward smoking and motivation to quit. Participants (N = 30) were enrolled in a larger ongoing randomized controlled smoking cessation trial conducted in the lung cancer screening setting. From March to May 2020, we assessed quantitative and qualitative responses to participants' overall concern about COVID-19, changes in amount smoked, and motivation to reduce/quit smoking. Responses to the quantitative questions indicated that 64.3% of participants were extremely concerned with COVID-19, 20.7% reported reductions in amount smoked, and 37.9% reported increased motivation to quit. The qualitative responses, which were transcribed and coded using Consensual Qualitative Research guidelines, expanded upon these findings by providing the content of participants' concerns, which included perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, the added stressors caused by COVID-19, and a variable impact on the amount smoked and motivation to quit. Although half of participants expressed extreme concern regarding COVID-19, fewer indicated increased motivation or reduced smoking. Qualitative themes suggested that the initial two months of the pandemic prompted some smokers to reduce or quit, but it exacerbated smoking triggers for others. Understanding how the pandemic continues to affect this vulnerable group will aid in adapting methods to support their efforts to stop smoking and remain abstinent.

AB  - The earned income tax credit (EITC) is the largest U.S. poverty alleviation program for families with children, and state EITC policies provide a modest supplement to the federal program. Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care workers (HCWs) at the frontline have been largely exposed to infected patients, running a high risk of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Since limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care setting is crucial to avoid the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, we want to share our experience as an early hit hospital where standard infection control practices have been conscientiously applied and effective. We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection., METHODS: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression., RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable., CONCLUSIONS: Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have yielded conflicting results regarding climate and incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, and seasonality of infection rates is debated. Moreover, few studies have focused on COVD-19 deaths. We studied the association of average ambient temperature with subsequent COVID-19 mortality in the OECD countries and the individual United States (US), while accounting for other important meteorological and non-meteorological co-variates. The exposure of interest was average temperature and other weather conditions, measured at 25 days prior and 25 days after the first reported COVID-19 death was collected in the OECD countries and US states. The outcome of interest was cumulative COVID-19 mortality, assessed for each region at 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after the first reported death. Analyses were performed with negative binomial regression and adjusted for other weather conditions, particulate matter, sociodemographic factors, smoking, obesity, ICU beds, and social distancing. A 1 degreeC increase in ambient temperature was associated with 6% lower COVID-19 mortality at 30 days following the first reported death (multivariate-adjusted mortality rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.99, p = 0.016). The results were robust for COVID-19 mortality at 25, 35 and 40 days after the first death, as well as other sensitivity analyses. The results provide consistent evidence across various models of an inverse association between higher average temperatures and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for other meteorological variables and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection or death. This suggests potentially decreased viral transmission in warmer regions and during the summer season.

PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been frequently described as a complication of COVID-19 infections., OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19-related pneumothorax., METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases using keywords of "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "pneumothorax," "pneumomediastinum," and "barotrauma" from January 1st, 2020 to January 30th, 2021., RESULTS: Among the nine observational studies, the incidence of pneumothorax is low at 0.3% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, the incidence of pneumothorax increases to 12.8-23.8% in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with a high mortality rate up to 100%. COVID-19-related pneumothorax tends to be unilateral and right-sided. Age, pre-existing lung diseases, and active smoking status are not shown to be risk factors. The time to pneumothorax diagnosis is around 9.0-19.6 days from admission and 5.4 days after IMV initiation. COVID-19-related pneumothoraces are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased likelihood of ICU admission and death, especially among the elderly., CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related pneumothorax likely signify greater disease severity. With the high variability of COVID-19-related pneumothorax incidence described, a well-designed study is required to better assess the significance of COVID-19-related pneumothorax.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stroke has been reported in observational series as a frequent complication of coronavirus disease 2019, but more information is needed regarding stroke prevalence and outcomes. We explored the prevalence and outcomes of acute stroke in an international cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required ICU admission., DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database., SETTING: A registry of coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICUs at over 370 international sites was reviewed for patients diagnosed with acute stroke during their stay., PATIENTS: Patients older than 18 years old with acute coronavirus disease 2019 infection in ICU., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,699 patients identified (median age 59 yr; male 65%), 59 (2.2%) experienced acute stroke: 0.7% ischemic, 1.0% hemorrhagic, and 0.5% unspecified type. Systemic anticoagulant use was not associated with any stroke type. The frequency of diabetes, hypertension, and smoking was higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in stroke-free and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was more common among patients with hemorrhagic (56%) and ischemic stroke (16%) than in those without stroke (10%). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had higher cumulative 90-day probabilities of hemorrhagic (relative risk = 10.5) and ischemic stroke (relative risk = 1.7) versus nonextracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Hemorrhagic stroke increased the hazard of death (hazard ratio = 2.74), but ischemic stroke did not-similar to the effects of these stroke types seen in noncoronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients., CONCLUSIONS: In an international registry of ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019, stroke was infrequent. Hemorrhagic stroke, but not ischemic stroke, was associated with increased mortality. Further, both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were associated with traditional vascular risk factors. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was strongly associated with both stroke and death. Copyright <c2><a9> by 2021 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies unveiled a relation between the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and obesity. The aims of this multicenter retrospective cohort study were to disentangle the association of BMI and associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking) in critically ill patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted in intensive care for COVID-19, in 21 centers (Europe, Israel, USA) between 02/19/2020 and 05/19/2020. Primary and secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 28-day mortality., RESULTS: A total of 1,461 patients were enrolled, median(IQR) age was 64 years (40.9-72.0); 73.2% males; BMI 28.1 kg/m2 (25.4-32.3); 1,080 patients (73.9%) required IMV; the 28-day mortality estimate was 36.1% (95%CI, 33.0-39.5). Adjusted mixed logistic regression model showed a significant linear relation between BMI and IMV: OR 1.27 (95%CI, 1.12-1.45) per 5 kg/m2 . Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant association between BMI and mortality, which was only increased in obesity class III (>=40 kg/m2 ) (HR 1.68 (95%CI 1.06-2.64)., CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, we observed a linear association between BMI and the need for IMV, independent of other metabolic risk factors, and a non-linear association between BMI and mortality risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly transmitted from person to person, causing global pandemic since December 2019. Instantly detecting COVID-19 is crucial for epidemic prevention. In this study, olfactory dysfunction is a significant symptom in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients but relatively rare in other respiratory viral infections. The Taiwan smell identification test (TWSIT) is a speedy and inexpensive option for accurately distinguishing anosmia that also quantifies the degree of anosmia. Using TWSIT in the outpatient clinic for early identifying the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 can be promising., METHODS: Nineteen patients confirmed COVID-19 in central Taiwan were collected and divided into two groups: olfactory dysfunction and non-olfactory dysfunction. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and the results of the olfactory test were compared between these two groups., FINDINGS: Thirteen (68.4%) of the 19 patients had olfactory dysfunction. The patients with olfactory dysfunction were younger than those without this symptom. The statistical difference in age distribution was significant between these two groups (IQR: 25.5-35.5 vs. IQR: 32.5-60.3; p-value: 0.012). There was no significant difference in gender, smoking history, comorbidities, travel history, respiratory tract infection symptoms, and laboratory findings between these two groups., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that young adults were prone to develop olfactory dysfunctions. In the flu season, olfactory dysfunction is considered a specific screening criterion for early detecting COVID-19 in the community. TWSIT can serve as a decent test for quantifying and qualifying olfactory dysfunction. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of risk of venous thromboembolism with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: A total of 1030 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected, with baseline data on demographics, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and VTE risk assessment models (RAMs), including Padua prediction score (PPS), International Medical Prevention Registry (IMPROVE), and Caprini., RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality increased progressively from 2% in patients at low VTE risk to 63% in those at high risk defined by PPS. Similar findings were observed in IMPROVE and Caprini scores. Progressive increases in VTE risk were also associated with higher SOFA score. High risk of VTE was independently associated with mortality regardless of adjusted gender, smoking status and some comorbidities, with hazard ratios of 29.19, 37.37 and 20.60 for PPS, IMPROVE and Caprini RAM, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The predictive accuracy of PPS (area under curve (AUC) 0.900), IMPROVE (AUC 0.917), or Caprini (AUC 0.861) RAM for risk of hospitalized mortality was unexpectedly strong., CONCLUSIONS: We established that the presence of a high risk of VTE identifies a group of COVID-19 patients at higher risk for mortality. Furthermore, there is a high accuracy of VTE RAMs to predict mortality in these patients. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing clinical evidence shows that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The older age, the severity of COVID-19 infection, the ethnicity, and the history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are the risk factor for AKI in COVID-19 patients. Of them, inflammation may be a key player in the pathogenesis of AKI in patients with COVID-19. It is highly possible that SARS-COV-2 infection may trigger the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways including angiotensin II, cytokine storm such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), TGF-beta signaling, complement activation, and lung-kidney crosstalk to cause AKI. Thus, treatments by targeting these inflammatory molecules and pathways with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (Tocilizumab), C3 inhibitor AMY-101, anti-C5 antibody, anti-TGF-beta OT-101, and the use of CRRT in critically ill patients may represent as novel and specific therapies for AKI in COVID-19 patients.

PY  - 2021
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationship between current cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dual use, exclusive use and COVID-19-related measures are still unclear. This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK)., METHODS: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20-63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns., RESULTS: Across all four cohorts, 12.6% and 4.9% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p < 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15; CI [1.15-4.05]). Compliance of social distancing behaviors were the lowest for current dual users (aOR = 0.58; CI [0.41-0.83]) and exclusive cigarette users (aOR = 0.72; CI [0.63-0.92])., CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight dual users' higher prevalence of having COVID-19 symptoms, infection and incompliance of social distancing behaviors. Self-reported infection was associated with dual product use; dual users and exclusive cigarette users were linked to poor adherence to social distancing behaviors. Smoking cessation support and further monitoring on multiple tobacco use among these populations should be reinforced as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak ofsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted inexponential rise in the number of patients getting hospitalised with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a paucity of data from South East Asian Region related to the predictors of clinical outcomes in these patients. This formed the basis of conducting our study., METHODS: This was an analytical cross-sectional study. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of 125 patients was collected on admission. The study outcome was death or discharge after recovery. For univariate analysis, unpaired t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's Exact test were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and few laboratory parameters. Logistic regression was applied for multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Elderly age, ischemic heart disease and smoking were significantly associated with mortality. Elevated levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced lymphocyte counts were the predictors of mortality. The ROCs for SOFA score curve showed a cut-off value >= 3.5 (sensitivity- 91.7% and specificity- 87.5%), for IL-6 the cut-off value was >= 37.9 (sensitivity- 96% and specificity- 78%) and for lymphocyte counts, a cut off was calculated to be less than and equal to 1.46 x 109per litre (sensitivity-75.2%and specificity- 83.3%)., CONCLUSION: Old age, smoking history, ischemic heart disease and laboratory parameters including elevated D-dimer, raised LDH and low lymphocyte counts at baseline are associated with COVID-19 mortality. A higher SOFA score at admission is a poor prognosticator in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified at the end of 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. By February 2020, this virus quickly spread, becoming a global pandemic. The spectrum of symptomatic infection severity can range from mild, severe, and critical disease. Many correlated comorbidities were established, including smoking, socioeconomic background, gender (male prevalence), hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. In an extensive literature search, post-COVID-19 necrotizing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with pneumothorax has not been recorded. We present a case about a 62-year-old male who presented with symptoms of COVID-19 with many underlying comorbidities, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was on ventilatory support during his first week in the hospital and then received supplemental oxygenation as he recovered from his COVID-19 pneumonia. Nearly a month and a half after his initial presentation, he quickly decompensated and was started on supplemental oxygen and the necessary treatments. It was then, with the aid of lab work and imaging, that we determined that he had developed necrotizing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with pneumothorax. He was adequately treated, and once he was stable, he was discharged home and was told to continue his therapy. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is debate as to whether there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), possibly due to associated factors. This study aimed to systematically review the factors associated with COVID-19 in people with PD., METHODS: A search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to November 2020 (updated until 1 April 2021). Observational studies that analyzed factors associated with COVID-19 in people with PD were selected and revised., RESULTS: The authors included six studies (four case-controlled studies and two cross-sectional studies) in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses. The authors found that the following factors were associated with COVID-19 in people with PD: obesity (OR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07-2.99, I2 : 0%), any pulmonary disease (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.17-3.15, I2 : 0%), COVID-19 contact (OR: 41.77, 95% CI: 4.77 - 365.56, I2 : 0%), vitamin D supplementation (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30-0.83, I2 : 0%), hospitalization (OR: 11.78, 95% CI: 6.27-22.12, I2 : 0%), and death (OR: 11.23, 95% CI: 3.92-32.18, I2 : 0%). The authors did not find any significant association between COVID-19 and hypertension, diabetes, cardiopathy, cancer, any cognitive problem, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal or hepatic disease, smoking, and tremor., CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses were limited by the number of events and some methodological limitations. Despite this, the authors assessed the available evidence, and the results may be useful for future health policies. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 European Academy of Neurology.

AB  - The October 2020 Global TB report reviews TB control strategies and United Nations (UN) targets set in the political declaration at the September 2018 UN General Assembly high-level meeting on TB held in New York. Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing. From first detection of COVID-19 global coordination and political will with huge financial investments have led to the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2 infection. The world now needs to similarly focus on development of new vaccines for TB utilizing new technological methods. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

AB  - Importance: Stay-at-home policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt adolescents' substance use and physical activity., Objective: To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions., Design, Setting, and Participants: Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use., Exposures: In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order., Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active >=5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors., Results: Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar chi2 = 13.54; exact P < .001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar chi2 = 26.16; exact P < .001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P = .58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar chi2 = 0.09; exact P = .82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar chi2 = 30.72; exact P < .001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support. Declining physical activity during the pandemic is a health concern.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic emerging in East Asia and spreading rapidly to the rest of the world and continuing in our country. The number of studies examining the symptoms of the otolaryngology system and organs in COVID-19 patients is limited. The purpose of this study is to show whether COVID-19 infections cause any changes in nasal physiology in adult patients by measuring the mucociliary clearance (MCC) time with the saccharin test., METHODS: One hundred one patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (group 1, n = 42 smokers and group 2, n = 59 nonsmokers) and 87 individuals without COVID-19 infection as the control group (group 3, n = 33 smokers and group 4, n = 54 nonsmokers) were included in the study. A saccharin test was used to evaluate the nasal MCC time., RESULTS: Mucociliary clearance test averages of the groups were determined as 473.571 +/- 263.684, 442.966 +/- 228.463, 468.333 +/- 267.367, 412.629 +/- 192.179 seconds, respectively. When the test durations were examined, the group with the most prolonged MCC duration was determined as the smoking COVID (+) patient group (473.571 +/- 263.684 seconds). The second group, with the most prolonged MCC duration, was determined as the smoking control group (468.333 +/- 267.367 seconds). No statistically significant difference was found in intergroup mucociliary clearance time (P = 0.760)., CONCLUSION: Although the authors found that smoking and viral infections prolong the MCC duration in our study, they did not find a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of MCC duration.

TI  - Why We Will Continue to Lose Our Battle with Cancers If We Do Not Stop Their Triggers from Environmental Pollution
AU  - Cazzolla Gatti, Roberto
PY  - 2021
AB  - Besides our current health concerns due to COVID-19, cancer is a longer-lasting and even more dramatic pandemic that affects almost a third of the human population worldwide. Most of the emphasis on its causes has been posed on genetic predisposition, chance, and wrong lifestyles (mainly, obesity and smoking). Moreover, our medical weapons against cancers have not improved too much during the last century, although research is in progress. Once diagnosed with a malignant tumour, we still rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The main problem is that we have focused on fighting a difficult battle instead of preventing it by controlling its triggers. Quite the opposite, our knowledge of the links between environmental pollution and cancer has surged from the 1980s. Carcinogens in water, air, and soil have continued to accumulate disproportionally and grow in number and dose, bringing us to today's carnage. Here, a synthesis and critical review of the state of the knowledge of the links between cancer and environmental pollution in the three environmental compartments is provided, research gaps are briefly discussed, and some future directions are indicated. New evidence suggests that it is relevant to take into account not only the dose but also the time when we are exposed to carcinogens. The review ends by stressing that more dedication should be put into studying the environmental causes of cancers to prevent and avoid curing them, that the precautionary approach towards environmental pollutants must be much more reactionary, and that there is an urgent need to leave behind the outdated petrochemical-based industry and goods production.

AB  - Prevalence studies of current smoking, among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, demonstrated an unexpectedly low prevalence among patients with COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of smoke from cigarettes on ACE-2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Normal bronchial epithelial cells (H292) were exposed to smoke by an air-liquid-interface (ALI) system and ACE-2 membrane protein expression was evaluated after 24 h from exposure. Our transcriptomics data analysis showed a significant selective reduction of membrane ACE-2 expression (about 25%) following smoking exposure. Interestingly, we observed a positive direct correlation between ACE-2 reduction and nicotine delivery. Furthermore, by stratifying GSE52237 as a function of ACE-2 gene expression levels, we highlighted 1,012 genes related to ACE-2 in smokers and 855 in non-smokers. Furthermore, we showed that 161 genes involved in the endocytosis process were highlighted using the online pathway tool KEGG. Finally, 11 genes were in common between the ACE-2 pathway in smokers and the genes regulated during endocytosis, while 12 genes with non-smokers. Interestingly, six in non-smokers and four genes in smokers were closely involved during the viral internalization process. Our data may offer a pharmaceutical role of nicotine as potential treatment option in COVID-19.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the perspectives from key leaders of community-based organizations (CBOs) and clinics serving people living with HIV on barriers and facilitators of smoking cessation among Latino smokers living with HIV. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with 10 key leaders. Using a social ecological model, qualitative theoretical analysis was used to analyze the results. Participants identified barriers at the individual (e.g., low education level, HIV, and financial stress), interpersonal (e.g., language barriers, low social support), organizational (e.g., lack of smoking cessation resources and targeted interventions), community (e.g., HIV and mental health stigma), and policy (e.g., paperwork for insurance) level. Participants identified facilitators at the individual (e.g., high participation in trials, good medication adherence), interpersonal (e.g., no smoking in social circles), organizational (e.g., bilingual staff, culturally competent care), community (e.g., providing transportation, the coronavirus disease 2019 as an opportunity for smoking cessation), and policy level (e.g., existence of funding, comprehensive insurance programs). These results provide operational strategies to address smoking disparities among Latino smokers living with HIV. Further research is needed on how to integrate these perspectives into effective smoking cessation interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Italy is one of the first countries that imposed a nationwide stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 outbreak, inevitably resulting in changes in lifestyles and addictive behaviours. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions on smoking habits using data collected within the Lost in Italy project., METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 6003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years. Study subjects were recruited from 27 April to 3 May 2020 and were asked to report changes in smoking habits before the lockdown and at the time of interview., RESULTS: During the lockdown, 5.5% of the overall sample quit or reduced smoking, but 9.0% of the sample started, relapsed smoking or increased their smoking intensity. In total, the lockdown increased cigarette consumption by 9.1%. An improvement in smoking habits was associated with younger age, occasional smoking and unemployment, whereas a worsening was mainly associated with mental distress. In particular, an increase in cigarette consumption during lockdown was more frequently reported among those with worsening quality of life (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.49 to 2.80), reduction in sleep quantity (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.71 to 3.07) and increased anxiety (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.38 to 2.43) and depressive symptoms (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.54 to 2.71)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown had a huge impact on smoking consumption of the Italian general population. The main concern is for smokers who increase their cigarette consumption due to an increased mental distress. Providing greater resources for cessation services capable of reducing mental health symptoms in smokers is urgently needed. Copyright <c2><a9> Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with pre-existing conditions and poor health status are vulnerable for adverse health sequalae during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the association of pre-existing medical conditions and self-perceived health status with the risk of mental health complications during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: In October-December, 2020, 1036 respondents completed online survey that included assessment of pre-existing conditions, self-perceived health status, depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 score >= 10), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 score >= 10) and post-traumatic stress (Impact of Events Scale Revised) symptoms, alcohol use (AUDIT), and COVID-19 fear (COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions)., RESULTS: Study participants were predominantly women (83%), younger than 61 years of age (94%). Thirty-six percent of respondents had a pre-existing condition and 5% considered their health status as bad or very bad. Pre-existing conditions and poor perceived health status were associated with increased risk for moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress symptoms, independently from respondents' age, gender, living area, smoking status, exercise, alcohol consumption and diet., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing medical conditions and poor perceived health status are associated with increased risk of poor mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objective: When lifestyle changes are needed, life events or crises such as COVID-19 may function as "teachable moments". This study aimed to explore whether the pandemic can provoke a teachable moment regarding lifestyle change in cardiovascular disease patients. Method: In this cross-sectional survey study, 830 cardiovascular disease patients reported their intentions to change lifestyle, instigated by the corona crisis, together with risk perception, affective impact, and changed self-concept, based on a "teachable moments" framework. Results: Between 8 and 28% of the sample reported increased intentions to optimize lifestyle behaviors, particularly related to general lifestyle (28%), physical activity (25%), and diet (21%). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that changed self-concept was associated with higher intentions to improve general lifestyle (B = 0.26; CI = 0.19-0.33), physical activity (B = 0.23; CI = 0.16-0.30), and smoking (B = 0.29; CI = 0.01-0.57). In addition, changed self-concept and affective impact were both significantly associated with higher intentions to improve diet (resp. B = 0.29; CI = 0.21-0.36 and B = 0.12; CI = 0.04-0.21) and to limit alcohol consumption (resp. B = 0.22; CI = 0.13-0.30 and B = 0.11; CI = 0.01-0.20). We did not find evidence for an important role of risk perception on behavior change intentions. Conclusion: The COVID-19 crisis evoked a potential teachable moment for lifestyle change in cardiovascular disease patients, driven by a change in a patient's self-concept and to a lesser extent by an affective impact of the COVID-19 crisis. These results suggest an important window of opportunity for healthcare professionals to utilize the pandemic to promote a healthy lifestyle to their patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries mandated staying at home to reduce transmission. This study examined the association between living arrangements (house occupancy numbers) and outcomes in COVID-19., METHODS: Study population was drawn from the COPE Study, a multicentre cohort study. House occupancy was defined as: living alone; living with one other person; living with multiple other people; or living in a nursing/residential home. Outcomes were time from admission to mortality and discharge (Cox regression), and Day-28 mortality (logistic regression), analyses were adjusted for key comorbidities and covariates including admission: age; sex, smoking; heart failure; admission CRP; COPD; eGFR, frailty and others., RESULTS: 1584 patients were included from 13 hospitals across UK and Italy: 676 (42.7%) were female, 907 (57.3%) were male, median age was 74 years (range: 19-101). At 28 days, 502 (31.7%) had died. Median admission CRP was 67, 82, 79.5 and 83mg/L for those living alone, with someone else, in a house of multiple occupancy and in a nursing/residential home, respectively. Compared to living alone, living with anyone was associated with increased mortality: within a couple (aHR 1.39, 95%CI 1.09-1.77, p = 0.007); living in a house of multiple occupancy (aHR=1.67, 95%CI 1.17-2.38, p = 0.005); and living in a residential home (aHR=1.36, 95%CI 1.03-1.80, p = 0.031)., CONCLUSION: For patients hospitalised with COVID-19, those living with one or more people had an increased association with mortality, they also exhibited higher CRP indicating increased disease severity suggesting they delayed seeking care.

AU  - Brown, Richard

PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: Understanding COVID-19 risk perceptions and their impact on behaviour can improve the effectiveness of public health strategies. Prior evidence suggests that, when people perceive uncontrollable risks to their health, they are less likely to engage in healthful behaviour. This article aims to understand the extent to which COVID-19 is perceived as an uncontrollable risk, and to assess whether this perceived risk is associated with health behaviour., Subject and methods: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 496 participants during the first UK lockdown. We assessed perceptions of COVID-19-related risk, self-reported adherence to infection control measures recommended by the UK Government, and general health behaviours. We predicted that increased perceived extrinsic mortality risk (the portion of mortality risk perceived to be uncontrollable) would disincentivise healthy behaviour., Results: Perceived threat to life was the most consistent predictor of reported adherence to infection control measures. Perceived extrinsic mortality risk was found to have increased due to the pandemic, and was associated with lower reported adherence to Government advice on diet, physical activity, and smoking., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health messages that highlight threat to life may be effective in increasing adherence to infection control, but may also lead to a reduction in health-promoting behaviours. We suggest that messages that highlight threat to life should be accompanied by statements of efficacy. Further, messages evoking feelings of concern for others may be effective in promoting compliance with anti-infection measures, without the potential for the unwelcome side-effect of discouraging healthy behaviour., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10389-021-01543-9.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this trial is to assess whether early antiviral therapy in outpatients with COVID-19 with either favipiravir plus lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or favipiravir alone, is associated with a decrease in viral load of SARS-CoV-2 compared with placebo., TRIAL DESIGN: FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled, interventional trial., PARTICIPANTS: This trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom, with Royal Free Hospital, London as the lead site. Participants are non-hospitalised adults with highly suspected COVID-19 within the first 5 days of symptom onset, or who have tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or who are asymptomatic but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time within the last 48 hours. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1. Any adult with the following: Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (Fever >37.8degreeC on at least one occasion AND either cough and/ or anosmia) within the first 5 days of symptom onset (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 5 days of symptom onset) OR ANY symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (may include, but are not limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, headache, coryza) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset) (date/time of enrolment must be within the first 7 days of symptom onset) OR no symptoms but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the last 48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment) 2. Male or female aged 18 years to 70 years old inclusive at screening 3. Willing and able to take daily saliva samples 4. Able to provide full informed consent and willing to comply with trial-related procedures Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1. Known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients in favipiravir and matched placebo, and in lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo (See Appendix 2) 2. Chronic liver disease at screening (known cirrhosis of any aetiology, chronic hepatitis (e.g. autoimmune, viral, steatohepatitis), cholangitis or any known elevation of liver aminotransferases with AST or ALT > 3 X ULN)* 3. Chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or beyond) at screening: eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 * 4. HIV infection, if untreated, detectable viral load or on protease inhibitor therapy 5. Any clinical condition which the investigator considers would make the participant unsuitable for the trial 6. Concomitant medications known to interact with favipiravir and matched placebo, and with lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo, and carry risk of toxicity for the participant 7. Current severe illness requiring hospitalisation 8. Pregnancy and/ or breastfeeding 9. Eligible female participants of childbearing potential and male participants with a partner of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the trial and within the time point specified following last trial treatment dose. 10. Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or vaccine trial (co-enrolment in observational studies is acceptable) 11. Participants who have received the COVID-19 vaccine *Considering the importance of early treatment of COVID-19 to impact viral load, the absence of known chronic liver/ kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the participant during pre-screening and Screening/Baseline visit.

AB  - The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping among adolescents has risen exponentially in the last decade. E-cigarette flavors has driven adolescents to use these convenient, USB-like devices, designed to create a desired social image, while being seemingly unaware of the serious health consequences of their behavior. Vaping impacts protective pulmonary barriers by attenuating the mucociliary clearance and by increasing peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis. The recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized by a plethora of unusual disease presentations. Among them, a unique presentation seen exclusively in children and adolescents was multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Seventy percent of adolescents who had MIS-C also had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and we speculate that there may exist common denominator that links MIS-C and adolescents: the use of e-cigarettes. The virus targets the angiotensin converting receptor (ACE receptor), and studies have shown nicotine-based e-cigarettes or vaping cause oxidative stress and resulting in the upregulation of ACE2, which might worsen ARDS in MIS-C. Our mini-review highlights that adolescents using e-cigarette have alterations in their pulmonary defenses against SARS-CoV-2: an upregulation of the ACE2 receptors, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Their compromised immune system makes them more uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 related MIS-C, increasing their risk for ARDS and related morbidities. Currently, studies have shown an association between MIS-C and vaping, we speculate that adolescents who vape/smoke might be especially vulnerable to serious respiratory symptoms if they develop a hyper-inflammatory state MIS-C.

AB  - PURPOSE FOR REVIEW: Since the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China in late 2019 turned into a global pandemic, numerous studies have reported associations between environmental factors, such as weather conditions and a range of air pollutants (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, etc.) and the first wave of COVID-19 cases. This review aims to offer a critical assessment of the role of environmental exposure risk factors on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 disease severity., RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we provide a critical assessment of COVID-19 risk factors, identify gaps in our knowledge (e.g., indoor air pollution), and discuss methodological challenges of association and causation and the impact lockdowns had on air quality. In addition, we will draw attention to ethnic and socioeconomic factors driving viral transmission related to COVID-19. The complex role angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays in COVID-19 and future promising avenues of research are discussed. To demonstrate causality, we stress the need for future epidemiologic studies integrating personal air pollution exposures, detailed clinical COVID-19 data, and a range of socioeconomic factors, as well as in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systems of care have been challenged to control progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether this has been associated with delayed reperfusion and worse outcomes in French patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown., AIM: To compare the rate of STEMI admissions, treatment delays, and outcomes between the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the equivalent period in 2019., METHODS: In this nationwide French survey, data from consecutive STEMI patients from 65 centres referred for urgent revascularization between 1 March and 31 May 2020, and between 1 March and 31 May 2019, were analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death or non-fatal mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction., RESULTS: A total of 6306 patients were included. During the pandemic peak, a 13.9+/-6.6% (P=0.003) decrease in STEMI admissions per week was observed. Delays between symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention were longer in 2020 versus 2019 (270 [interquartile range 150-705] vs 245 [140-646]min; P=0.013), driven by the increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact (121 [60-360] vs 150 [62-420]min; P=0.002). During 2020, a greater number of mechanical complications was observed (0.9% vs 1.7%; P=0.029) leading to a significant difference in the primary outcome (112 patients [5.6%] in 2019 vs 129 [7.6%] in 2020; P=0.018). No significant difference was observed in rates of orotracheal intubation, in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock., CONCLUSIONS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, there was a decrease in STEMI admissions, associated with longer ischaemic time, exclusively driven by an increase in patient-related delays and an increase in mechanical complications. These findings suggest the need to encourage the population to seek medical help in case of symptoms. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cannabis-using youth are a large epidemiologic subgroup whose age and smoking-related risks underscore the importance of examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this population. Within a clinical trial (n = 36 received an intervention prior to data collection reported herein), we surveyed cannabis-using emerging adults (ages 18-25) about perceived COVID-19 impacts. Participants (n = 141) reporting weekly cannabis use (M = 18.6 use days in the past 30) were enrolled and completed online surveys as part of either their baseline or 3 month assessment. COVID-19-related measures included symptoms, substance use, mood, etc. Participants were 57% female (mean age = 21, standard deviation = 2.2), with 21% Hispanic/Latinx, 70% White, 20% Black/African American, and 10% of other races. Most participants (86%) reported quarantine/self-isolation (M = 59 days). Several had COVID-19 symptoms (16%), but none reported testing COVID-19 positive. Many respondents felt their cannabis use (35%-50%, across consumption methods) and negative emotions (e.g., loneliness, stress, and depression; 69.5%, 69.5%, and 61.8%, respectively) increased. They reported decreased in-person socialization (90.8%) and job losses (23.4%). Reports of increased cannabis smoking were associated with increased negative emotions. On an open-response item, employment/finances and social isolation were frequently named negative impacts (33.3% and 29.4%, respectively). Although cannabis-using emerging adults' reports of increases in cannabis use, coupled with mental health symptoms and social isolation, are concerning, the full impact of the pandemic on their health and well-being remains unknown. Future studies examining the relationship between social isolation, mental health, and cannabis use among young people are needed. Copyright <c2><a9> Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021.

AB  - (1) Background: Dialysis patients and recipients of a kidney allograft are at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown that the development of potent neutralizing humoral immunity against SARS CoV-2 leads to an increased probability of survival. However, the question of whether immunocompromised patients develop antibodies has not yet been sufficiently investigated; (2) Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were examined in hemodialysis patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation as well as patients after kidney transplantation. Patients were interviewed about symptoms and comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history; (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 16 out of 259 patients (6%). The trend of infections here reflects the general course of infection in Germany with a peak in November/December of 2020. Remarkably, patients on the waiting list experienced only mild disease. In contrast, transplanted patients had to be hospitalized but recovered rapidly from COVID-19. Most interesting is that all immunosuppressed patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after infection; (4) Conclusions: Even with extensive hygiene concepts, an above-average number of patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of infections in Germany. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the formation of antibodies even in these immunocompromised patients, we expect vaccination to be effective in this group of patients. Thus, dialysis patients and patients after kidney transplantation should be given high priority in vaccination programs.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern, which may have affected lifestyle habits and mental health. Based on national health profile assessments, this study investigated perceived changes of lifestyle habits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associations between perceived lifestyle changes and mental health in Swedish working adults. Among 5599 individuals (50% women, 46.3 years), the majority reported no change (sitting 77%, daily physical activity 71%, exercise 69%, diet 87%, alcohol 90%, and smoking 97%) due to the pandemic. Changes were more pronounced during the first wave (April-June) compared to the second (October-December). Women, individuals <60 years, those with a university degree, white-collar workers, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits at baseline had higher odds of changing lifestyle habits compared to their counterparts. Negative changes in lifestyle habits and more time in a mentally passive state sitting at home were associated with higher odds of mental ill-health (including health anxiety regarding one's own and relatives' health, generalized anxiety and depression symptoms, and concerns regarding employment and economy). The results emphasize the need to support healthy lifestyle habits to strengthen the resilience in vulnerable groups of individuals to future viral pandemics and prevent health inequalities in society.

AB  - Background: Mortality from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship with age and pre-existing medical conditions, as does mortality from other causes. We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19., Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >=18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes., Findings: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for >=80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81])., Interpretation: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19., Funding: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

AB  - PURPOSE: Trainees are facing isolation and burnout, due to the fear of contracting and transmitting novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). There has been a reduction in clinical activities of residents. The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the psychological well-being of dental versus medical residents during the COVID-19 outbreak., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study whereby trainees of a hospital in New York City were sent a questionnaire. Participants were from the dental and medical departments. Psychological measures of depression and post traumatic stress disorder were assessed utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire. Other variables compared were age, gender, smoking status, living situation and comorbidities. Data analysis utilized chi-squared (X2) and t-tests. Bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses were also utilized., RESULTS: The survey was sent to 19 dental (Dental) and 171 medical (MD) residents. There were 66 participants. The response rate was 63.16 and 35.09% for the Dental and MD residents, respectively. The mean age for the Dental and MD residents, respectively, was 29.62 +/- 2.09 and 34.82 +/- 9.32 (P = .014). Eighty-one percent of the Dental respondents were male and 33.3% of the MD respondents were male (P < .001). The mean PHQ-9 score was 18.29 +/- 2.88 vs 7.24 +/- 7.41 for Dental and MD residents, respectively (P < .001). A higher score represents increased severity of depression. The Dental residents scored 61.9 +/- 3.90 on the IES-R vs 30.36 +/- 24.67 (P < .001). A higher score indicates a greater frequency of intrusive thoughts and avoidance. Forty-two percent of Dental and 13.3% of MD residents tested positive; 25% of Dental and 28.9% of MD residents self-reported symptoms for COVID-19. Being positive or symptomatic resulted in statistically significant higher IES-R and PHQ-9 scores., CONCLUSIONS: Dental residents and being positive or symptomatic for COVID-19 resulted in higher PHQ-9 and IES-R scores. Being aware of the impact of COVID-19 is an important step in providing intervention. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - COVID-19: a pandemic converged with global tobacco epidemic and widespread vaping - state of the evidence
AU  - Besaratinia, Ahmad
PY  - 2021
AB  - This review highlights the convergence of three global health challenges at a crossroad where the pandemic of COVID-19 meets the tobacco epidemic and vaping. It begins with an overview of the current knowledge on the biology, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of COVID-19. It then presents the state of smoking and vaping during the pandemic by summarizing the published data on prevalence, use patterns, product availability/accessibility, sales records, and motivation to quit before- and after the start of the pandemic. It highlights the state of evidence on the association of tobacco product use with COVID-19 infection and transmission rates, symptom severity, and clinical outcomes. Also discussed are proposed biological mechanisms and behavioral factors that may modulate COVID-19 risk in tobacco product users. Furthermore, competing hypotheses on the protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19 as well as the claimed "smokers' paradox" are discussed. Considerations and challenges of COVID-19 vaccination in tobacco product users are underscored. Collectively, the present data show an 'incomplete' but rapidly-shaping picture on the association of tobacco product use and COVID-19 infection, disease course, and clinical outcomes. Evidence is also growing on the mechanisms by which tobacco product use may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology. While we await definitive conclusions on the relative risk of COVID-19 infection in tobacco product users, compelling data confirm that many comorbidities associated with/caused by smoking predispose to COVID-19 infection, severe disease, and poor prognosis. Additionally, it is becoming increasing clear that should smokers get the disease, they are more likely to have serious health consequences. Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - JUUL is a groundbreaking electronic cigarette (e-cig) and the preeminent vaping product on the market. We present an overview of the rapid and spectacular rise of JUUL and its remarkable fall within the timespan of 2015 - 2020. We highlight JUUL's entering the market in June 2015, becoming the industry leader in mid 2017, and experiencing a litany of setbacks by late 2019 through to early 2020. We address the role played by JUUL in the ongoing epidemic of youth vaping. We also feature competing views on the public health impact of JUUL use (in particular), and e-cig vaping (in general). We further highlight the latest trends in youth vaping and sales records for JUUL and tobacco cigarettes. In view of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, we briefly summarize the existing evidence on the relationship between vaping and smoking and the prevalence, disease course, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of active cancer in COVID-19 patients is poorly defined; however, most studies showed a poorer outcome in cancer patients compared to the general population., METHODS: We analysed clinical data from 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Uni-multivariable analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors of COVID-19 survival; propensity score matching was used to estimate the impact of cancer., RESULTS: Of 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 46 had active cancer (8%). Comorbidities included diabetes (n = 137, 25%), hypertension (n = 284, 51%), coronary artery disease (n = 114, 20%) and dyslipidaemia (n = 122, 22%). Oncologic patients were older (mean age 71 vs 65, p = 0.012), more often smokers (20% vs 8%, p = 0.009), with higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (13.3 vs 8.2, p = 0.046). Fatality rate was 50% (CI 95%: 34.9;65.1) in cancer patients and 20.2% (CI 95%: 16.8;23.9) in the non-oncologic population. Multivariable analysis showed active cancer (HRactive: 2.26, p = 0.001), age (HRage>65years: 1.08, p < 0.001), as well as lactate dehydrogenase (HRLDH>248mU/mL: 2.42, p = 0.007), PaO2/FiO2 (HRcontinuous: 1.00, p < 0.001), procalcitonin (HRPCT>0.5ng/mL: 2.21, p < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HRyes: 1.67, p = 0.010), cigarette smoking (HRyes: 1.65, p = 0.041) to be independent statistically significant predictors of outcome. Propensity score matching showed a 1.92x risk of death in active cancer patients compared to non-oncologic patients (p = 0.013), adjusted for ICU-related bias. We observed a median OS of 14 days for cancer patients vs 35 days for other patients., CONCLUSION: A near-doubled death rate between cancer and non-cancer COVID-19 patients was reported. Active cancer has a negative impact on clinical outcome regardless of pre-existing clinical comorbidities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency. Individuals with substance use disorder have a higher risk of infection and may suffer from more severe forms of the disease. Our goal is to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity in individuals with different substance use and explore whether specific types of substance are potentially associated with more clinical risk factors which could increase morbimortality in this population. The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The individual prognostic factors for COVID-19 are unclear. For this reason, we aimed to present a state-of-the-art systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed from January 1, 2020 to July 26, 2020 to identify non-overlapping studies examining the association of any prognostic factor with any adverse outcome in patients with COVID-19. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and between-study heterogeneity was quantified using I2 metric. Presence of small-study effects was assessed by applying the Egger's regression test., RESULTS: We identified 428 eligible articles, which were used in a total of 263 meta-analyses examining the association of 91 unique prognostic factors with 11 outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, obstructive sleep apnea, pharyngalgia, history of venous thromboembolism, sex, coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, any immunosuppressive medication, peripheral arterial disease, rheumatological disease and smoking were associated with at least one outcome and had >1000 events, p-value <0.005, I2 <50%, 95% prediction interval excluding the null value, and absence of small-study effects in the respective meta-analysis. The risk of bias assessment using the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool indicated high risk of bias in 302 of 428 articles for study participation, 389 articles for adjustment for other prognostic factors, and 396 articles for statistical analysis and reporting., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could be used for prognostic model building and guide patients' selection for randomised clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been argued that asthma does not increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated., RESULTS: Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to demonstrate the consistency of our findings.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of hyposmia and dysgeusia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their temporal relationship with the onset of other symptoms., Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted during the month of March 2020 to the nonintensive COVID unit of Udine University Hospital on the basis of a positive swab test and/or of clinical-radiologic signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and results expressed as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., Results: Of 141 patients admitted, 93 were interviewed. Hyposmia and dysgeusia were present in 58 cases (62.4%). In 22.4% of them, olfactory and gustatory impairment clearly preceded systemic symptoms. The presence of active smoking was very limited in both groups: 8.6% in hyposmic vs 2.9% in normosmic patients (odds ratio 3.2; 95% CI 0.3-28.6). Moreover, total leukocytes and neutrophils count were respectively 23% (effect estimate 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.42) and 29% (effect estimate 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.54) lower in the hyposmic cohort. No difference was found for other inflammatory biomarkers., Conclusions: Hyposmia and dysgeusia are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and can precede systemic symptoms. They should be actively searched and prompt close monitoring and isolation until infection is confirmed or disproven. The lower number of total leukocytes and neutrophils in hyposmic patients might indicate an early-phase virus-induced cytopenia. Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 American Academy of Neurology.

Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is known to block acetylcholine (ACh) as well as many other neuroreceptors and neuromodulators. The recent mention of a potential protective effect of nicotine in COVID 19, by blocking ACh, attracted our attention and guided the present study. Our results show a significant difference between the number of infected individuals in the general population and the number of patients injected with BoNT/A who showed signs of COVID 19.

AB  - RATIONAL: During pandemics, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of university healthcare students' is expected to be affected negatively, impacting the students' learning process., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the level of anxiety and depression of healthcare students living in Jordan, and the effect on their learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey completed by students studying a healthcare-oriented degree in a university in Jordan. Participants were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The validated previously published Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was used as a part of the online survey to assess students' anxiety/depression scores. Students' responses regarding their learning process during the COVID-19 was also assessed., RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 21.62 (SD = 4.90), with the majority being females (67.1%). The HADs' assessment revealed that 43.8% and 40.0% of participants had normal anxiety and depression scores, while 22.4% showed borderline abnormal anxiety/depression scores (33.8%). Many students (33.8%) were classified to have abnormal anxiety scores, while a smaller proportion (26.2%) was classified to have abnormal depression scores. Smoking (p = 0.022), lower family income (p = 0.039), and use of medications (p = 0.032) were positively associated with higher (worse) anxiety scores. Ranking the learning process during COVID-19 showed that 45.8% of the participants believed it was a 'good/very good/excellent' process., CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression levels amongst university healthcare students in Jordan were found to be high when assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the learning process during the pandemic was not accepted by more than half of the students. Implementing psychological interventions for healthcare students during pandemics is strongly recommended in order to optimize students' mental health and their learning process alike.

AB  - Background: Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..

AB  - Introduction: Containment measures implemented to minimize the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported to be negatively affecting mental health, diet, and alcohol consumption. These factors, as well as poor cardiometabolic health and insufficient physical and cognitive activity, are known to increase the risk of developing dementia. COVID-19 "lockdown" measures may have exacerbated these dementia risk factors among people in mid-to-later life., Methods: We compared longitudinal data from before (October 2019) and during (April-June 2020) the first COVID-19 lockdown period in Tasmania, Australia. Participants (n = 1671) were 50+ years of age and engaged in a public health program targeting dementia risk reduction, with one-third participating in the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (PD-MOOC). Regression models were used to assess changes in smoking, alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), diet, physical exercise, cognitive and social activity, anxiety and depression, and management of cholesterol, diabetes, and blood pressure. Where significant changes were noted, the moderating influence of being in current employment, living with others, and completing the PD-MOOC was tested., Results: Although friend networks contracted marginally during lockdown, no detrimental effects on modifiable dementia risk factors were noted. Anxiety levels and alcohol consumption decreased, there was no change in depression scores, and small but significant improvements were observed in cognitive and physical activity, smoking, diet, and BMI. Stronger improvements in cognitive activity were observed among people who were cohabiting (not living alone) and both cognitive activity and adherence to the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurological Delay) improved more for people who participated in the PD-MOOC., Discussion: Longitudinal data did not show widespread negative effects of COVID-19 lockdown on modifiable dementia risk factors in this sample. The results counter the dominant narratives of universal pandemic-related distress and suggest that engaging at-risk populations in proactive health promotion and education campaigns during lockdown events could be a protective public health strategy.

AB  - This study characterizes vape shop closings, openings, and changes in product mix in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas with different tobacco and marijuana policies. With concern for higher rates of marijuana use among those who vape nicotine, the presence of marijuana-related terms in store names was also assessed. A census of stores that were classified online as vape shops/stores or vaporizer stores were telephoned in April-May 2018 (n = 739) and July-September 2019 (n = 919) to verify whether vape products and other tobacco products (OTP) were sold. We computed the percent of stores that closed, opened, and started/stopped selling OTP. Multilevel models tested whether these events varied by store type and by neighborhood demographics. Within 16 months, 11.5% of 739 stores had closed and 29.8% of 919 stores at follow-up had opened. Closings were more likely among vape-only than vape + OTP stores (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.47,4.29); vape-only stores were less likely to open (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.34,0.62). Regardless of store type, the odds of a store opening increased as the proportion of non-Hispanic/Latino White residents in the census tract increased (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.18,1.85). Overall, 2.0% of stores (vape-only and vape + OTP) had marijuana-related names at baseline and 3.5% at follow-up. The observed change (1.6% to 5.8%) was greatest in Oklahoma City, where the state legalized medical marijuana between baseline and follow-up. More stores were opening than closing in six U.S. metropolitan statistical areas before statewide sales restrictions on flavored tobacco and COVID-19. Uniform licensing is recommended to define vape shops and track their location and sales practices. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Properly conducted serological survey can help determine infection disease true spread. This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naive seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused devastating impacts globally. To mitigate virus spread, Israel imposed severe restrictions during March-April 2020. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in April 2020 among current and ex-smokers to explore changes in smoking behaviour and home-smoking rules during this period. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression examined associations between sociodemographic characteristics and perceived risk of infection and quitting smoking during the initial COVID-19 period. Current smoking was reported by 437 (66.2%) of the 660 participants, 46 (7%) quit during the initial restriction period, and 177 (26.8%) were ex-smokers. Nearly half (44.4%) of current smokers intensified their smoking, and 16% attempted to quit. Quitting during the COVID-19 period was significantly associated with higher education (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.97, 95% CI: 1.0-3.8), not living with a smoker (aOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.0-4.4), and having an underlying chronic condition that increases risk for COVID-19 complications (aOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.1-4.6). Both an increase in smoking behaviour and in attempts to quit smoking during the initial COVID-19 pandemic were evident in this sample of adult Israeli smokers. Governments need to use this opportunity to encourage smokers to attempt quitting and create smoke-free homes, especially during lockdown conditions, while providing mental and social support to all smokers.

AB  - Background: Whether COVID-19 comorbidities and risk factors such as old age, male gender, smoking, obesity, eosinophils and blood types have direct contact with expression of ACE2 and pro-inflammation cytokines in human lung tissues were still unclear., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with normal FEV1 and FEV1/FVC underwent thoracotomy for pulmonary nodules were included. Blinded histological assessments were performed by two pathologists. Clinical features and results of the immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 were collected and analyzed., Results: ACE2 expressed in alveolar macrophages (most obvious), alveolar epithelia and vascular endothelia, but not in small-airway epithelia. ACE2 expressions are positively related to age (r =0.26, P =0.040), weight (r =0.43, P<0.001), as well as BMI (r = 0.38, P =0.002), and male patients show higher expressions of ACE2 in lungs (P <0.05). ACE2 expressions are negatively related to peripheral eosinophils (r = -0.30, P =0.017). There was no correlation between ABO blood types and ACE2 expression in normal lung tissues (P > 0.05). IL-13 and IL-6R expression in lung tissue increased with age (r =0.26, P <0.05, for both)., Conclusion: Our pathological evidences showed that the alveolar epithelia, vascular endothelia, and alveolar macrophages are susceptible in human lungs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk factors such as high body weight/BMI, old age, male gender, and eosinopenia may be related to ACE2 expression in human lungs, and associated with more chance to develop the severe cases. IL-6R expression in lung tissue also increased with age. Therefore, weight control and smoking cessation are essential to reduce the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in obesity, old or male patients. Peripheral eosinophils monitor is also quite necessary to detect severe tendency in COVID-19 patients. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Bao et al.

AB  - Objective: A triple combination of interferon (IFN) alpha-2b, lopinavir tablets, and umifenovir was used to treat COVID-19 patients. It is important to explore whether the benefit of this therapy is time dependent., Methods: A cohort of moderate COVID-19 patients (n = 54) was admitted for hospitalization. The demographic (age, gender, and smoking status) and clinical characteristics (epidemiological trace and comorbidity) were collected from the digital medical records. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and the viral shedding time (VST) were set as the outcomes for COVID-19 cases., Results: After control for age, sex, epidemiological trace, smoking, and comorbidity, the time of treatment start had null effect on VST (IRR = 1.09; 95% CI = 0.91-1.30; p = 0.33) or LOS (IRR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.94-1.28; p = 0.23)., Conclusion: There is no convincing evidence to support a pivotal role of the timing of the therapy in the prognosis of moderate COVID-19 cases.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly throughout the world. Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.

TI  - Region-specific COVID-19 risk scores and nutritional status of a high-risk population based on individual vulnerability assessment in the national survey data
AU  - Baik, Inkyung
PY  - 2021
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic outbreak leading to more than 1 million deaths worldwide as reported in 2020. Several risk assessment tools, including individual vulnerability to COVID-19, have been developed. The present study aimed to characterize a high-risk population using such a tool and examine risk factors and nutritional status in the national survey data and estimate the region-specific population size., METHODS: The study included 17,540 Korean adults who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The risk scores for individual vulnerability to COVID-19 were calculated based on age, sex, smoking status, and comorbidities, and a high-risk population was defined as having risk scores >=11. Nutritional status was compared between the high-risk population and the remaining participants in the KNHANES data. The region-specific population size was estimated using national statistics., RESULTS: The proportion of the high-risk population was estimated to be 10.5%, which corresponds to approximately 4.6 million adults in South Korea. About 20% of them had inadequate intake of all of vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, and C below the estimated average requirement. The high-risk population showed 1.65 [95% confidence interval: 1.39, 1.96] higher odds of inadequate intake of multiple vitamins than the remaining participants. In the ecological analysis, the region-specific numbers of the high-risk population correlated significantly with the actual numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 (P value = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals vulnerable to COVID-19, in particular those are living in densely populated regions, should pay particular attention to the protection against this pandemic and have adequate nutritional status, which may support optimal immune function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On March 20, 2020, the Argentine Ministry of Health imposed a mandatory quarantine, which still persists., AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the variation in the prevalence of depression since the beginning of the quarantine and the evolution of risk factors, with special emphasis on the population's concerns., METHODS: A longitudinal study was carried out using a digital questionnaire disseminated in social networks. The first stage (T1) was carried out from March 29 to April 12 and the second stage (T2) from May 23 to June 12, 2020. The prevalence of depression was measured using the 9-item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)., RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate/severe depression increased from 24.3% in T1 to 47.8% in T2 (p: 0.000). Risk factors increased significantly: age 18-27, female, primary and secondary school, smoking and having a poor sleep quality (p: 0.000). The concerns about 'a family member getting sick' (OR: 1.28; CI: 1.04-1.58; p: 0.016), 'changes at work' (OR: 2.24; CI: 1.79-2.81; p: 0.000), 'running out of money' (OR: 1.43; CI: 1.20-1.71; p: 0.000) and 'being unemployed' (OR: 2.99; CI: 2.55-3.52; p: 0.000) were risk factors for depression. On the other hand, the concern about 'getting the virus' (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.61-0.87; p: 0.001) was not a risk factor., CONCLUSIONS: The extended quarantine in Argentina is associated with an increase in the prevalence of depression; the high impact of economic and social concerns on mental health must be considered in order to avoid long-term effects.

AB  - COVID-19 is considered a respiratory disease which has many symptoms associated with the larynx and the lungs infections. COVID-19 has wide spectrum of clinical features starting from mild symptoms to severe illness. Otolaryngological symptoms as nasal obstruction, loss of smell, taste dysfunction, sore throat, sticky mucus, and dysphagia are common in COVID-19 patients. Other vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia are common in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to detect the occurrence of vocal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in Egypt and to investigate the videolaryngoscopic findings associated with these symptoms. A total number of 106 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were randomly assessed for vocal symptoms. The following epidemiological and clinical data were collected: age, gender, smoking consumption, general symptoms, otolaryngological and vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia. Auditory perceptual assessment of voice and videolaryngoscopic examination were done. The occurrence of dysphonia and phonesthenia were observed in COVID -19 patients. Of the 106 patients, 84 patients (79%) were dysphonic, 20 (18.8%) patients were phonesthenic. The correlation of the different otolaryngological symptoms with dysphonia and phonesthenia were reported. A significant correlation was found between dysphonic patients and rhinorrhea, taste dysfunction, sore throat, and cough. A significant correlation was found between phonesthenic patients and allergic rhinitis. Videolaryngoscopic findings were detected in COVID-19 patients. Vocal fold congestion was found in 42 patients (39.6%), benign vocal fold swellings was found in 18 patients (16.9%), ventricular hypertrophy was found in 6 patients (0.05%), unilateral vocal fold immobility was found in 14 patients (13.2%), and vocal fold congestion associated with ventricular fold hypertrophy was found in 20 patients (18.8%). There was significant correlation of dysphonia and phonesthenia with vocal fold congestion (P value:0.001, P value:0.039 respectively). There was a significant correlation between cough and vocal fold congestion (P value: 0.000). Benign vocal fold swellings were associated with 18 patients (16.9%), but it was not statistically significant (P value: 0.931). Dysphonia and phonesthenia were observed in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The vocal symptoms were associated with different laryngoscopic findings, in which, vocal fold congestion was the commonest. Copyright <c2><a9> Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of anxiety on nicotine dependence among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a descriptive and correlational study. The sample consisted of 503 university students in Turkey. Data were collected online using a demographic characteristics form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)., FINDINGS: FTND scores differed by gender, family type, and grade level, while STAI scores differed by gender, income, and region of residence (p < 0.05). Fifty-one percent of the participants had moderate anxiety, while 65.2% had low nicotine dependence. FTND and STAI mean scores were strongly correlated (p < 0.05)., PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The higher the anxiety, the higher the nicotine dependence among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The main objective is to define the mortality of patients with cancer admitted to our hospital, their clinical and demographic characteristics, investigate the risk of COVID-19 for patients with cancer, and determine factors that affect the mortality rates of patients with cancer dying of COVID-19. A total of 2401 patients were admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 11th, 2020, to May 31st, 2020. Ninety-two out of a total of 112 cancer patients were included in this study based on the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria. The clinical, demographic, and laboratory features and treatments provided were studied, and their effect on mortality rates was analyzed. In our study the median age of the patients was 67 years, and 55.4% were male. More than half (56.5%) of our patients had metastasis. The mortality rate was 6.2% in the overall population with COVID-19, whereas it was 23.9% in patients with cancer. The mortality rate in patients with metastasis was statistically significantly higher compared with those without metastasis (34.0% vs. 10.3% P = 0.008). The mortality rate in patients still smoking was statistically significantly higher than in non-smokers (37.5% vs. 12.5% P = 0.033). The mortality rates of patients with high average C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer levels were statistically significantly higher than in those without, and the mortality rates of patients with lower average albumin and hemoglobin levels were statistically significantly higher than those without (P < 0.001, P = 0.006, P = 0.041, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.028, respectively). Having metastases concurrent with COVID-19 was a statistically significant factor predictive of prognosis. Also, high CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer, and low albumin and hemoglobin were related to increased mortality rates. The predictive and prognostic role of possible factors related to prognosis is still unknown and further large, multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.

AB  - Background: Various observations have suggested that the course of COVID-19 might be less favourable in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases receiving rituximab compared with those not receiving rituximab. We aimed to investigate whether treatment with rituximab is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases., Methods: In this cohort study, we analysed data from the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, which included patients aged 18 years or older with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with rituximab (rituximab group) compared with patients who did not receive rituximab (no rituximab group). Severe disease was defined as that requiring admission to an intensive care unit or leading to death. Secondary objectives were to analyse deaths and duration of hospital stay. The inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score method was used to adjust for potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body-mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure, and the underlying disease [rheumatoid arthritis vs others]). Odds ratios and hazard ratios and their 95% CIs were calculated as effect size, by dividing the two population mean differences by their SD. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353609., Findings: Between April 15, 2020, and Nov 20, 2020, data were collected for 1090 patients (mean age 55.2 years [SD 16.4]); 734 (67%) were female and 356 (33%) were male. Of the 1090 patients, 137 (13%) developed severe COVID-19 and 89 (8%) died. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, severe disease was observed more frequently (effect size 3.26, 95% CI 1.66-6.40, p=0.0006) and the duration of hospital stay was markedly longer (0.62, 0.46-0.85, p=0.0024) in the 63 patients in the rituximab group than in the 1027 patients in the no rituximab group. 13 (21%) of 63 patients in the rituximab group died compared with 76 (7%) of 1027 patients in the no rituximab group, but the adjusted risk of death was not significantly increased in the rituximab group (effect size 1.32, 95% CI 0.55-3.19, p=0.53)., Interpretation: Rituximab therapy is associated with more severe COVID-19. Rituximab will have to be prescribed with particular caution in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases., Funding: None. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has been a serious threat to global health. Previous work has focused primarily on hospitalized patients or on identifying risk factors for disease severity and mortality once the infection has taken place. We sought to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile applications to study risk factors for Covid-19 infection in a large, geographically heterogenous cohort., Methods: We analyzed data obtained from the Covid-19 Citizen Science (CCS) Study, a worldwide, mobile application-based cohort. After employing forward selection to identify variables with p values < 0.1, multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to identify independent risk factors associated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection., Results: Among 36,041 participants in 113 countries and all 50 states in the US, 484 participants had prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable adjustment, being a healthcare worker, living with at least one school-aged child, having pets at home, and having immunodeficiency were each associated with an increased odds of SARS-CoV-2. The association between pets and prevalent SARS-CoV-2 was driven by dog ownership. After adjustment for the same covariates, Asian or Pacific Islander race, receiving a flu shot within the past year, increased level of education, and smoking or vaping marijuana within the last 30 days were each associated with a lower odds of SARS-CoV-2., Conclusion: We identified various characteristics and behaviors, many of which are potentially modifiable, associated with prevalent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a world-wide mobile application-based cohort.

AB  - We continue to increase our cognizance and recognition of the importance of healthy living (HL) behaviors and HL medicine (HLM) to prevent and treat chronic disease. The continually unfolding events precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have further highlighted the importance of HL behaviors, as indicated by the characteristics of those who have been hospitalized and died from this viral infection. There has already been recognition that leading a healthy lifestyle, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a substantial protective effect in those who become infected with the virus. Now more than ever, HL behaviors and HLM are essential and must be promoted with a renewed vigor across the globe. In response to the rapidly evolving world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clear need to change lifestyle behaviors to promote human resilience and quality of life, the HL for Pandemic Event Protection (HL-PIVOT) network was established. The 4 major areas of focus for the network are: (1) knowledge discovery and dissemination; (2) education; (3) policy; (4) implementation. This HL-PIVOT network position statement provides a current synopsis of the major focus areas of the network, including leading research in the field of HL behaviors and HLM, examples of best practices in education, policy, and implementation, and recommendations for the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On April 7, 2020, Japan declared a state of emergency due to the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the associated social distancing likely to have had a great impact on older adults' lifestyle and health. This study aimed to explore the behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices in relation with background psychosocial and health characteristics of older adults during the COVID-19 emergency., METHODS: A cross-sectional telephonic survey was conducted with the participants of the Kawasaki Aging and Wellbeing Project (KAWP), an on-going longitudinal cohort study of older adults aged 85 or older. The interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire consisting of 11 closed questions regarding behavioral changes and personal hygiene practices during the state of emergency. Sociodemographic and health data were obtained from the KAWP baseline survey conducted 2.2 years before the telephonic survey., RESULTS: Overall, 487 participants from the KAWP responded to the telephonic survey (response rate: 89.2%). 94.5% of the respondents reported no changes in basic lifestyle habits, such as eating, sleeping, smoking, and drinking, whereas 28.1% reported a decrease in physical activity, and 54.6% reported going out less frequently. One-third of the respondents reported a decrease in the number of people to converse with, as well as the amount of time to converse. For personal hygiene practices, 93.8% reported wearing a mask when they went out, and 50.3% reported an increased frequency of handwashing. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that engagement in physical activity at baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.08), smartphone ownership (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.33-3.47), and visual impairment (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.10-2.91) were independently associated with decreased physical activity during the COVID-19 emergency. Female respondents and smartphone ownership were significantly associated with more frequent handwashing., CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that older adults in an urban setting responded to the COVID-19 emergency with behavioral changes. The findings of this study have implications for the design of preventive strategies to maintain the health and wellbeing of at-risk older adults.

AU  - Andreas, Stefan

AB  - In hospital, effective smoking cessation can be organized through counselling, pharmacological aids and, above all, continuous care in outpatient structures following discharge. Pharmacological treatment has proven to be effective and safe with nicotine replacement therapy as well as varenicline. Counselling plus pharmacotherapy is more effective in combination than either therapy is on its own. To better implement structures medical societies in Germany are seeking adequate funding e. g. in the DRG system for hospitalised patients. There are obvious and relevant benefits in smoking cessation. Not only for the main tobacco-related diseases such as coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), positive effects of quitting on morbidity and mortality have been confirmed by high-quality meta-analyses. Furthermore, quality of life is increasing following cessation. Presently, smoking is found to be a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality following coronavirus infection.Do e-cigarettes offer an alternative in smoking cessation? No. Animal and human data are suggesting toxic effects especially following longer use. The long-term effectiveness of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation is still uncertain and epidemiologic data clearly point toward ineffectiveness. Furthermore, dual use with potentiation of the toxic effects is common. Therefore, e-cigarettes cannot be recommended for tobacco cessation. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: The reports of neurological symptoms are increasing in cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death., METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements., RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1%), cough (76.1%), fatigue (36.1%), and shortness of breath (27.6%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6%; anosmia: 41.4%; dysguesia: 100%). They were more common among females (69.7%) and non-smokers (66.7%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8%), headaches (12.6%), and dizziness (11.9%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2% after 8 weeks and 97.3% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9%) and phantosmia (9.0%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge. The demyelinating myelitis (n = 1) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 1) were also found during follow-up., CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms were found to be prevalent among individuals with COVID-19 disease and should not be under-estimated during the current pandemic outbreak.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has overwhelmed the health systems of several countries, particularly those within the African region. Notwithstanding, the relationship between health systems and the magnitude of COVID-19 in African countries have not received research attention. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the pervasiveness of the pandemic across African countries and their Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 54 countries in five regions viz Western (16); Eastern (18); Middle (8); Northern (7); and Southern (5) Africa. The outcome variables in this study were the total confirmed COVID-19 cases (per million); total recoveries (per million); and the total deaths (per million). The data were subjected to Spearman's rank-order (Spearman's rho) correlation to determine the monotonic relationship between each of the predictor variables and the outcome variables. The predictor variables that showed a monotonic relationship with the outcome were used to predict respective outcome variables using multiple regressions. The statistical analysis was conducted at a significance level of 0.05., RESULTS: Our results indicate that total number of COVID-19 cases (per million) has strong correlations (rs >0.5) with the median age; aged 65 older; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; number of hospital beds per thousand; Human Development Index (HDI); recoveries (per million); and the overall risk environment of a country. All these factors including the country's commitments to improving national capacity were related to the total number of deaths (per million). Also, strong correlations existed between the total recoveries (per million) and the total number of positive cases; total deaths (per million); median age; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; the number of hospital beds (per thousand); and HDI. The fitted regression models showed strong predictive powers (R-squared>99%) of the variances in the total number of COVID-19 cases (per million); total number of deaths (per million); and the total recoveries (per million)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that patient-level characteristics such as ageing population (i.e., 65+), poverty, underlying co-morbidities-cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension), and diabetes through unhealthy behaviours like smoking as well as hospital care (i.e., beds per thousand) can help explain COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality rates in Africa. Aside from these, other determinants (e.g., population density, the ability of detection, prevention and control) also affect COVID-19 prevalence, deaths and recoveries within African countries and sub-regions.

AB  - Insufficient blood levels of the neurohormone vitamin D are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D's plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels < 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels < 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality.

AB  - Cigarette smoking among postpartum women remains a significant public health problem despite known health risks to women and their newborns. It is estimated that over 50% of women quit smoking during pregnancy but 90% relapse by one year. Safe and effective postpartum relapse prevention strategies are urgently needed. In an attempt to address this deficit, we will investigate the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a smoking relapse prevention aid in postpartum women. The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a relapse prevention tool. Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300 mg/day) or placebo medication for 12 weeks. To respond to safety concerns associated with participant and staff exposure to COVID-19, we revised our original protocol and present procedures which allow our trial to be conducted entirely remotely. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post-randomization. The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks. Results of this work have the potential to positively impact women and their children by promoting lifelong cessation, eliminating secondhand smoke exposure, and modelling of abstinence to children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a densely populated country with a substandard healthcare system and a mediocre economic framework. Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19's second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh., METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program., RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12%) were more affected than females (39.88%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92%; rural = 49.08%). Approximately 19% of the asymptomatic and 62% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58%), at houses (23.93%) and by traveling (12.88%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33% were isolated at home, 27.91% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63% were discharged without complications, and 0.03% has died., CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications. The current investigation would be helpful to understand the clinical manifestations and socio-demographic situations during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

AB  - AIM: This study aims to assess the stress levels, stress busters (stress relievers), and coping mechanisms among Saudi dental practitioners (SDPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak., METHODOLOGY: Self-administered questionnaire was sent to SDPs via Google forms. Cohen's stress score scale was used for stress evaluation, and the mean scores were compared based on age, gender, qualification, and occupation. In addition, comparisons of the utilization of stress coping mechanisms and stress busters based on gender, age, and occupation were evaluated. Descriptive statistics were carried out using SPSS (Version 21.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA)., RESULTS: A total of 206 SDPs (69% males and 31% females) participated in the study. Male SDPs showed a higher score than females (P>0.05). SDPs around 50 years and above obtained high-stress scores (25+/-7.4) as compared to other age groups (P<0.05). The occupational level showed higher stress scores (22.6 +/- 4.6 than the other occupation groups (P<0.05). The majority of the SDPs used watching TV/mobile/computer (80%) as a stress buster, followed by binge eating (64%), exercise (44%), smoking (32%), do it yourself (DIY-23%), and meditation (17%)., CONCLUSION: SDPs are experiencing stress levels during this COVID-19 pandemic time. Male SDPs above 50 years and private practitioners showed higher levels of stress scores. An overall commonly used stress buster was smoking in males and meditation in females.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can generate a systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions worldwide, presenting huge health and economic challenges worldwide. Several risk factors, such as age, co-infections, metabolic syndrome, and smoking have been associated with poor disease progression and outcomes. Alcohol drinking is a common social practice among adults, but frequent and/or excessive consumption can mitigate the anti-viral and anti-bacterial immune responses. Therefore, we investigated if patients with self-reported daily alcohol consumption (DAC) presented alteration in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We investigated 122 patients with COVID-19 (101 male and 46 females), in which 23 were patients with DAC (18 men and 5 women) and 99 were non-DAC patients (58 men and 41 women), without other infections, neoplasia, or immunodeficiencies. Although with no difference in age, patients with DAC presented an increase in severity-associated COVID-19 markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In addition, patients with DAC presented a reduction in the lymphocytes and monocytes counts. Importantly, the DAC group presented an increase in death rate in comparison with the non-DAC group. Our results demonstrated that, in our cohort, DAC enhanced COVID-19-associated inflammation, and increased the number of deaths due to COVID-19.

AB  - Background: This study aims to investigate the mental health of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out targeting confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Due to travel and time constraints as well as the accessibility of patients, cases were included from East Jeddah Hospital, King Abdulaziz Hospital, and the Oncology Center in Jeddah. The data were collected using a predesigned self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed COVID-19 cases, personal data, medical history, smoking, traveling abroad, and work-related conditions. Additionally, data regarding contact level with COVID-19 cases were considered. The mental health statuses of the patients were assessed using a validated Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. The study included 261 COVID-19 patients whose ages ranged from 18 to 65 years. Results: The survey findings revealed that 13% of COVID-19 patients had a borderline level of anxiety, 26.8% were considered anxiety cases, while 60.2% were normal. The findings also revealed that 29.9% had a borderline level of depression, 18.4% were considered depression cases, while 51.7% were normal. Conclusions: This study concluded that COVID-19 patients experience anxiety and depression, and as the COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread, the results of the study are particularly useful in developing a strategy to psychologically support COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic drove the Government of Bangladesh to shut down educational institutions, which had an enormous effect on the psychological health of students. This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period., Subject and methods: Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression., Results: Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students., Conclusion: This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID- 19) constitutes a major global pandemic health care system challenge. Shortly following the disease outbreak, like SARS-CoV virus, all affected countries are implementing various preventive and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. Optimizing public health system during COVID-19 pandemic requires not only advanced medical and biological sciences knowledge, but also all human sciences related to social, as well as nutritional behavior, and lifestyle practices., AIM: To investigate the effect of COVID-19- quarantine on healthy nutritional behavior and lifestyle practices among Jordanian population., METHODS: A cross-sectional study among Jordanian population was conducted using an online questionnaire between March and April 2020. Participants were kindly requested to answer a standardized and validated structured questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height); nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, snakes, water intake), and physical activity behavior were requested., RESULTS: A total of 4473 respondents were included in the study; obese (n = 1135), normal body weight (n = 1561), and underweight (n = 116). During COVID-19 quarantine, a significant increase in body weight (12.9% underweight, 28.5% normal body weight, 36.4% overweight' and 41.1% of obese (p < 0.001) was reported. Moreover, the number of snacks between meals (p < 0.001), number of main meals (p < 0.001), and the smoking rate was also increased significantly; however, there was no significant difference regarding physical activity among various weight status groups (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided evidence, for the first time, that there were significant negative changes in healthy nutritional behavior among Jordanians during COVID-19 quarantine who encountered significantly increased body weight, appetite, and smoking. Hence, future larger cross-sectional studies are warranted. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: To describe the experience of six hospitals in the management of COVID-19 patients in rural areas through an assessment of proportions, types and clinical outcomes of remote clinical interventions., METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in six Egyptian hospitals over a period five months. An emergency response was implemented in each hospital in order to connect clinical pharmacists with COVID-19 patients living in rural areas. Pharmacists used phone calls and social media applications, such as WhatsApp R to conduct two types of interventions; (a) Proactive interventions and (b) outcome-based interventions. IBM SPSS V26 was used for data analysis., RESULTS: Of the 418 patients included, 351 (83.97%) recovered, 60 (14.35%) were hospitalised and 7 (1.67%) were deceased. Medication orders per patient, high-alert medications per patient and prescribing errors per patient were 5.82, 1.45 and 0.74, respectively. Telepharmacy teams conducted 3318 phone calls, 2116 WhatsApp R chats and 1128 interventions, of which 812 (71.92%) were process-based and 316 (27.98%) were outcome-based. Among these interventions, four significant determinants of improvement in clinical outcomes were found: substitution of a prescribed drug (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54-5.87), adding a drug to the prescription (AOR = 3.15; 95% CI, 1.87-4.76), advice the patient to stop smoking (AOR = 3.53; 95% CI, 1.98-5.17) and cessation of drug therapy (AOR = 3.11; 95% CI, 1.25-4.55). The most common medications involved in drug-related interventions were Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin and Paracetamol., CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate significant impact of the remote pharmacist interventions on both medicines use and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in rural areas. Pharmacists in developing countries should be supported to implement remote clinical services to provide patients in rural places with optimal care. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has become a global burden disrupting peoples' quality of life. Students being an important cohort of a country, their mental health during this pandemic has been recognized as a concerning issue. Therefore, the prevalence and associated risk factors of Bangladeshi students' mental health sufferings (ie, depression, anxiety, and stress) are systematically reviewed herein for the first time., Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was performed from 1 to 5 April, 2021 in several databases including PubMed; and finally, a total of 7 articles were included to this review., Results: The prevalence rates of mild to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress ranged from 46.92% to 82.4%, 26.6% to 96.82%, and 28.5% to 70.1%, respectively. The risk factors concerning mental health problems included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic (younger age, gender, lower educational grade, urban residence, family size, currently living with family/parents, and having children in the family), (ii) behavior and health (smoking status, lack of physical exercise, more internet browsing time, and dissatisfaction with sleep), (iii) COVID-19 pandemic- (COVID-19 related symptoms, COVID-19 related perceptions, and fear of COVID-19 infection), (iv) miscellaneous (losing part-time teaching job, lack of study concentration, agitation, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to the hospital or home, financial problems, academic dissatisfaction, inadequate food supply, higher exposure to COVID-19 social and mass media, engaging with more recreational activities, and performing more household chores)., Conclusion: The overall assumption of mental disorders' prevalence rates can be regarded as problematic to this cohort. Thus, the authorities should consider setting up possible strategies to diminish the pandemic effect on students' mental health. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 al Mamun et al.

AB  - Purpose: An acute respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID) was identified in late 2019. COVID-19 triggered a wide range of psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. However, studies on mental health status in developing countries including Ethiopia related to COVID-19 are very limited. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the magnitude of depression, anxiety, and stress, and their associated factors among Gondar town population during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic., Patients and Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 660 residents of Gondar town in April 2020. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select study participants. A 21 item depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was used. Variables with a p-value <0.05 in the final model were declared as statistically significant. Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test was used to check the model fitness., Results: In this study, the prevalence of depression was 32.0% (95% CI: 28.4-35.5), anxiety 25.8% (95% CI: 22.4-29.1), and stress 14.7% (95% CI: 12.0-17.4), respectively. The odds of developing depression was higher among female respondents (AOR=2.30, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.83) and ever smokers (AOR=2.8, 95 CI: 1.23, 6.28) as compared to their counterparts. Besides, history of medical illness and ever smoking increase the odds of anxiety by 2.3 (AOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.42-3.76), and 2.8 (AOR=2.8; 95% CI: 1.23-3.83), respectively. Furthermore, being unemployed and family size of <5 increase the odds of stress by 2.1 (AOR=2.1; 95% CI: 1.17-3.83) and 1.8 (AOR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.09-2.81), respectively., Conclusion: In this study, the overall depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly high. There are number of factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Designing and implementing tailored strategies for COVID-19 prevention and control could be supremely important to reduce mental health problems in the community. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Akalu et al.

AB  - Introduction: The global devastating effect of COVID-19 has caused anxiety and fear to variable extent among the public. We aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, socioeconomic burden, and the mental health problems regarding anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder during COVID-19 on the general population and HCWs in Egypt., Methods: This study was conducted using a semi-structured online questionnaire in May 2020. Data on demographic features, socioeconomic scale, knowledge, and attitude regarding COVID-19 and the effect on different aspects of life were collected. Assessment was done using Arabic versions of Beck's Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory-II, and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. We divided participants into non-health care workers (non-HCWs) and HCWs groups., Results: There were 524 participants who responded to the survey from 23 governorates. More than half of the participants were females (57.4%), middle age (53%), and middle socioeconomic class (66.6%). Non-HCWs were 402 and HCWs were 122. Most participants had good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude toward protective measures particularly in HCWs. COVID-19 showed negative impact on different aspects of participants' life. HCWs had higher frequency of anxiety (32%) and OCD (29%) than non-HCWs (30% and 28%, respectively) while non-HCWs had higher depression (69%) than HCWs (66.4%). HCWs had higher rates of severe depression (20.5%) with moderate and severe OCD (4.9%, 1.6% respectively) than non-HCWs. Female gender, young age, urban residence, students, smoking, history of medical illness, and low socioeconomic class were significant associated factors., Conclusions: Health care workers had good knowledge about COVID-19 and a positive attitude toward the protective measures relative to non-HCWs. COVID-19 had a negative impact on different aspects of life and had a major association with the anxiety, depression, and OCD in both groups. Health professionals are more likely to have these psychological consequences., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s41983-021-00280-w.

AB  - In this community-based cohort study, we investigated the relationship between combinations of modifiable lifestyle risk factors and infectious disease mortality. Participants were 468,569 men and women (56.5 +/- 8.1, 54.6% women) residing in the United Kingdom. Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.

AB  - As a public health measure against COVID-19, South Africa restricted the sale of "tobacco, e-cigarettes and related products" for 5 months, ending on August 17, 2020. We examined marketing activities related to novel tobacco products (e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products) during this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661 e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June 2020. We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction saw decreased sales of heated tobacco products; mean weekly heated tobacco product sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585 kits/week) were dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the restriction (2.26 million kits/week). Lifting the restriction saw a 131% spike in sales between the latter half of August 2020 (825,638 kits) and mid-September 2020 sales (1.90 million kits), even though total sales in September 2020 were half of what was observed in the preceding year (3.81 million units in September 2020, vs 6.33 million units, September 2019). The marketing of cannabidiol and other novel products by e-cigarette manufacturers and the tobacco industry may encourage youth use; close monitoring is required. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021.

AB  - The use of electronic cigarettes among the young adult and adolescent population has increased over the past decade. Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol that is produced by heating a liquid or wax containing substances, such as nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol), flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol) using an e-cigarette. A multistate epidemic associated with vaping prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue an official health advisory on e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific diagnostic test. We present a case of EVALI before the COVID-19 pandemic time in a 23-year-old immunocompetent male student with an eight-year history of vaping. He presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient had no past medical history. The patient denied illicit drug abuse or known drug allergies. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids with a history of vaping. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella, Pneumococcal, Mycoplasma bacteria was ruled out. Influenza A/B, Parainfluenza, Rhino, and Adenoviruses were negative. A computed tomographyscan of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. He was treated with high dose steroids, empiric antibiotics, high flow oxygen and managed in ICU for seven days. The patient was discharged on tapering doses of steroid and counseled to quit vaping. EVALI outbreak is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate in vaping products. EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with a history of vaping and responds well to steroids.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Aims To investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 infection, in the periodontal tissues of deceased individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test.Sample selection Seven deceased individuals, who were admitted to the intensive care unit of the Hospital das Clinicas of the Medicine School of Sao Paulo University for invasive mechanical ventilation following a positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 test result, underwent a post-mortem examination. Individuals with comorbidities were included. Exclusion criteria included a current smoking habit. Design A cross-sectional study involving a videoscope-guided autopsy to obtain a periodontal tissue sample. The plastic body wrapping was incised in the facial region, allowing the insertion of a video endoscope. A single sample of periodontal tissue (junctional epithelium, adjacent oral epithelium and underlying connective tissue) was obtained from the mesial interproximal papilla of the maxillary first molar (or if absent, the mesial tooth). The sample was cleaned using an enzymatic detergent (Riozyme) to mimic the effects of salivary flow and was collected using blunt dissection. The sample was divided into two samples for either histopathological analysis (haematoxylin and eosin stain) or molecular analysis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to test for the presence of the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2. Data on comorbidities, smoking status, period of hospitalisation and time from onset of symptoms to death were also collected.Data analysis Descriptive analysis was performed and results were presented as a cross tabulation. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples was presented as the rRT-PCR cycle threshold value and the histopathological analysis results were Boolean (that is, presence/absence of vacuolisation or nuclear pleomorphism). Results A total of seven individuals were examined: four women and three men. The age range was 8-74 years and the range of periods between onset of symptoms and death was 10-31 days. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five samples, with a mean cycle threshold of 31.38 (range 27.28-36.55). Nuclear pleomorphism and vacuolisation were found in two and three cases, respectively. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was present in most periodontal tissue samples of individuals with COVID-19. The sample size, however, was small and only included severely ill individuals with prolonged periods of hospitalisation. Consequently, the applicability of the findings to the general population is limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious worldwide threat presented by a broad range of symptoms, from mild flu to severe pneumonia. A rising number of atypical infections have been reported. Thus, scientists and clinicians are doing hard work to unravel scientific knowledge about this novel pandemic., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to highlight the oral manifestations which could be observed in mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was performed on 665 Egyptian patients who were confirmed COVID-19-positive based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. After applying the exclusion criteria, cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The 1st section included demographic data, smoking, alcohol consumption, and general health status. The 2nd section contained questions regarding the oral hygiene status of the patients, and additionally a question about the hygienic measures they took while being infected with COVID-19. The 3rd section included questions about the most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms the patients suffered from. The 4th section included questions that referred to the oral manifestations the patients complained of while being infected with COVID-19., RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were included in this survey. It was reported that 71.7% of COVID-19 patients presented with some oral manifestations at a level of significance, with variable incidence - oral or dental pain (23%), pain in jaw bones or joint (12.0%), halitosis (10.5%), ulcerations (20.4%), and xerostomia (47.6%). Some patients (28.3%) showed 2 or 3 manifestations simultaneously., CONCLUSIONS: It was proven that mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with oral symptoms, and thus the significance of dental examination of patients with communicable diseases should be emphasized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and lifestyle behaviors of people globally. This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement., METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors., RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4 +/- 5.8 kg/m2. Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06-1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02-1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). However, our results showed a reduction in sleeping hours among those exposed to COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94; P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in food consumption and sedentary life. Being exposed to COVID-19 by direct infection or through an infected household is a significant predictor of amplifying these changes. Public health interventions are needed to address healthy lifestyle behaviors during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: We sought to investigate the outcomes associated with COVID-19 disease in cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: Of the 206 patients included, 57 had at least one preexisting malignancy. Cancer patients were older than noncancer patients. Of the 185 discharged cases, cancer patients had a significantly higher frequency of unplanned reintubation (7.1% vs 0.9%, p < 0.049), and required longer hospital stay (8.58 +/- 6.50 days versus 12.83 +/- 11.44 days, p < 0.002). Regression analysis revealed that obesity and active smoking were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusion: Outcomes in COVID-19 appear to be driven by obesity as well as active smoking, with no difference in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the insurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people died in the past several months, and the situation is ongoing with increasing health, social, and economic panic and vulnerability. As most of the countries relying on different preventive actions to control the outcomes of COVID-19, it is necessary to boost the knowledge about the effectiveness of such actions so that the policymakers take their country-based appropriate actions. This study generates evidence of taking the most impactful actions to combat COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: In order to generate community-based scientific evidence, this study analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, healthcare facilities, life expectancy, and prevalent diseases., METHODS: It used more than a hundred countries' data collected from different databases. We performed a comparative graphical analysis with non-linear correlation estimation using R., RESULTS: The reduction of COVID-19 cases is strongly correlated with the earliness of preventive initiation. The apathy of taking nationwide immediate precaution measures has been identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worse. There is significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (NCC = 0.22; p-value <= 0.001), nurses and midwives (NCC = 0.17; p-value <= 0.001), hospital beds (NCC = 0.20; p-value <= 0.001), life expectancy of both sexes (NCC = 0.22; p-value <= 0.001), life expectancy of female (NCC = 0.27; p-value <= 0.001), and life expectancy of male (NCC = 0.19; p-value <= 0.001). COVID-19 deaths were found to be reduced with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. Interestingly, no association between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 was found excluding asthma, cancer, Alzheimer's, and smoking., CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing healthcare facilities and early imposing the control measures could be valuable to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. No association between COVID-19 and other comorbidities warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level.

AB  - Most COVID-19 cases are treated as outpatients, while the majority of studies on COVID-19 focus on inpatients. Little is known about the self-reporting and self-rating of the disease's symptoms, and the associations of prophylactic use of dietary supplements with COVID-19 severity have not been addressed. The aims of this study are to evaluate COVID-19 severity and to relate them to sociodemographic characteristics and prophylactic dietary supplements. An observational patient-based study conducted through an online questionnaire on recovered COVID-19 patients. The patients were assessed for several severity parameters, sociodemographic parameters, and prophylactic dietary supplement use. A total of 428 patients were evaluated. Age and presence of comorbidities had positive associations with the severity parameters. The severe infection group had the highest proportion of patients stressed about COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Cigarette, but not hookah, smoking was significantly associated with less severe symptoms. Vitamin D negatively predicted disease severity (P < 0.05). In conclusion, stress, age, and presence of comorbidities were the most important positive predictors of COVID-19 severity, while prophylactic vitamin D use and smoking were significant negative predictors. The use of protective measures and other prophylactic dietary supplements was not significantly associated with symptom severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Sars COV-2 infection causing the covid-19 disease has started in December 2019 inWuhan, China, then spread quickly to more than 100 countries in less than 3 months. On March, 11th the WHO declared officially the pandemic of Covid 19. In the absence of an effective treatment of the SARS-Cov2 the measures of social distancing and lockdown remain the most effectives ways against the pandemic. However, these measures can have repercussions in particular on patients followed for chronic diseases, the goal of our study will be to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on non-Covid cardiac patients., METHODS: We have chosen a random sample of patients followed in the cardiology department of the CHU Tangier Tetouan Alhouceima, and we collected their demographic data as well as the symptoms, vital constants, lifestyle before and 60 days after the lockdown., RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. The average age of our population is 55.34 years+/-15.86. The average BMI (body mass index) is 26.40 Kg/m2+/-5.84. The coronary artery disease was present in 27% of the patients, valvular disease in 40% and heart failure in 37%. Finally, arrhythmias appear in 22% and more than the half of our sample has high blood pressure. We noted a significant weight gain of 1.71 Kg (P<0.000) after 60 days of lockdown, with an increase of BMI of 0,58 kg/m2 (P<0,005). The percentage of patients with SBP (systolic blood pressure) >=140mmHg has evolved from 38 to 44%, thus an increase of 6 % (P<0,0001), while the percentage of the patients with DBP (diastolic blood pressure) >=90mmHg has passed from 21 to 15 % (thus a decrease of 6 %, P<0,0001). Twenty patients stop smoking, thus a decrease of 7% (P<0,0001). The sedentary lifestyle rate presented an elevation of 22% (P<0,0001). The daily calorie intake has increased of 35,4 % and 46,8 % of the patients increased their salt intake by more than 4 g per day. The increase of the daily calorie intake concerned more the men than the women (41,9 % of men vs 31,3 % of the women). In the population with high blood pressure, we have not observed a statistically significant difference of the SBP, the DBP and the heart rate between the beginning and two months after the lockdown. Concerning patients with heart Failure, we have noted an worsen of the symptoms of HF. Thus, 8,1% of the patients presenting a stage two dyspnea has passed to a stage three of the NYHA (32,4 vs 40,5%), while the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema has increased of 13,5% but in a non-statistically significant way (P=0,267). We have noticed a diet gap with an increase of salt intakes (more than 4g per day) in more than the half of this subpopulation (55,6 %) during the period of the lockdown. In the subpopulation of patients with valvular pathology, we have identified a worsening of the dyspnea in 7,5% of the patients; this one has passed from stage two to stage three of the NHYA with an increase of the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema from 7,5% to 25% (P=0,065). Furthermore, we have noticed an incidence of 10% of cardiovascular events (2 cases of myocardial infarction [among which one has deceased], one death because of end stage heart failure, three hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, two cases of aortic dissections and 2 cases of rapid atrial fibrillation)., OUR OBSERVATION: Depending on the results of this study, the sanitary lockdown induced important repercussions on the patients followed for cardiac diseases, hence the necessity of an awareness of these patients, and mostly a restructuring of our care system strongly disturbed by the Covid 19.

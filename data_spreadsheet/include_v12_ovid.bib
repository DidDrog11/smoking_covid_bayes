	abstract = {ABSTRACT: As an international tourist center, Hainan province includes both imported and local COVID-19 cases. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hainan, China.COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Hainan affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University in January to March 2020 were retrospectively assessed. Routine blood tests, blood gas analyses, and computed tomography imaging were performed within 24 hours. Virus nucleic acid was detected every other day. The patients were divided into local resident and traveler groups, and differences in clinical data as well as leukocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil levels were analyzed.A total of 70 patients aged 51.23 +/- 13.54 years were assessed, including 16 local residents and 54 travelers. Of these, 55 cases (78.6\%) had fever, 47 (67.1\%) had cough and sputum, and 9 (12.9\%) had chest dyspnea; 60 and 10 cases were mild/common and severe/critical, respectively. Sex, basic diseases, smoking history and drinking history, Charlson Comorbidity Index, symptoms, time of onset to admission, clinical severity, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, oxygen inhalation, mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoid therapy, treatment, admission to ICU, hospital stay, and mortality were similar between the 2 groups. The warm and humid climate of Hainan does not seem to significantly affect patient features and outcomes from COVID-19. Unnecessary travel to tourist areas should be avoided.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the periods during which they used PPIs: the first group included patients who were not on PPI treatment, and the second group included those who have used PPIs for more than 4 weeks., RESULTS: The study participants were grouped according to their PPI usage history over the last 6 months. In total, 291 patients did not use any type of PPI over the last 6 months, and 91 patients used PPIs for more than 4 weeks. Older age (HR: 1.047, 95\% CI: 1.026?1.068), current smoking (HR: 2.590, 95\% CI: 1.334?5.025), and PPI therapy for more than 4 weeks (HR: 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.06?2.41) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality., DISCUSSION: The results obtained in this study show that using PPIs for more than 4 weeks is associated with negative outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Patients receiving PPI therapy should be evaluated more carefully if they are hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment.},

	abstract = {Importance: Socioeconomic factors in the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have been reported in studies from the US and other Western countries. However, no studies have documented national- or subnational-level outcome disparities in Asian countries., Objective: To assess the association between regional COVID-19 outcome disparities and socioeconomic characteristics in Japan., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study collected and analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths (through February 13, 2021) as well as population and socioeconomic data in all 47 prefectures in Japan. The data sources were government surveys for which prefecture-level data were available., Exposures: Prefectural socioeconomic characteristics included mean annual household income, Gini coefficient, proportion of the population receiving public assistance, educational attainment, unemployment rate, employment in industries with frequent close contacts with the public, household crowding, smoking rate, and obesity rate., Main Outcomes and Measures: Rate ratios (RRs) of COVID-19 incidence and mortality by prefecture-level socioeconomic characteristics., Results: All 47 prefectures in Japan (with a total population of 126.2 million) were included in this analysis. A total of 412126 confirmed COVID-19 cases (326.7 per 100000 people) and 6910 deaths (5.5 per 100000 people) were reported as of February 13, 2021. Elevated adjusted incidence and mortality RRs of COVID-19 were observed in prefectures with the lowest household income (incidence RR: 1.45 [95\% CI, 1.43-1.48] and mortality RR: 1.81 [95\% CI, 1.59-2.07]); highest proportion of the population receiving public assistance (1.55 [95\% CI, 1.52-1.58] and 1.51 [95\% CI, 1.35-1.69]); highest unemployment rate (1.56 [95\% CI, 1.53-1.59] and 1.85 [95\% CI, 1.65-2.09]); highest percentage of workers in retail industry (1.36 [95\% CI, 1.34-1.38] and 1.45 [95\% CI, 1.31-1.61]), transportation and postal industries (1.61 [95\% CI, 1.57-1.64] and 2.55 [95\% CI, 2.21-2.94]), and restaurant industry (2.61 [95\% CI, 2.54-2.68] and 4.17 [95\% CI, 3.48-5.03]); most household crowding (1.35 [95\% CI, 1.31-1.38] and 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.87-1.24]); highest smoking rate (1.63 [95\% CI, 1.60-1.66] and 1.54 [95\% CI, 1.33-1.78]); and highest obesity rate (0.93 [95\% CI, 0.91-0.95] and 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.34]) compared with prefectures with the most social advantages. Among potential mediating variables, higher smoking rate (RR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.33-1.78) and obesity rate (RR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.34) were associated with higher mortality RRs, even after adjusting for prefecture-level covariates and other socioeconomic variables., Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a pattern of socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Japan that was similar to that observed in the US and Europe. National policy in Japan could consider prioritizing populations in socially disadvantaged regions in the COVID-19 response, such as vaccination planning, to address this pattern.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalisation have yet to be clearly defined. We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors., METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25\% and 75\% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC)., FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61\%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77\% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76\% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88\% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24\%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8.61 [95\% CI 2.83-26.2; p=0.0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1.36 [1.13-1.62]; p=0.0009)., INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required., FUNDING: National Natural Science Foundation of China, UK Medical Research Council, and National Institute for Health Research Southampton Biomedical Research Centre., TRANSLATION: For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

	abstract = {Diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16\%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0\%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95\% CI 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: P = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95\% CI 2.86-3.40) for patients 20-39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95\% CI 1.06-1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95\% CI 1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95\% CI 1.12-1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.98-1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95\% CI 1.73-1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older. Our findings should be verified in other populations.},

We aim to analyze sex differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors for disease severity of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. All adults (185 cases) diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University were included in samples. The median age of all patients was 41 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) of males was relatively higher compared to females (p {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of male patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), history of smoking and drinking was higher than females. Male patients developed more clinical symptoms, obtained more abnormal laboratory test results, while they were less aware of care-seeking than female patients. There were no significant differences in clinical complications and outcomes between two groups. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.082; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.034-1.132; p = 0.001) and BMI (OR: 1.237; 95\% CI: 1.041-1.47; p = 0.016) were considered risk factors for refractory pneumonia in multivariate regression analysis. The findings of the current study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to affect older males with comorbidities.

We aimed to assess the temporal change in CXR infiltrates in a cohort of patients following hospitalisation for COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between 20th March and 3rd June 2020. Patients were approached for standard-of-care follow-up 12-weeks after hospitalisation. Inpatient and follow-up CXRs were scored by the assessing clinician for extent of pulmonary infiltrates; 0-4 per lung (Nil = 0, {\textless} 25\% = 1, 25-50\% = 2, 51-75\% = 3, {\textgreater} 75\% = 4)., RESULTS: 101 patients with paired CXRs were included. Demographics: 53\% male with a median (IQR) age 53.0 (45-63) years and length of stay 9 (5-17.5) days. The median CXR follow-up interval was 82 (77-86) days with median baseline and follow-up CXR scores of 4.0 (3-5) and 0.0 (0-1) respectively. 32\% of patients had persistent CXR abnormality at 12-weeks. In multivariate analysis length of stay (LOS), smoking-status and obesity were identified as independent risk factors for persistent CXR abnormality. Serum LDH was significantly higher at baseline and at follow-up in patients with CXR abnormalities compared to those with resolution. A 5-point composite risk score (1-point each; LOS {\textgreater}= 15 days, Level 2/3 admission, LDH {\textgreater} 750 U/L, obesity and smoking-status) strongly predicted risk of persistent radiograph abnormality (0.81)., CONCLUSION: Persistent CXR abnormality 12-weeks post COVID-19 was common in this cohort. LOS, obesity, increased serum LDH, and smoking-status were risk factors for radiograph abnormality. These findings require further prospective validation.},

To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged {\textgreater}=14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6\% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5\% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for {\textgreater}=85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were {\textless}0.5\% below 60 years of age, 1.0\% for age 60-69, and 13.2\% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45\% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5\% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4\% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.},

Association of previously published risk factors (age, gender, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity, renal failure, cardiovascular/ pulmonary diseases, serum ferritin, lymphocyte count, APTT, PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and platelet count) with death was tested by a multivariate logistic regression, and a predictive model was created, with further validation in an independent sample.

	abstract = {Background: While pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) appears to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), data on patients with CVD and concomitant cancer is limited. Evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19. Methods: Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Associationa TMs COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested. Results: Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8\%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3\%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-6.24; p{\textless}0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR=1.33, 95\%CI: 1.01 - 1.76; p=0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR=1.72, 95\%CI: 1.05-2.80; p=0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR=1.18, 95\% CI: 0.99 - 1.41; p=0.07). Conclusion: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has variable clinical, sinonasal, and smell/taste outcomes., METHODS: Observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Amman, Jordan. Demographic data, clinical presentation and smoking status were collected. Sinonasal symptoms, using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire, were evaluated. Smell/taste dysfunction was followed for three months., RESULTS: Ninety-Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty-six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3\% had cough, 52.3\% sore throat and 48.8\% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non-smokers. Smell/taste dysfunction affected 25.6\% of patients, but was the first symptom in only one patient. Fourteen of 22 symptoms in SNOT-22 had significant increase. The overall average of symptoms scores increased from 0.472 to 1.034, with smell/taste dysfunction to have the most increment. The latter symptom recovered completely in 81\% and dysgeusia developed in 9.5\% at three months, and it recovered completely in all patients at six months., CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 may produce severe lower airways disease, it has modest effect on nose and paranasal sinuses. Moreover, smell/taste dysfunction is a prominent symptom, but it usually recovers dramatically. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43\%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4\% vs 13.5\%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9\% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1\% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2\% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure.},

	abstract = {Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) commonly complicates SARS-CoV-2 infection but there is heterogeneity in incidence and mortality in the single center reports and risk factors. Purpose To determine the incidence of PE in COVID-19 and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods Electronic medical records were searched retrospectively for demographic, clinical and laboratory data and outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 at 4 hospitals March-June 2020. PE on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and perfusion scintigraphy was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. D-dimer was used to predict PE and the obtained threshold underwent an external validation on 85 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a 5th hospital. We also assessed the association between right heart strain and embolic burden in patients with PE undergoing echocardiography. Results Four-hundred-thirteen patients with COVID-19 (230 men, aged 20-98 years, mean + SD = 60+16 years) were evaluated. PE was diagnosed in 25\% (102/413, 95\%CI: 21\%-29\%) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, undergoing CTPA or perfusion scintigraphy. PE was observed in 29\% (21/73, 95\%CI:19\% -41\%) of ICU vs. 24\% (81/340, 95\%CI:20\% -29\%) of non-ICU patients (p=0.37). PE was associated with male sex(Odds Ratio=OR[95\% CI]: 1.7[1.1-2.8], p=0.02), smoking (OR[95\% CI]:1.8[1.01-3.4], p=0.04) and increased d-dimer (p{\textless}0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p{\textless}0.001), ferritin (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p=0.02). Mortality in hospitalized patients was similar between those with PE and without PE (14\%[13/102, 95\%CI: 8\% - 22\%]vs 13\%[40/311, 95\%CI: 9\% - 17\%], p=0.98), suggesting that diagnosis and treatment of PE was not associated with excess mortality. D-dimer{\textgreater}1600 ng/mL predicts PE with 100\% sensitivity and 62\% specificity in an external validation cohort. Embolic burden was higher in patients with right heart strain among the patients with PE undergoing echocardiogram (p=0.03). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism incidence was 25\% in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suspected of PE. D-dimer{\textgreater}1600ng/mL was sensitive for identifying which patients need CTPA.

In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD., RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60\%) were male. Overall, 40\% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12\%) and asthma (n=19, 15\%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6\% vs. 5.5\%, P{\textless}0.05) in these patients., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40\% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 among IBD patients; its influence on disease severity and outcome; its relationship to medication use and how the pandemic affected IBD management., METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was posted online to members of the Israel Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Foundation (November 2020-January 2021). The questionnaire addressed the course of IBD disease and COVID-19 infection over the past year., RESULTS: Total 2152 IBD patients completed the questionnaire. Of which 104 (4.8\%) had been infected with COVID-19, significantly lower than the 'expected' infected cases among the Israeli population (P = 0.033). The median age of participants was 39 years; 60.5\% were female. Most patients (75.6\%) had no comorbidities other than IBD. No correlation was found between IBD type or disease severity and COVID-19 infection. Most IBD patients reported mild COVID-19 disease, regardless of the type of IBD medications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, elevated BMI and diabetes were independent risk factors for COVID-19 infection. IBD treatment methods including 5-aminosalicylic acid, smoking and hypertension were protective factors. In total 25.2\% of COVID-19 patients discontinued their IBD treatment, compared to 8.5\% of non-COVID-19-infected patients. IBD flares were significantly higher in those who discontinued treatment (P {\textless} 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients do not have an increased risk for COVID-19, regardless of IBD activity or treatment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors., RESULTS: OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95\% CI 2.76 - 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Anosmia is a common debilitating symptom of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia., METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9\% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group., RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23-37). Among them, 198 (71.7\%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8\%) of participants. In this study, 83\% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8-18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95\% CI 0.68-1.14; P = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia. Further clinical trials, which take these covariates into account, will need to be undertaken. The trail has been registered at ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT04569825.

We aimed to evaluate the socio-clinical characteristics and outcome of various options of treatment of individuals with parosmia due to COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at two main Hospitals in the Ramadi and Tikrit cities, Iraq, on patients with a chief complaint of parosmia due to COVID-19 disease. The study involved 7 months (August 2020-February 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5\%) females. The majority were from age group {\textless}= 30 years (n = 188, 70.1\%), housewives (n = 150, 56\%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8\%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2\%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3\%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9\%) or hyposmia (10.1\%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7\%). Around 3 quarters of the cases were presented in {\textless}= 4 months. Altered quality of life (AQL) was presented in 91.8\% of subjects, and there was a significant association with the presence of dysgeusia and type and severity of parosmia. The smoking habit didn't show a significant association with AQL, the severity of parosmia, and the recovery rate. Most of the odor group was the most triggering stimuli eliciting parosmia, while, the sewage was the response odor in above 50\% of the cases. The recovery rate was poor with olfactory training plus either tonics or local and systemic steroids. Parosmia due to COVID-19 infection is a common problem with poor results in the short-term treatment and follow-up. The AQL was seen in a greater proportion of patients and strongly associated with the presence of dysgeusia, type, and severity of parosmia.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gender-related factors might affect vulnerability to Covid-19. The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients., METHODS: Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization., RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6\%) with a mean age of 67.0 +/- 14.5 years (vs 67.8 +/- 12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO2/FiO2 was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134-273] vs 238 mmHg [150-281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7\% vs 13.0\%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1\% in women and 38.1\% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687)., CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.},

This study aimed at determining the association between presence of chronic diseases and smoking behaviors with the development of ARDS among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah-affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.},

The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19., RESULTS: There were a total of 154 (0.2\%) and 667 (0.3\%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95\% confidence interval 0.5-0.6; p {\textless} .0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.4\% versus 22.5\%; p {\textless} .0001), acute kidney injury (48.7\% versus 31.0\%; p {\textless} .0001), acute myocardial infarction (11\% versus 6.4\%; p = .048), sepsis (41.6\% versus 22.5\%; p {\textless} .0001), and respiratory failure (61.7\% versus 42.3\%; p {\textless} .0001) were significantly higher among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with that among those without COVID-19 (40.3\% versus 19.0\%; p {\textless} .0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that rates of intracerebral hemorrhage are higher in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of comorbidities and adverse in-hospital events.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The association between smoking status and severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial., OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hospitalization (as a marker of severe COVID-19) in patients by smoking status: former, current and never smokers, who tested positive for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) at an academic medical center in the United States., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status., RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2\%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8\%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2\% former smokers; 7.3\% current smokers; 10.4\% never smokers, p{\textless}0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95\% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95\% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95\% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Consecutive adult patients diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reference Hospitals were contacted to complete a survey reporting chemosensory loss, severity, timing and duration, nasal symptoms, smoking, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. In a cross-sectional study, we contacted 182 patients and 150 responded. Excluding the critically ill patients, 38\% reported gustatory and 41\% olfactory impairment (74\% severe/anosmia). Most of the patients (88\%) recovered their sense of smell by two months (median: 11.5 days; IQR: 13.3). For 23\%, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. There were no significant differences in the prevalence and duration of chemosensory loss between groups of varying COVID-19 severity, and sexes (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Moderate hyposmia resolved quicker than more severe loss (p = 0.04). Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent in COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background: Several papers have shown contradictory evidence about the relationship between smoking and COVID-19-related deaths. There is little evidence about smoking and risk of infection. We aim to examine association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality., Methods: This was a prospective study with participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Participants who lived in England were followed up from 01/02/2020 to 28/06/2020 with data linked to hospital episode statistics, Office for National Statistics and Public Health England PCR tests. We compared current-smokers, previous-smokers with never-smokers and estimated risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality using Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index and socio-economic status. Interactions between smoking status and age and sex were tested for using multiplicative interactions, and analyses were stratified by median age (49-68 years, 69-86 years) and sex., Results: In total, 402,978 participants were included in the analyses. The majority were never smokers, 226,294 (56.2\%), 140,090 (34.8\%) were previous smokers, and 39,974 (9.9\%) current smokers. COVID-19 infection was identified in 1591 (0.39\%) people, and 372/1591 (23.4\%) died. Amongst the younger participants, smokers were nearly twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19 than never smokers (RR 1.88 [1.49-2.38]) whereas there was no difference for those aged 69+ (RR 1.05 [0.82-1.34]). In contrast, amongst the older participants, smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-smokers (RR 2.15 [1.11-4.16]) whereas there was no difference for those under the age of 69 (RR 1.22[0.83-1.79]). Similar patterns were observed for previous smokers. The impact of smoking was similar in men and women., Conclusion: The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent death is modified by age. Smokers and previous smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with increased exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus. Once infected, older smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than never smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of chronic conditions/illnesses.

However, it remains controversial with respect to the relationship of smoking with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of smoking in COVID-19., Methods: A total of 622 patients with COVID-19 in China were enrolled in the study. Corresponding clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were employed to analyze the association of smoking with survival in patients with COVID-19., Results: Smoking was statistically significant comparing non-survivors and survivors of patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.007). Males had higher proportion of smoking than females (91.9\% vs. 8.1\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the non-smoker, there was significant statistical difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in smoking patients with COVID-19 (9.7\% vs. 3.4\%, P = 0.017). White blood cell count (6.3 vs. 5.4; P = 0.037), hemoglobin level (139.0 vs. 127.0; P {\textless} 0.001), and creatinine level (77.3 vs. 61.0; P {\textless} 0.001) were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients who smoked. Moreover, smoking patients showed a worse survival compared with non-smoking patients (Log Rank P = 0.045). After adjustment for age, gender and underlying diseases, patients with smoking still had higher risk of mortality than that of non-smoking patients (hazard ratio[HR] 1.897, 95\% confidence interval [CI]1.058-3.402, P = 0.032)., Conclusion: Smoking was thought to be a risk factor in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 and smoking patients might have a higher risk of mortality than that of the non-smoking patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these two groups., METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care (Intensive Care National Audit \& Research Centre Case Mix Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status; and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index, deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported information on types and duration of organ support for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups., FINDINGS: The primary care cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 117 926 (59.4\%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0.4\%) were admitted to CCU, and 899 (0.4\%) died within 28 days. The critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of these, 2685 (62.8\%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15.5\%) died at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.15 (95\% CI 1.75-2.65) for CCU admission and 1.65 (1.36-2.01) for 28-day mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0.91 (0.76-1.09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with those with non-B.1.1.7 infection., INTERPRETATION: Patients with lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and 28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and infection with COVID-19., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the Medical Sciences Division of the University of Oxford.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 infected patients has been soaring in the Middle East countries. The disease poses a significant threat, decisions about prioritizing care should be made in accordance with the proven risk factors for complications., OBJECTIVE: The present study provides the first bespoke prediction model in the Middle East to identify COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for complications., METHOD: A case-control study design was adopted to compare the characteristics of successfully recovered patients with those who had complications. Complications were defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, sepsis or septic shock, pneumonia or respiratory failure, and death. The prediction model was created through multivariable logistic regression. Overall statistical significance tests for the model were carried out., RESULTS: All COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients (n = 133) in Amman - Jordan were included in the study. Successfully recovered were 125 patients. The median age (IRQ) was 26 (10-40). Almost 30\% were {\textgreater}40 years. Patients with complications were eight patients, age 63 (51.5-71.5). The prediction model identified the following variables as risk factors: diabetes (OR = 59.7; 95\% CI: 3.5-1011.5, p = 0.005), fever (OR = 24.8; 95\% CI: 1.4-447.3, p = 0.029), SHORTNESS OF BREATH (OR = 15.9; 95\% CI: 1.3-189.7, p = 0.029), body mass index (OR = 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.61-0.88, p = 0.001), abnormal Neutrophils (OR = 16.8; 95\% CI: 1.0-292.0, p = 0.053). Prediction model was statistically significant, chi2(5) = 86.1, p {\textless} 0.0005., CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports from China, the most influential variables that led to disease progression in Jordanian patients were diabetes, fever, shortness of breath, body mass index, and abnormal neutrophils. Similar to reports from the USA, smoking was not a leading factor for complications. Comorbidities and patient health status, rather than age, were the primary risk factors for complications. Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine showed no protective effect. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Respiratory failure is the major cause of death in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Data on factors affecting the need for oxygen therapy in early-stage COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with the need for oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19. This is a retrospective study of consecutive COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between February 27 and June 28, 2020, in South Korea. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the need for oxygen therapy.Of the 265 patients included in the study, 26 (9.8\%) received oxygen therapy, and 7 of these patients (29.2\%) were transferred to a step-up facility, and 3 (11.5\%) died. The median age of all patients was 46 years (IQR, 30-60 years), and the median modified early warning score at admission was 1 (IQR, 1-2). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, being a current smoker (odds ratio [OR] 7.641, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.686-34.630, P = .008), heart rate (OR 1.053, 95\% CI 1.010-1.097, P = .014), aspartate aminotransferase values (OR 1.049, 95\% CI 1.008-1.092, P = .020), blood urea nitrogen levels (OR 1.171, 95\% CI 1.073-1.278, P {\textless} .001), and chest radiographic findings (OR 3.173, 95\% CI 1.870-5.382, P {\textless} .001) were associated with oxygen therapy. In patients with less severe COVID-19, the need for oxygen therapy is affected by smoking and elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen. Further research is warranted on the risk factors for deterioration in COVID-19 to efficiently allocate medical resources.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60 +/- 14 years, 67.5\% males); 23\% of patients had no known comorbidities. The overall ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 24.4\%. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 7 (25-75\% interquartile range: 4-10) and 10 (25-75\% interquartile range: 7-14) days, respectively. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital death as the dependent variable, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death, whereas greater PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was associated with a lower risk., CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, history of smoking, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.

The data included: date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, medications (active COVID-19 agents), weight and height (from which the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, history of smoking, and comorbid conditions to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) multi-morbidity score. An additional COVID-19 Risk Score was also included. Outcomes included hospital admission, ICU admission, and death., RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact on mortality or hospital admission. Age, sex, and race (white/Latino, white/non-Latino, other, did not disclose) were adjusted for in the model. Patients with higher COVID-19 Risk Scores had a significantly higher likelihood of being at least admitted to the hospital (HR = 1.80; 95\% CI = 1.30, 2.50; P {\textless} .001), or experiencing death or inpatient admission (includes ICU admissions) (HR = 1.20; 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.42; P = .028). Age was the only statistically significant demographic predictor, but obesity was not a significant predictor of any of the outcomes., CONCLUSION: Age and COVID-19 Risk Scores were significant predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Asymptomatic active infection might be an important contributor to the COVID-19 outbreak. Serological tests can assess the extent of exposure and herd immunity to COVID-19 in general populations. This study aimed to estimate the nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, sex and clinical status in South Korea., DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany)., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39\% (95\% CI=0.20\% to 0.58\%): 0.30\% (95\% CI=0.06\% to 0.54\%) for men and 0.48\% (95\% CI=0.18\% to 0.78\%) for women. The rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity varied significantly between different regions of Korea (p=0.003), but not with age group, sex, or the statuses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension or smoking., CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Korean population is still immunologically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but the seroprevalence has increased relative to that found in studies performed prior to September 2020 in Korea.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking negatively impacts COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. Evidence on whether smoking is associated with SARS-Co-V2 infection and having a positive test is scarce, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, where most of the world's billion smokers live. The inconsistency in relevant findings calls for study designs and analyses to account for possible confounders including background characteristics and pre-existing co-morbidities, to disentangle the specific effect of smoking. In healthcare workers (HCWs) the frequency of exposure to COVID-19 cases adds another layer of risk that was not factored in previous studies. We examined the association of HCWs' tobacco/nicotine use (never, former, and current use) with having a positive SARS-Co-V2 test result and symptoms suggestive of infection, accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 4040 healthcare workers with baseline and follow-up screening took place during April-June 2020 in 12 healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt. Data on demographics, tobacco/nicotine use (manufactured or roll-your-own cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and electronic devices), co-morbidities, symptoms, exposures, and SARS-Co-V2 investigations were analyzed. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Overall, 270/4040 (6.7, 95\%CI: 5.9-7.5) had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 479 (11.9\%) were current and 79 (2.0\%) were former tobacco/nicotine users. The proportion of positive tests was 7.0\% (243/3482, 95\%CI: 6.1-7.8) among never, 5.1\% (4/79, 95\%CI: 0.1-10.0) among former, and 4.8\% (23/479, 95\%CI: 2.9-6.7) among current users. HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 test results did not vary significantly by single/multiple or daily/non-daily tobacco/nicotine use. Compared to never users, former users were more likely to self-report a pre-existing medical condition (ORadjusted1.87, 95\%CI: 1.05-3.33, p = 0.033), and to experience symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (ORadjusted1.76, 95\%CI: 1.07-2.90, p = 0.027). After adjustment, former (ORadjusted0.45, 95\%CI: 0.11-1.89, p = 0.273) and current (ORadjusted0.65, 95\%CI: 0.38-1.09, p = 0.101) tobacco/nicotine use was not associated with HCWs' SARS-CoV-2 positive test results., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on this association from low- and middle-income countries with high tobacco/nicotine use prevalence. In this HCW cohort, having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was not associated with tobacco/nicotine use after accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities. Additional population-based studies could use such preliminary evidence to investigate this controversial association.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as confinement and social interaction limitations that paradoxically may have aggravated healthcare access disparities for pregnant women and accentuated health system weaknesses addressing high-risk patients' pregnancies. Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19., METHODS: A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020-February 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution., RESULTS: Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8\% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93\% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5\% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of {\textless} 19 or {\textgreater} 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60\% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4\% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8\%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death. Measures are needed to improve access to coordinated well-organized healthcare to reduce maternal deaths related to COVID-19 and pandemic collateral effects.},

Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19. This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6\% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention. Public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use are also needed.},

We therefore investigated the impact of shift work on significant COVID-19 illness., METHODS: 501 000 UK Biobank participants were linked to secondary care SARS-CoV-2 PCR results from Public Health England. Healthcare worker occupational testing and those without an occupational history were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression (age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation index) revealed that irregular shift work (OR 2.42, 95\% CI 1.92 to 3.05), permanent shift work (OR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.95 to 3.19), day shift work (OR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.55 to 2.6), irregular night shift work (OR 3.04, 95\% CI 2.37 to 3.9) and permanent night shift work (OR 2.49, 95\% CI 1.67 to 3.7) were all associated with positive COVID-19 tests compared with participants that did not perform shift work. This relationship persisted after adding sleep duration, chronotype, premorbid disease, body mass index, alcohol and smoking to the model. The effects of workplace were controlled for in three ways: (1) by adding in work factors (proximity to a colleague combined with estimated disease exposure) to the multivariate model or (2) comparing participants within each job sector (non-essential, essential and healthcare) and (3) comparing shift work and non-shift working colleagues. In all cases, shift work was significantly associated with COVID-19. In 2017, 120 307 UK Biobank participants had their occupational history reprofiled. Using this updated occupational data shift work remained associated with COVID-19 (OR 4.48 (95\% CI 1.8 to 11.18)., CONCLUSIONS: Shift work is associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital COVID-19 positivity. This risk could potentially be mitigated via additional workplace precautions or vaccination. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed., RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 53\% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66\% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58\% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68\%), obesity (65\%), and diabetes mellitus (31\%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76\%), cough (75\%), and fever (64\%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19\% died (67\% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black. On multivariate analysis, ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-28.6) and history of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95\% CI 1.5-24.3) were associated with mortality, and those admitted from home were less likely to die (vs outside facility, OR 0.2, 95\% CI 0.0-0.7). Neither age, sex, race, body mass index, insurance status, nor rural residence was independently associated with mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds evidence that Black patients appear to be overrepresented in those hospitalized with and those who die from COVID-19, likely a manifestation of adverse social determinants of health.

Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases)., RESULTS: From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6\%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3\% vs 7.3\%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5\%, p{\textless}0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6\%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9\%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5\%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p{\textless}0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95\% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95\% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2\%) HCWs with positive IgG levels. Declared exposure to a suspected/confirmed case was more frequently associated (p{\textless}0.001) with positive serology when the contact was a family member (19/94, 20.2\%) than a patient or colleague (78/888, 8.8\%)., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred undetected in a large fraction of HCWs and it was not associated with working in COVID-19 frontline areas. Beyond the hospital setting, exposure within the community represents an additional source of infection for HCWs.

	abstract = {Importance: Low vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Independent, well-powered studies could further our understanding of this association., Objective: To examine whether low levels of vitamin D are associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, an indicator of previous infection., Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a cohort study of employees and spouses who elected to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG as part of an annual employer-sponsored health screening program conducted in August to November 2020. This program includes commonly assessed demographic, biometric, and laboratory variables, including total vitamin D measurement. Baseline (prepandemic) levels of vitamin D and potential confounders were obtained from screening results from the previous year (September 2019 to January 2020). Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to March 2021., Exposures: Low total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, defined as either less than 20 ng/mL or less than 30 ng/mL., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as determined with US Food and Drug Administration emergency use-authorized assays. The association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with vitamin D levels was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score analyses., Results: The 18148 individuals included in this study had test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in 2020 and vitamin D levels from the prepandemic and pandemic periods. Their median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-56) years, 12170 (67.1\%) were women, 900 (5.0\%) were seropositive, 4498 (24.8\%) had a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, and 10876 (59.9\%) had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before the pandemic. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking status, and geographical location, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL before (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.22) or during (OR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.09) the pandemic; it was also not associated with having a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL before (OR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.27) or during (OR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.91-1.23) the pandemic. Similar results were observed in propensity score analyses. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was associated with obesity (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.46), not having a college degree (OR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.62), and Asian (OR, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.87), Black (OR, 2.74; 95\% CI, 2.25-3.34), Hispanic (OR, 2.65; 95\% CI, 2.15-3.27), American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (OR, 2.01; OR, 1.54-2.62) race/ethnicity, and was inversely associated with high blood pressure (OR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.70-0.96), smoking (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.47-0.78), and residing in the US Northeast (OR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.92) and West (OR, 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.67)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was not associated with low levels of vitamin D independently of other risk factors.},

We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of stroke in Black patients with COVID-19 compared to their non-Black counterparts while adjusting for the major potential confounders., RESULTS: Among 8815 patients with ED visits with COVID-19, 77 (0.87\%), 95\% confidence interval CI (95\% CI): 0.69\% to 1.10\%) had ischemic stroke. The mean age of patients with stroke was 64 years (SD: 2 years); 28 (43\%) were men, 55 (71\%) had hypertension, and 29 (50\%) were Black. The prevalence of ischemic stroke in Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics was 1.26\% (95\% CI: 0.86\% to 1.83\%), 0.84\% (95\% CI: 0.51\% to 1.37\%) and 0.49\% (95\% CI: 0.26\% to 0.88\%) respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, drinking and smoking, the likelihood of stroke was higher in Black than non-Black patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 7.15, p=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in the prevalence of stroke among patients with COVID-19 exist, higher in Black population.

We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95\%CI 3.8-5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95\%CI 1.1-5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aimed to evaluate the association between smoking and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted using a large nationwide database. The case group included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the control group was randomly sampled from the general Korean population in the National Health Insurance Service database by matching sex, age, and region of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status., RESULTS: A total of 4,167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20,937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6\% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.62). When ex-smokers and current smokers were analysed separately, similar results were obtained (current smoker OR = 0.33, CI = 0.28-0.38; ex-smoker OR = 0.81, CI = 0.72-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that smoking may not be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking tends to lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution., IMPLICATIONS: It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019. In this large nationwide study in South Korea, smoking tended to lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further confirmatory studies are required. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care., METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50\% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables., RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age{\textgreater}50 years, measured temperature{\textgreater}37.5degreeC, oxygen saturation{\textless}95\%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6\% (94.8-96.3\%), specificity of 20.0\% (19.0-21.0\%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., {\textgreater}75\% probability with +5 or more points)., CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.},

We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population., METHODS: Between 22 June 22 and 15 August 2020, HCWs from institutions in northern/eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity., RESULTS: Among 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3\%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95\% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-3.1).

Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.2-2.9) and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.4-3.8)., DISCUSSION: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCWs. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.

E-cigarette and conventional cigarette use were ascertained using a novel electronic health record tool, and COVID-19 diagnosis was ascertained by a validated institutional registry. Logistic regression models were fit to assess whether current e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. A total of 69,264 patients who were over the age of 12 years, smoked cigarettes or vaped, and were sought medical care at Mayo Clinic between September 15, 2019 and November 30, 2020 were included. The average age was 51.5 years, 62.1\% were females and 86.3\% were white; 11.1\% were currently smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes and 5.1\% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who used only e-cigarettes were not more likely to have a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.93 [0.69-1.25], P = .628), whereas those who used only cigarettes had a decreased risk (OR 0.43 [0.35-0.53], P {\textless} .001). The OR for dual users fell between these 2 values (OR 0.67 [0.49-0.92], P = .013). Although e-cigarettes have the well-documented potential for harm, they do not appear to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result suggests the hypothesis that any beneficial effects of conventional cigarette smoking on susceptibility are not mediated by nicotine.},

When compared with age of 30-40 years, the age group of 10-20 years were most likely to present with smell or taste dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 6.59, 95\% CI 1.32-26.12; P = 0.01). The majority of specific comorbidities were not associated with increased incidence of smell or taste dysfunction. Outpatient healthcare workers were more likely to present with smell or taste loss (OR 3.2, CI 1.8-5.47; P {\textless} 0.001). The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with smell or taste dysfunction was significantly lower than those without (0\% vs. 20.3\%; P {\textless} 0.001). Smell or taste loss is more prevalent in women, younger age groups, and healthier individuals. It may be associated with lower mortality and a milder disease trajectory compared to the overall cohort. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We examine risk for co-infection among construction and agricultural workers, incarcerated persons, Black and Latino populations, and persons living in high dust areas. We further identify common risk factors for co-infection, including older age, diabetes, immunosuppression, racial or ethnic minority status, and smoking. Because these diseases cause similar symptoms, the COVID-19 pandemic might exacerbate delays in coccidioidomycosis diagnosis, potentially interfering with prompt administration of antifungal therapies. Finally, we examine the clinical implications of co-infection, including severe COVID-19 and reactivation of latent coccidioidomycosis. Physicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a possible diagnosis when treating patients with respiratory symptoms. Preventive measures such as wearing face masks might mitigate exposure to dust and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, thereby protecting against both infections.},

Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection at Wuhan Union Hospital, between February 8 and March 31, 2020, were included in the study analysis. General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records. Participants ' responses to self-report measures of psychological status were also collected. Results: Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.

Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remain understudied., METHODS: We used a multicenter federated research network to compare clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SOT to a propensity--matched cohort of patients without SOT., RESULTS: We identified 2307 SOT recipients and 231 047 nontransplant patients with COVID-19. Transplant patients were more likely to be male individuals, older, have a body mass index {\textgreater}30 kg/m2, and have comorbid hypertension, diabetes, nicotine dependence, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease compared with the nontransplant group (P {\textless} 0.05). One-to-one matching was performed for diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, race, nicotine dependence, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and gender. There was no difference in the composite outcome of intubation or mechanical ventilation at 30 days (risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.26) or 60 days (RR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.24) between the 2 groups. Hospitalization rate was higher in the transplant cohort (30.97\% versus 25.47\%; RR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.34). There was no difference in mortality at 30 days (6.45\% versus 5.29\%; RR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.68) or 60 days postdiagnosis (RR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.32). More patients in the SOT group developed acute renal injury compared with non-SOT cohort (24.73\% versus 14.29\%; RR, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.53-1.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SOT have high COVID-19-related mortality; however, propensity-matched analyses reveal that this increased risk is secondary to higher burden of comorbidities.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered a widespread concern in global public health. Diagnoses of COVID-19 in some cases are necessary because of severe prognosis. In this study, epidemiologies, clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were studied in Taleghani Hospital, Urmia, Iran., METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was carried out on 215 patients with COVID-19 during March and April 2020. Approved COVID-19 case was considered as a person with a positive respiratory sample performed by at least one of two RT-PCR methods or genetic sequencing. ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P {\textless} .05 was considered significant., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93 +/- 17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3\%) and 124 males (57.7\%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91 +/- 3.68 days, 37.40 +/- 0.96degreeC and 5.88 +/- 4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2\% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5\%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8\% and 49.3\% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33\%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5\%-25\% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50\%-75\% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P = .085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement and suffering from fever (P {\textgreater} .05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24\% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80\% (95\% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.014-1.528; P = .037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P = .043)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25\%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1\% can improve the patients by 24\%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The longevity of antibody levels against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the duration of immunity are current topics of major scientific interest. Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months., RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8\% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smell and taste loss are characteristic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients., METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates., RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6\%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95\% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95\% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95\% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95\% CI 0.06-0.76)., CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim was to examine the association between pre-existing mental health diagnosis and COVID-19 outcomes (positive screen, hospitalization, mortality)., METHODS: Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes., RESULTS: Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95\%CI 0.57-0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.70-0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models. Adults with bipolar disorder had significantly higher odds of hospitalization in fully adjusted models (OR 4.27, 95\% CI 2.06-8.86), and odds of hospitalization were significantly higher among those with externalizing disorders after adjusting for demographics (OR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.23-2.38). Mortality was significantly higher in the fully adjusted model for patients with bipolar disorder (hazard ratio 2.67, 95\% CI 1.07-6.67)., CONCLUSIONS: Adults with mental health disorders, while less likely to test positive for COVID-19, were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in the hospital. Study results suggest the importance of developing interventions that incorporate elements designed to address smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity counseling and other needs specific to this population to improve COVID-19 outcomes.},

This dual-center retrospective cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of depression in young adults during this pandemic and explored its association with various physical fitness measures., Methods: This study enrolled 12,889 (80\% female) young adults (mean age 20 +/- 1) who performed a National Student Physical Fitness battery from December 1st, 2019, to January 20th, 2020, and completed a questionnaire including Beck's Depression Inventory in May 2020. Independent associations between prior physical fitness and depression during the pandemic were assessed using multivariable linear and binary logistic regressions accordingly, covariates including age, dwelling location, economic level, smoking, alcohol, living status, weight change, and exercise volume during the pandemic. Sex- and baseline stress-stratified analyses were performed., Results: Of the study population 13.9\% of men and 15.0\% of women sampled qualified for a diagnosis of depression. After multivariable adjustment, anaerobic (mean change 95\% CI -3.3 [-4.8 to 1.8]) aerobic (-1.5 [-2.64 to -0.5]), explosive (-1.64 [-2.7 to -0.6]) and muscular (-1.7 [-3.0 to -0.5]) fitness were independently and inversely associated with depression for the overall population. These remained consistent after sex- and baseline stress-stratification. In binary logistic regression, the combined participants with moderate, high or excellent fitness also showed a much lower risk compared to those least fit in anaerobic (odd ratio (OR) 95\% CI 0.68 [0.55-0.82]), aerobic (0.80 [0.68-0.91]), explosive (0.72 [0.61-0.82]), and muscular (0.66 [0.57-0.75]) fitness., Conclusions: These findings suggest that prior physical fitness may be inversely associated with depression in young adults during a pandemic.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been highlighted as important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019)., METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95\% CIs., FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (1.8\%) of the 502 505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493 295 individuals. During 5 273 731 person-years of follow-up (median 10.9 years [IQR 10.1-11.6] per participant), 27 729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5\%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.46-0.87) and non-infection death (0.80, 0.75-0.86). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 7.59, 95\% CI 5.92-9.73, for infection death vs 5.21, 4.97-5.48, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 3.69, 3.19-4.26, vs 2.52, 2.44-2.61), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 2.13, 1.78-2.56, vs 1.38, 1.33-1.43), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 2.21, 1.74-2.82, vs 1.55, 1.44-1.66), hypertension (1.36, 1.22-1.53, vs 1.15, 1.12-1.18), respiratory disease (2.21, 1.96-2.50, vs 1.28, 1.24-1.32), chronic kidney disease (5.04, 4.28-7.31, vs 2.50, 2.20-2.84), psychiatric disease (1.56, 1.30-1.86, vs 1.23, 1.18-1.29), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (2.45, 1.99-3.02, vs 1.41, 1.32-1.51). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 9.53, 6.97-13.03) than of non-infection death (5.26, 4.84-5.72)., INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups., FUNDING: British Heart Foundation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric disorders are exposed to high risk of COVID-19 and increased mortality. In this study, we set out to assess the clinical features and outcomes of patients with current psychiatric disorders exposed to COVID-19., METHODS: This multi-center prospective study was conducted in 22 psychiatric wards dedicated to COVID-19 inpatients between 28 February and 30 May 2020. The main outcomes were the number of patients transferred to somatic care units, the number of deaths, and the number of patients developing a confusional state. The risk factors of confusional state and transfer to somatic care units were assessed by a multivariate logistic model. The risk of death was analyzed by a univariate analysis., RESULTS: In total, 350 patients were included in the study. Overall, 24 (7\%) were transferred to medicine units, 7 (2\%) died, and 51 (15\%) patients presented a confusional state. Severe respiratory symptoms predicted the transfer to a medicine unit [odds ratio (OR) 17.1; confidence interval (CI) 4.9-59.3]. Older age, an organic mental disorder, a confusional state, and severe respiratory symptoms predicted mortality in univariate analysis. Age {\textgreater}55 (OR 4.9; CI 2.1-11.4), an affective disorder (OR 4.1; CI 1.6-10.9), and severe respiratory symptoms (OR 4.6; CI 2.2-9.7) predicted a higher risk, whereas smoking (OR 0.3; CI 0.1-0.9) predicted a lower risk of a confusional state., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with severe psychiatric disorders have multiple somatic comorbidities and have a risk of developing a confusional state. These data underline the need for extreme caution given the risks of COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors and frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs., METHODS: We conducted this retrospective case-control study of 3100 HCWs between May and July 2020. HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were the cases (n=506) and those negative for SARS-CoV-2 were the controls (n=253). Univariate analysis was followed by multivariate analysis of key demographic, clinical and infection control variables., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 16.32\% of HCWs. Nearly 45\% of infected HCWs were asymptomatic. The proportions of sanitation workers (24\% vs 8\%; p{\textless}0.0001) and technicians (10\% vs 4\%; p=0.0002) were higher and that of doctors was lower among cases as compared with controls (23\% vs 43\%; p{\textless}0.0001). On univariate analysis, the type of HCW, smoking, lack of training, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use and taking no or fewer doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be significant. On multivariate analysis, the type of HCW (risk ratio [RR] 1.67 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} 1.34 to 2.08], p{\textless}0.0001), inappropriate PPE use (RR 0.63 [95\% CI 0.44 to 0.89], p=0.01) and taking fewer doses of HCQ (RR 0.92 [95\% CI 0.86 to 0.99], p=0.03) were significant., CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 16\% among HCWs. Being a sanitation worker, inappropriate PPE use and lack of HCQ prophylaxis predisposed HCWs to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Contextually, an anamnestic questionnaire was administered. The binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of seroconversion., RESULTS: Forty-nine subjects (14.4 \%) were found positive, without significant differences between gender and age groups. The predictors identified inside the variable categories "symptoms," "risk factors" (smoking habit and established pathologies), and "professions" were the loss of taste and smell (OR, 8.563), cardiovascular diseases (OR, 2.912), and policeman profession (OR, 3.875), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Although the limited number of subjects recruited in this study, our results could give important findings to be considered for planning preventive strategies in the view of the next COVID-19 waves.},

Linked electronic health records were interrogated on a cohort of participants (age {\textgreater}=18 years), reported with HPB conditions between 1 April 2008 and 6 March 2020., PARTICIPANTS: EL-PaC-Epidem Study participants, alive on 12 February 2020, and living in East London within the previous 6 months (n=15 440). The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7\% belonging to the non-White background., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 incidence and mortality., RESULTS: Some 226 (1.5\%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95\% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62\%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age {\textgreater}70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19)., CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic records were queried (02/26-07/14/2020) to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95\% CI 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95\% CI 0.74-0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care workers (HCWs) at the frontline have been largely exposed to infected patients, running a high risk of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Since limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care setting is crucial to avoid the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, we want to share our experience as an early hit hospital where standard infection control practices have been conscientiously applied and effective. We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection., METHODS: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression., RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33\% (9.72-13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable., CONCLUSIONS: Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing.

The aims of this multicenter retrospective cohort study were to disentangle the association of BMI and associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking) in critically ill patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted in intensive care for COVID-19, in 21 centers (Europe, Israel, USA) between 02/19/2020 and 05/19/2020. Primary and secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and 28-day mortality., RESULTS: A total of 1,461 patients were enrolled, median(IQR) age was 64 years (40.9-72.0); 73.2\% males; BMI 28.1 kg/m2 (25.4-32.3); 1,080 patients (73.9\%) required IMV; the 28-day mortality estimate was 36.1\% (95\%CI, 33.0-39.5). Adjusted mixed logistic regression model showed a significant linear relation between BMI and IMV: OR 1.27 (95\%CI, 1.12-1.45) per 5 kg/m2 . Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant association between BMI and mortality, which was only increased in obesity class III ({\textgreater}=40 kg/m2 ) (HR 1.68 (95\%CI 1.06-2.64)., CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, we observed a linear association between BMI and the need for IMV, independent of other metabolic risk factors, and a non-linear association between BMI and mortality risk.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of risk of venous thromboembolism with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: A total of 1030 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected, with baseline data on demographics, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and VTE risk assessment models (RAMs), including Padua prediction score (PPS), International Medical Prevention Registry (IMPROVE), and Caprini., RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality increased progressively from 2\% in patients at low VTE risk to 63\% in those at high risk defined by PPS. Similar findings were observed in IMPROVE and Caprini scores. Progressive increases in VTE risk were also associated with higher SOFA score. High risk of VTE was independently associated with mortality regardless of adjusted gender, smoking status and some comorbidities, with hazard ratios of 29.19, 37.37 and 20.60 for PPS, IMPROVE and Caprini RAM, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for all comparisons). The predictive accuracy of PPS (area under curve (AUC) 0.900), IMPROVE (AUC 0.917), or Caprini (AUC 0.861) RAM for risk of hospitalized mortality was unexpectedly strong., CONCLUSIONS: We established that the presence of a high risk of VTE identifies a group of COVID-19 patients at higher risk for mortality. Furthermore, there is a high accuracy of VTE RAMs to predict mortality in these patients. Copyright {\textless}c2{\textgreater}{\textless}a9{\textgreater} 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relationship between current cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dual use, exclusive use and COVID-19-related measures are still unclear. This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK)., METHODS: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20-63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns., RESULTS: Across all four cohorts, 12.6\% and 4.9\% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3\% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p {\textless} 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15; CI [1.15-4.05]). Compliance of social distancing behaviors were the lowest for current dual users (aOR = 0.58; CI [0.41-0.83]) and exclusive cigarette users (aOR = 0.72; CI [0.63-0.92])., CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight dual users' higher prevalence of having COVID-19 symptoms, infection and incompliance of social distancing behaviors. Self-reported infection was associated with dual product use; dual users and exclusive cigarette users were linked to poor adherence to social distancing behaviors. Smoking cessation support and further monitoring on multiple tobacco use among these populations should be reinforced as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.},

There is a paucity of data from South East Asian Region related to the predictors of clinical outcomes in these patients. This formed the basis of conducting our study., METHODS: This was an analytical cross-sectional study. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of 125 patients was collected on admission. The study outcome was death or discharge after recovery. For univariate analysis, unpaired t-test, Chi-square and Fisher's Exact test were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and few laboratory parameters. Logistic regression was applied for multivariate analysis., RESULTS: Elderly age, ischemic heart disease and smoking were significantly associated with mortality. Elevated levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced lymphocyte counts were the predictors of mortality. The ROCs for SOFA score curve showed a cut-off value {\textgreater}= 3.5 (sensitivity- 91.7\% and specificity- 87.5\%), for IL-6 the cut-off value was {\textgreater}= 37.9 (sensitivity- 96\% and specificity- 78\%) and for lymphocyte counts, a cut off was calculated to be less than and equal to 1.46 x 109per litre (sensitivity-75.2\%and specificity- 83.3\%)., CONCLUSION: Old age, smoking history, ischemic heart disease and laboratory parameters including elevated D-dimer, raised LDH and low lymphocyte counts at baseline are associated with COVID-19 mortality. A higher SOFA score at admission is a poor prognosticator in COVID-19 patients.},

This study examined the association between living arrangements (house occupancy numbers) and outcomes in COVID-19., METHODS: Study population was drawn from the COPE Study, a multicentre cohort study. House occupancy was defined as: living alone; living with one other person; living with multiple other people; or living in a nursing/residential home. Outcomes were time from admission to mortality and discharge (Cox regression), and Day-28 mortality (logistic regression), analyses were adjusted for key comorbidities and covariates including admission: age; sex, smoking; heart failure; admission CRP; COPD; eGFR, frailty and others., RESULTS: 1584 patients were included from 13 hospitals across UK and Italy: 676 (42.7\%) were female, 907 (57.3\%) were male, median age was 74 years (range: 19-101). At 28 days, 502 (31.7\%) had died. Median admission CRP was 67, 82, 79.5 and 83mg/L for those living alone, with someone else, in a house of multiple occupancy and in a nursing/residential home, respectively. Compared to living alone, living with anyone was associated with increased mortality: within a couple (aHR 1.39, 95\%CI 1.09-1.77, p = 0.007); living in a house of multiple occupancy (aHR=1.67, 95\%CI 1.17-2.38, p = 0.005); and living in a residential home (aHR=1.36, 95\%CI 1.03-1.80, p = 0.031)., CONCLUSION: For patients hospitalised with COVID-19, those living with one or more people had an increased association with mortality, they also exhibited higher CRP indicating increased disease severity suggesting they delayed seeking care.

We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19., Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged {\textgreater}=18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with {\textgreater}1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes., Findings: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95\% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for {\textgreater}=80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81])., Interpretation: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19., Funding: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

Uni-multivariable analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors of COVID-19 survival; propensity score matching was used to estimate the impact of cancer., RESULTS: Of 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 46 had active cancer (8\%). Comorbidities included diabetes (n = 137, 25\%), hypertension (n = 284, 51\%), coronary artery disease (n = 114, 20\%) and dyslipidaemia (n = 122, 22\%). Oncologic patients were older (mean age 71 vs 65, p = 0.012), more often smokers (20\% vs 8\%, p = 0.009), with higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (13.3 vs 8.2, p = 0.046). Fatality rate was 50\% (CI 95\%: 34.9;65.1) in cancer patients and 20.2\% (CI 95\%: 16.8;23.9) in the non-oncologic population. Multivariable analysis showed active cancer (HRactive: 2.26, p = 0.001), age (HRage{\textgreater}65years: 1.08, p {\textless} 0.001), as well as lactate dehydrogenase (HRLDH{\textgreater}248mU/mL: 2.42, p = 0.007), PaO2/FiO2 (HRcontinuous: 1.00, p {\textless} 0.001), procalcitonin (HRPCT{\textgreater}0.5ng/mL: 2.21, p {\textless} 0.001), coronary artery disease (HRyes: 1.67, p = 0.010), cigarette smoking (HRyes: 1.65, p = 0.041) to be independent statistically significant predictors of outcome. Propensity score matching showed a 1.92x risk of death in active cancer patients compared to non-oncologic patients (p = 0.013), adjusted for ICU-related bias. We observed a median OS of 14 days for cancer patients vs 35 days for other patients., CONCLUSION: A near-doubled death rate between cancer and non-cancer COVID-19 patients was reported.

Our goal is to investigate the prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19 severity in individuals with different substance use and explore whether specific types of substance are potentially associated with more clinical risk factors which could increase morbimortality in this population. The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5\%), arterial hypertension (26.6\%), respiratory problems (23.4\%), and history of homelessness (25.1\%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28\% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic.

This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naive seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0\% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5\% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4\% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1\% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity.},

A total of 2401 patients were admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 11th, 2020, to May 31st, 2020. Ninety-two out of a total of 112 cancer patients were included in this study based on the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria. The clinical, demographic, and laboratory features and treatments provided were studied, and their effect on mortality rates was analyzed. In our study the median age of the patients was 67 years, and 55.4\% were male. More than half (56.5\%) of our patients had metastasis. The mortality rate was 6.2\% in the overall population with COVID-19, whereas it was 23.9\% in patients with cancer. The mortality rate in patients with metastasis was statistically significantly higher compared with those without metastasis (34.0\% vs. 10.3\% P = 0.008). The mortality rate in patients still smoking was statistically significantly higher than in non-smokers (37.5\% vs. 12.5\% P = 0.033). The mortality rates of patients with high average C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer levels were statistically significantly higher than in those without, and the mortality rates of patients with lower average albumin and hemoglobin levels were statistically significantly higher than those without (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.006, P = 0.041, P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.001, and P = 0.028, respectively). Having metastases concurrent with COVID-19 was a statistically significant factor predictive of prognosis. Also, high CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer, and low albumin and hemoglobin were related to increased mortality rates. The predictive and prognostic role of possible factors related to prognosis is still unknown and further large, multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Background: Various observations have suggested that the course of COVID-19 might be less favourable in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases receiving rituximab compared with those not receiving rituximab. We aimed to investigate whether treatment with rituximab is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases., Methods: In this cohort study, we analysed data from the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, which included patients aged 18 years or older with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with rituximab (rituximab group) compared with patients who did not receive rituximab (no rituximab group). Severe disease was defined as that requiring admission to an intensive care unit or leading to death. Secondary objectives were to analyse deaths and duration of hospital stay. The inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score method was used to adjust for potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body-mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure, and the underlying disease [rheumatoid arthritis vs others]). Odds ratios and hazard ratios and their 95\% CIs were calculated as effect size, by dividing the two population mean differences by their SD. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353609., Findings: Between April 15, 2020, and Nov 20, 2020, data were collected for 1090 patients (mean age 55.2 years [SD 16.4]); 734 (67\%) were female and 356 (33\%) were male. Of the 1090 patients, 137 (13\%) developed severe COVID-19 and 89 (8\%) died. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, severe disease was observed more frequently (effect size 3.26, 95\% CI 1.66-6.40, p=0.0006) and the duration of hospital stay was markedly longer (0.62, 0.46-0.85, p=0.0024) in the 63 patients in the rituximab group than in the 1027 patients in the no rituximab group. 13 (21\%) of 63 patients in the rituximab group died compared with 76 (7\%) of 1027 patients in the no rituximab group, but the adjusted risk of death was not significantly increased in the rituximab group (effect size 1.32, 95\% CI 0.55-3.19, p=0.53)., Interpretation: Rituximab therapy is associated with more severe COVID-19.

	abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: The reports of neurological symptoms are increasing in cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death., METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements., RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97\%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1\%), cough (76.1\%), fatigue (36.1\%), and shortness of breath (27.6\%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3\%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6\%; anosmia: 41.4\%; dysguesia: 100\%). They were more common among females (69.7\%) and non-smokers (66.7\%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8\%), headaches (12.6\%), and dizziness (11.9\%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2\% after 8 weeks and 97.3\% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9\%) and phantosmia (9.0\%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge. The demyelinating myelitis (n = 1) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 1) were also found during follow-up., CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms were found to be prevalent among individuals with COVID-19 disease and should not be under-estimated during the current pandemic outbreak.},

Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D's plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels {\textless} 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels {\textless} 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is a densely populated country with a substandard healthcare system and a mediocre economic framework. Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19's second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh., METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program., RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02\% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98\% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12\%) were more affected than females (39.88\%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92\%; rural = 49.08\%). Approximately 19\% of the asymptomatic and 62\% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58\%), at houses (23.93\%) and by traveling (12.88\%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33\%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09\%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01\%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33\% were isolated at home, 27.91\% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63\% were discharged without complications, and 0.03\% has died., CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications. The current investigation would be helpful to understand the clinical manifestations and socio-demographic situations during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can generate a systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed millions worldwide, presenting huge health and economic challenges worldwide. Several risk factors, such as age, co-infections, metabolic syndrome, and smoking have been associated with poor disease progression and outcomes. Alcohol drinking is a common social practice among adults, but frequent and/or excessive consumption can mitigate the anti-viral and anti-bacterial immune responses. Therefore, we investigated if patients with self-reported daily alcohol consumption (DAC) presented alteration in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We investigated 122 patients with COVID-19 (101 male and 46 females), in which 23 were patients with DAC (18 men and 5 women) and 99 were non-DAC patients (58 men and 41 women), without other infections, neoplasia, or immunodeficiencies. Although with no difference in age, patients with DAC presented an increase in severity-associated COVID-19 markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In addition, patients with DAC presented a reduction in the lymphocytes and monocytes counts. Importantly, the DAC group presented an increase in death rate in comparison with the non-DAC group. Our results demonstrated that, in our cohort, DAC enhanced COVID-19-associated inflammation, and increased the number of deaths due to COVID-19.

Participants were 468,569 men and women (56.5 +/- 8.1, 54.6\% women) residing in the United Kingdom. Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.

A rising number of atypical infections have been reported. Thus, scientists and clinicians are doing hard work to unravel scientific knowledge about this novel pandemic., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work was to highlight the oral manifestations which could be observed in mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was performed on 665 Egyptian patients who were confirmed COVID-19-positive based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. After applying the exclusion criteria, cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms were included in the study. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The 1st section included demographic data, smoking, alcohol consumption, and general health status. The 2nd section contained questions regarding the oral hygiene status of the patients, and additionally a question about the hygienic measures they took while being infected with COVID-19. The 3rd section included questions about the most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms the patients suffered from. The 4th section included questions that referred to the oral manifestations the patients complained of while being infected with COVID-19., RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were included in this survey. It was reported that 71.7\% of COVID-19 patients presented with some oral manifestations at a level of significance, with variable incidence - oral or dental pain (23\%), pain in jaw bones or joint (12.0\%), halitosis (10.5\%), ulcerations (20.4\%), and xerostomia (47.6\%). Some patients (28.3\%) showed 2 or 3 manifestations simultaneously., CONCLUSIONS: It was proven that mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with oral symptoms, and thus the significance of dental examination of patients with communicable diseases should be emphasized.},

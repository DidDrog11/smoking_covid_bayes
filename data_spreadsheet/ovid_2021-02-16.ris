N2  - OBJECTIVES: We studied time trends in seasonal influenza vaccination and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants in Switzerland, overall and in people aged >=65 years., DESIGN: Three cross-sectional surveys., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who participated in the Swiss Health Surveys 2007, 2012 and 2017. We calculated the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last 12 months, and performed multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: We included 51 582 individuals in this analysis. The median age was 49 years (IQR 25-64), and 27 518 were women (53.3%). The proportion of reporting a history of influenza vaccination overall was 31.9% (95% CI 31.4 to 32.4); and dropped from 34.5% in 2007 to 28.8% in 2017. The uptake of vaccination within the past 12 months was 16% in 2007 and similar in 2012 and 2017 (around 14%). In people with chronic disease, uptake dropped from 43.8% in 2007 to 37.1% in 2012 and to 31.6% in 2017 (p<0.001). In people aged >=65 years, uptake dropped from 47.8% in 2007 to 38.5% in 2012 to 36.2% in 2017 (p<0.001). In logistic regression, self-reported vaccination coverage decreased in the 65-75 years old (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66 between 2007 and 2012; aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03 between 2012 and 2017). Uptake was positively associated with the >=65 age group, living in French-speaking and urban areas, history of smoking, bad self-reported health status, private/semiprivate health insurance, having a medical profession and having any underlying chronic disease., CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination coverage was low in older and chronically ill persons. Significant efforts are required in preparing for the influenza season 2020/2021 to reduce the double burden of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. These efforts should include campaigns but also novel approaches using social media. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

N2  - Increased concentrations of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) are common in COVID-19 patients. However, their capacity to predict mortality, particularly the AST/ALT ratio, commonly referred to as the De Ritis ratio, is unknown. We investigated the association between the De Ritis ratio on admission and in-hospital mortality in 105 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to three COVID-19 referral centres in Sardinia, Italy. The De Ritis ratio was significantly lower in survivors than nonsurvivors (median: 1.25; IQR: 0.91-1.64 vs 1.67; IQR: 1.38-1.97, P = .002) whilst there were no significant between-group differences in ALT and AST concentrations. In ROC curve analysis, the AUC value of the De Ritis ratio was 0.701 (95% CI 0.603-0.787, P = .0006) with sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 70%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significant association between the De Ritis ratio and mortality (logrank test P = .014). By contrast, no associations were observed between the ALT and AST concentrations and mortality (logrank test P = .83 and P = .62, respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the HR in patients with De Ritis ratios >=1.63 (upper tertile of this parameter) remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, cardiovascular disease, intensity of care, diabetes, respiratory diseases, malignancies and kidney disease (HR: 2.46, 95% CI 1.05-5.73, P = .037). Therefore, the De Ritis ratio on admission was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Larger studies are required to confirm the capacity of this parameter to independently predict mortality in this group.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures., DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China., METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan)., RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.

N1  - Update of (UOF)
N2  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency. Here, we developed and validated a practical model based on the data from a multi-center cohort in China for early identification and prediction of which patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)., METHODS: Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort., RESULTS: The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful., CONCLUSION: We established an early prediction model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission, even in community health centers. This model can be conveniently used to predict the individual risk for ICU admission of patients with COVID-19 and optimize the use of limited resources.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic. The ability to predict cardiac injury and analyze lymphocyte immunity and inflammation of cardiac damage in patients with COVID-19 is limited. We aimed to determine the risk factors and predictive markers of cardiac injury in these patients., METHODS: Data from 124 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were collected. We compared the proportion of cardiovascular disease history in moderate, severe, and critical cases. We obtained high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTn I) results from 68 patients. Patients were divided into two groups based on positive hs-cTn I result: those with cardiac injury (n = 19) and those without cardiac injury (n = 49)., RESULTS: Compared with the group with moderate disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and smoking were more common in severe and critical cases. Diabetes mellitus was most common in the critical group. Age older than 65 years, presence of chronic kidney disease, and lower blood lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors of cardiac injury. The total T- and B-lymphocyte counts and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were significantly lower in those with cardiac injury. A minimal lymphocyte percentage < 7.8% may predict cardiac injury. The interleukin (IL) 6 level in plasma was elevated in the group with cardiac injury., CONCLUSIONS: The lymphocyte percentage in blood may become a predictive marker of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. The total T and B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts decreased and the IL-6 level increased in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. This study established prognostic scoring models based on comorbidities and other clinical information for severe and critical patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: We retrospectively collected data from 51 patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 who were admitted between January 29, 2020, and February 18, 2020. The Charlson (CCI), Elixhauser (ECI), and age- and smoking-adjusted Charlson (ASCCI) and Elixhauser (ASECI) comorbidity indices were used to evaluate the patient outcomes. Results: The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) of the COVID-19 patients was 22.82 +/- 12.32 days; 19 patients (37.3%) were hospitalized for more than 24 days. Multivariate analysis identified older age (OR 1.064, P = 0.018, 95%CI 1.011-1.121) and smoking (OR 3.696, P = 0.080, 95%CI 0.856-15.955) as positive predictors of a long LOS. There were significant trends for increasing hospital LOS with increasing CCI, ASCCI, and ASECI scores (OR 57.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.687-581.399; OR 71.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.689-898.642; and OR 19.556, P = 0.001, 95%CI 3.315-115.372, respectively). The result was similar for the outcome of critical illness (OR 21.333, P = 0.001, 95%CI 3.565-127.672; OR 13.000, P = 0.009, 95%CI 1.921-87.990; OR 11.333, P = 0.008, 95%CI 1.859-69.080, respectively). Conclusions: This study established prognostic scoring models based on comorbidities and clinical information, which may help with the graded management of patients according to prognosis score and remind physicians to pay more attention to patients with high scores.

N2  - PURPOSE: The present study investigated the correlation between the nutritional status and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different nutritional status., METHODS: 429 patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from December 2019 to March 2020 were selected and divided into different groups based on Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score (0-4: the low CONUT score group; 5-12: the high CONUT score group). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the effects of CONUT score on prognosis., RESULTS: The total score of admission status of patients with higher CONUT score was higher than that of those with lower CONUT score (chi2 = 7.152, P = 0.007). The number of adverse outcomes of female was higher than that of male (chi2 = 10.253, P = 0.001). The number of adverse outcomes was higher for patients with smoking history (P = 0.004) or hypertension (chi2 = 11.240, P = 0.001) than those without. Also, the number of adverse outcomes was higher for older patients than younger ones (chi2 = 15.681, P < 0.001). Patients with adverse outcomes had lower urine red blood cell count than patients without adverse outcomes (chi2 = 5.029, P = 0.025). However, BMI, drinking history and diabetes did not show correlation with the prognosis of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). Among patients >= 61 years old, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 6.191 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 6.191, 95% CI: 1.431-26.785). Among the non-diabetic patients, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT group was 11.678 times that of the low CONUT group (OR = 11.678, 95% CI: 2.754-49.41). For the patients who had a total score of admission status < 6, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 8.216 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 8.216, 95% CI: 2.439-27.682)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with good nutritional status showed a small chance to have adverse outcomes. Gender, age, hypertension, the number of urine red blood cell count and CONUT score affected the adverse outcomes of patients.

N2  - The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in late 2019 and early 2020. The factors that influence disease severity should be of clinical concern. Existing findings on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are also controversial and need to be confirmed by further research. In addition, the effects of alcohol consumption and betel quid (BQ) chewing on COVID-19 are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the effects of smoking, drinking, BQ chewing, and underlying diseases on the severity of COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted on 91 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Yueyang, Hunan Province, China from 21 January to 8 March, 2020. Patient demographic data, and information on smoking, drinking and BQ chewing, and underlying diseases were extracted from the patient electronic medical records (EMR) and telephone interviews. The chi-square test was used to conduct a univariate analysis of the factors influencing the severity of COVID-19, and ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to the severity of COVID-19. The results showed that the rates of smoking, drinking and BQ chewing were 15.4, 26.4, and 7.1%, respectively, there was no significant relationship between these lifestyle factors and the severity of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). However, underlying diseases such as diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 7.740, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.000-60.740, P = 0.050], source of infection (OR = 0.180, 95% CI: 0.030-0.980, P = 0.049), and employment status (retired/unemployed vs. employed: OR = 29.430, 95% CI, 1.050 - 822.330, P = 0.047) were significant independent predictors of severe COVID-19 infection. These individuals should be informed of methods to increase personal protection, and doctors should prevent these individuals from developing serious diseases. It is important to pay attention to the source of infection and timely medical treatment. This study showed that the clinical classification of COVID-19 was associated with patients with diabetes, source of infection, and retired/unemployed. Therefore in the clinical practice of COVID-19 should be more concern these factors. Although no statistical significance was found in smoking, drinking alcohol, BQ chewing, and severity of COVID-19 patients, more studies have confirmed that are harmful and risk factors for underlying diseases in the population. Health authorities should formulate policies to publicize the harmful effects of smoking, drinking, and betel nut chewing and promote a healthy lifestyle.

N2  - Background: In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases to COVID-19 remains unclear. We aimed to investigate susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: We did a multicentre retrospective study of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patients with rheumatic diseases were contacted through an automated telephone-based survey to investigate their susceptibility to COVID-19. Data about COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis were collected. Families with a documented history of COVID-19 exposure, as defined by having at least one family member diagnosed with COVID-19, were followed up by medical professionals to obtain detailed information, including sex, age, smoking history, past medical history, use of medications, and information related to COVID-19., Findings: Between March 20 and March 30, 2020, 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included in the study. The overall rate of COVID-19 in patients with an autoimmune rheumatic disease in our study population was 0.43% (27 of 6228 patients). We identified 42 families in which COVID-19 was diagnosed between Dec 20, 2019, and March 20, 2020, in either patients with a rheumatic disease or in a family member residing at the same physical address during the outbreak. Within these 42 families, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 27 (63%) of 43 patients with a rheumatic disease and in 28 (34%) of 83 of their family members with no rheumatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.68 [95% CI 1.14-6.27]; p=0.023). Patients with rheumatic disease who were taking hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of COVID-19 infection than patients taking other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.01-0.94]; p=0.044). Additionally, the risk of COVID-19 was increased with age (adjusted OR 1.04 [95%CI 1.01-1.06]; p=0.0081)., Interpretation: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease might be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population., Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Tongji Hospital Clinical Research Flagship Program.

N2  - Background: In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases to COVID-19 remains unclear. We aimed to investigate susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: We did a multicentre retrospective study of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patients with rheumatic diseases were contacted through an automated telephone-based survey to investigate their susceptibility to COVID-19. Data about COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis were collected. Families with a documented history of COVID-19 exposure, as defined by having at least one family member diagnosed with COVID-19, were followed up by medical professionals to obtain detailed information, including sex, age, smoking history, past medical history, use of medications, and information related to COVID-19., Findings: Between March 20 and March 30, 2020, 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included in the study. The overall rate of COVID-19 in patients with an autoimmune rheumatic disease in our study population was 0.43% (27 of 6228 patients). We identified 42 families in which COVID-19 was diagnosed between Dec 20, 2019, and March 20, 2020, in either patients with a rheumatic disease or in a family member residing at the same physical address during the outbreak. Within these 42 families, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 27 (63%) of 43 patients with a rheumatic disease and in 28 (34%) of 83 of their family members with no rheumatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.68 [95% CI 1.14-6.27]; p=0.023). Patients with rheumatic disease who were taking hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of COVID-19 infection than patients taking other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.01-0.94]; p=0.044). Additionally, the risk of COVID-19 was increased with age (adjusted OR 1.04 [95%CI 1.01-1.06]; p=0.0081)., Interpretation: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease might be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population., Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Tongji Hospital Clinical Research Flagship Program.

N2  - BACKGROUND: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and triggered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help., METHODS: The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis., RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: OR=1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), P=0.0006). The proportion of underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease were statistically significant higher in critical/mortal patients compared to the non-critical patients (diabetes: OR=3.68, 95% CI (2.68, 5.03), P < 0.00001; hypertension: OR=2.72, 95% CI (1.60,4.64), P=0.0002; cardiovascular disease: OR=5.19, 95% CI(3.25, 8.29), P < 0.00001; respiratory disease: OR=5.15, 95% CI(2.51, 10.57), P < 0.00001). Clinical manifestations such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea were associated with the progression of disease [fever: 0R=0.56, 95% CI (0.38, 0.82), P=0.003;shortness of breath or dyspnea: 0R=4.16, 95% CI (3.13, 5.53), P < 0.00001]. Laboratory examination such as aspartate amino transferase(AST) > 40U/L, creatinine(Cr) >= 133mol/L, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I(hs-cTnI) > 28pg/mL, procalcitonin(PCT) > 0.5ng/mL, lactatede hydrogenase(LDH) > 245U/L, and D-dimer > 0.5mg/L predicted the deterioration of disease while white blood cells(WBC)<4x109/L meant a better clinical status[AST > 40U/L:OR=4.00, 95% CI (2.46, 6.52), P < 0.00001; Cr >= 133mumol/L: OR=5.30, 95% CI (2.19, 12.83), P=0.0002; hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL: OR=43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001; PCT > 0.5 ng/mL: OR=43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001;LDH > 245U/L: OR=43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001; D-dimer > 0.5mg/L: OR=43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001; WBC < 4x109/L: OR=0.30, 95% CI (0.17, 0.51), P < 0.00001]., CONCLUSION: Male, aged over 65, smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical manifestation such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea and laboratory examination such as WBC, AST, Cr, PCT, LDH, hs-cTnI and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19.

N2  - AIM: Since December 2019, new COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred and spread around the world. However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases., METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed., RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 x 109/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes., CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study aimed to develop risk scores based on clinical characteristics at presentation to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients. 641 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected from 4997 persons under investigation. We performed a retrospective review of medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation. Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death. Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes. The model was validated by splitting the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count. Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age. The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables. The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95% CI, 0.63-0.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95% CI, 0.73-0.92], p<0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset. This study identified key independent clinical variables that predicted ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19. This risk score system may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.

N2  - Comorbidities are associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This meta-analysis aimed to explore the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing smoking history. A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The languages of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. Overall 11 case series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases, were included in this study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe COVID-19 was 4.38 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 1.29-3.05). There was no publication bias as examined by the funnel plot and Egger's test (P = not significant). The heterogeneity of included studies was moderate for both COPD and ongoing smoking history on the severity of COVID-19. COPD and ongoing smoking history attribute to the worse progression and outcome of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - During the COVID-19 epidemic, our national guidelines have suggested that surgical patients should wear a mask to decrease the potential transmission of COVID-19 in the operating room, as long as the condition allows. However, so far, there is no study to discuss the influence of wearing a mask on the ventilation and blood oxygenation status in patients of spontaneous breathing with supplementary oxygen through an anesthetic facemask. This is a before-after study in the same patient, and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited, by testing the arterial blood gas parameters at key time points before and after oxygen inhalation to evaluate the effects of two different supplementary oxygen methods ('disposable medical mask + anesthetic facemask' and 'anesthetic facemask only') on the oxygenation of subjects. Our data demonstrated whether wearing a disposable medical mask or not could effectively increase the oxygen supply of the subjects compared with the basic value before oxygen inhalation; however, compared with the group without mask, the arterial oxygen partial (PaO 2) reduced significantly at each time points when subjects wearing a disposable medical mask. There was no significant difference in other parameters, and our data showed that age growth and smoking had no significant effects on the difference of PaO 2 between the groups with and without masks. This study demonstrates effective oxygen supplementation through anesthetic facemask in subjects with spontaneous breathing who is wearing a disposable medical mask, whose pulse oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen saturation can reach 100% rapidly, and this provides a theoretical basis for the management of patients with disseminated respiratory diseases to wear masks in the operating room; however, the rate and amount of PaO 2 increase are both decreased as compared to those who is not wearing a disposable medical mask during supplementary oxygenation. Whether this difference will affect the clinical outcome needs further study.

N2  - This study was to explore the performance of immune function and compositions of hospitalization cost for patients with COVID-19 as well as the application of a grey relational mathematical model (GRMM). A total of 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and chest CT examination in our hospital were collected in this study. They were divided into 2 groups: non-severe group (mild and moderate patients, n = 57 cases), and severe group (severe and critical patients, n = 43 cases) based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general clinical data, blood routine indexes, cellular immune and humoral immune function test indexes, and the composition of hospitalization costs of the two groups of patients were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the average age, proportion of males, smoking history, and the number and proportion of patients in the non-severe group were smaller than those in the severe group (P < 0.05); the severe group had significantly more shortness of breath patients than the non-severe group (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the number of white blood cells (WBC), the number and proportion of neutrophils, and the count of neutrophils/lymphocytes in the severe group increased obviously (P < 0.05), and the number of lymphocytes and the proportion of monocytes decreased dramatically (P < 0.05); the number and proportion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ in the severe group were much lower in contrast to those in the non-severe group (P < 0.05), while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was greatly higher in contrast to that of non-severe patients (P < 0.05). Compared with the non-severe group, the bed fee, laboratory test fee, diagnosis fee, and medicine fee of the severe group were increased observably (P < 0.05). The changes in hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and expenses of proprietary Chinese medicines, while the hospitalization cost of patients in the severe group was related to bed fees, laboratory fees, and examination fees. The results revealed that elderly COVID-19 patients with basic diseases were prone to develop severe disease, immune cell depletion may be one of the reasons for the development of severe patients, and the medical insurance policy greatly reduced the hospitalization costs of COVID-19 patients.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current pandemic, and studies reported that older people have higher rates of infection and more severe cases. Recently, studies have revealed the involvement of both genetic and exposure factors in the susceptibility of COVID-19. However, the correlation between them is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the correlation between genetic and exposure factors associated with COVID-19. We retrieved the information of 7362 participants with COVID-19 testing results from the UK Biobank. We identified genetic factors for COVID-19 by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary analysis. In this study, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 15 exposure factors [smoking, alcohol intake, daytime dozing, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, dementia, atmosphere NO2 concentration, socioeconomic status, education qualification, ethnicity, and income] were found to be potential risk factors of COVID-19. Then, a gene-exposure (GxE) association network was built based on the correlation among and between these genetic factors and exposure factors. rs140092351, a SNP on microRNA miR1202, not only had the most significant association with COVID-19, but also interacted with multiple exposure factors. Dementia, alcohol consumption, daytime dozing, BMI, HDL, and atmosphere NO2 concentration were among most significant GxE interactions with COVID-19 infection (P=0.001).

N2  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is known to be a protective lifestyle factor against several non-communicable diseases while its impact on infectious diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not as clear., Methods: We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associations between both objectively and subjectively measured PA collected prospectively and COVID-19 related outcomes (overall COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, outpatient COVID-19, and COVID-19 death) in the UK Biobank cohort. Subsequently, we tested causality by using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses., Results: In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) is associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.80 (0.69, 0.93) and 0.74 (0.58, 0.95), respectively. No association is found between self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and COVID-19 related outcomes. No association is found by MR analyses., Conclusions: Our results indicate a protective effect of objectively measured PA and COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient COVID-19 and overall COVID-19) independent of age, sex, measures of obesity, and smoking status. Although the MR analyses do not support a causal association, that may be due to limited power. We conclude that policies to encourage and facilitate exercise at a population level during the pandemic should be considered. Copyright © 2020 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Since December 2019, the pneumonia cases infected with 2019 novel coronavirus have appeared, posing a critical threat to global health. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to discover the different clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 to find the potential risk factors and predictors of this disease's severity, as well as to serve as a guidance for subsequent epidemic prevention and control work. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and other databases were searched to collect studies on the difference of clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and the funnel plots could be made to evaluate the publication bias. P>0.05 means no statistical significance. Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse. In terms of laboratory indicators, the decreased lymphocyte and platelet count, and the increased levels of white blood cell (WBC), D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were more prevalent in severe patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age, gender, and proportion of severe cases did not significantly impact on the outcomes of any clinical indexes that showed high degree of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, the severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by, radiologic finding, some symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, some laboratory indicators, and smoking history, especially the ex-smokers. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have complications and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc., which were the risk factors for the disease to be severer, but the chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease were not associated the severity of COVID-19 in China.

N2  - Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan and spread in China. Here we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases. We collected and analyzed the clinical data of 172 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 who were diagnosed via qRT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs during January 2020 and February 2020. The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists. The older patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis. The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID-19. Family gatherings were showed among 26.7% of patients. A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases. CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes. The lungs of severe patients are more damaged. Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis. Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 93.0%, and the mortality rate was 2.3%. Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes. The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID-19.

N2  - COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has been an ongoing pandemic, resulting in an increase in people being infected globally. Understanding the potential risk of infection for people under different respiratory system conditions is important and will help prevent disease spreading. We explored and collected five published and one unpublished single-cell respiratory system tissue transcriptome datasets, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), aging lungs (mouse origin data), lung cancers, and smoked branchial epithelium, for specifically reanalyzing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression profiles. Compared to normal people, we found that smoking and lung cancer increase the risk for COVID-19 infection due to a higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung cells. Aged lung does not show increased risk for infection. IPF patients may have a lower risk for original COVID-19 infection due to lower expression in AT2 cells but may have a higher risk for severity due to a broader expression spectrum of TMPRSS2. Further investigation and validation on these cell types are required. Nonetheless, this is the first report to predict the risk and potential severity for COVID-19 infection for people with different respiratory system conditions. Our analysis is the first systematic description and analysis to illustrate how the underlying respiratory system conditions contribute to a higher infection risk.

N2  - Hamman-Rich syndrome is a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome physiology. It carries a grave prognosis and a high early mortality rate. It is often distinguished from other similar pulmonary pathologies based on the clinical course, laboratory findings, bronchoalveolar lavage testing, and pathology report. We detail a 77-year-old lady with no prior pulmonary disease, smoking history, or occupational and environmental exposures present to the emergency department found to be in acute hypoxic respiratory failure with impressive progressive radiographic findings. The presumptive diagnosis of Hamman-Rich syndrome was made based on a combination of factors after ruling out other similar clinical entities, especially in the setting of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, with 10%-20% of severe cases and over 508 000 deaths worldwide., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients., METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected., RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from "nonsevere" toward "nonsurvived" via "severe and survived" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death., CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients. Copyright © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and the risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated acute kidney injury (AKI)., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to examine the basic data, clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Fourth Hospital from January 1st to February 1st in 2020. According to the diagnostic criteria of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), patients with AKI were included in AKI group and those without AKI were included in non-AKI group. The differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The prognostic value of AKI for COVID-19 was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression., RESULTS: A total of 394 COVID-19 patients were included, with a total mortality of 5.6%; 37 (9.4%) of them developed AKI. The mortality of patients with COVID-19 associated AKI was 18.9%. There were significant differences in age, gender, smoking history, hypertension history, malignancy history, cardiovascular disease history and cerebrovascular disease history between the two groups. In addition to the difference of serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reaction protein (CRP) in AKI group were significantly higher than those in non-AKI group [WBC (x109/L): 5.75 (4.13, 7.83) vs. 4.52 (3.35, 5.90), NEU (x109/L): 4.55 (2.81, 6.11) vs. 3.06 (2.03, 4.50), AST (U/L): 40.0 (24.5, 69.5) vs. 30.0 (23.0, 42.5), LDH (mumolxs-1xL-1): 5.21 (3.68, 7.57) vs. 4.24 (3.05, 5.53), D-dimer (mug/L): 456 (266, 2 172) vs. 290 (152, 610), PCT (mug/L): 0.33 (0.03, 1.52) vs. 0.01 (0.01, 0.11), CRP (mg/L): 53.80 (26.00, 100.90) vs. 23.60 (9.25, 51.10), all P < 0.05], while lymphocyte count (LYM) and platelet count (PLT) were decreased [LYM (x109/L): 0.68 (0.47, 1.05) vs. 0.91 (0.63, 1.25), PLT (x109/L): 142.0 (118.0, 190.0) vs. 171.0 (130.0, 2 190.0), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of AKI group was significantly higher than that of non-AKI group [18.9% (7/37) vs. 4.2% (15/357), P < 0.01]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the 30-day cumulative survival of AKI group was lower than that of non-AKI group (log-rank: P = 0.003). Cox analysis also showed that AKI increased the odds of patients with COVID-19 mortality by 3.2-fold [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.208, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.076-9.566, P = 0.037]., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AKI is higher in patients with COVID-19. Early intervention to prevent AKI in patients with COVID-19 is of great significance to improve the prognosis of patients.

N2  - Rationale: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a predominantly respiratory illness. The first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the virus to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) on the airway epithelium. Objectives: The objective was to gain insight into the expression of ACE2 in the human airway epithelium. Methods: Airway epithelia sampled by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of trachea, large airway epithelia (LAE), and small airway epithelia (SAE) of nonsmokers and smokers were analyzed for expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus infection-related genes using microarray, RNA sequencing, and 10x single-cell transcriptome analysis, with associated examination of ACE2-related microRNA. Measurements and Main Results:  1) ACE2 is expressed similarly in the trachea and LAE, with lower expression in the SAE; 2) in the SAE, ACE2 is expressed in basal, intermediate, club, mucus, and ciliated cells; 3) ACE2 is upregulated in the SAE by smoking, significantly in men; 4) levels of miR-1246 expression could play a role in ACE2 upregulation in the SAE of smokers; and 5) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelium differentiated in vitro on air-liquid interface cultures from primary airway basal stem/progenitor cells; this can be replicated using LAE and SAE immortalized basal cell lines derived from healthy nonsmokers. Conclusions: ACE2, the gene encoding the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the human airway epithelium, with variations in expression relevant to the biology of initial steps in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Viral pathogens were more commonly reported than previously estimated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. However, the real role of virus was still controversial., METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with CAP between April and December, 2009 were prospectively enrolled. A four-fold or greater increase of IgG-titres against respiratory viruses in pair sera was tested by means of hemagglutination inhibition assay or indirect immunofluorescence. Swab samples were tested by cell culture and/or nucleic amplification tests. Viral etiology was considered definitive if at least one of the above tests was positive., RESULTS: Viral etiology was established in fifty-two (34.9%) of 149 CAP patients, twenty-two (81.5%) of 27 influenza like illness patients, and none of 75 volunteer controls. Forty-seven CAP patients were infected by a single virus (24 influenza A virus, 5 influenza B, 10 parainfluenza virus type 3 [PIV-3], 2 PIV-1, 2 adenovirus, 2 human rhinovirus and 2 coronavirus OC43), five cases by two or three viruses co-infection. Fever >= 39 degreeC (66.7%), fatigue (64.6%), and purulent sputum (52.1%) was the most common symptoms in viral pneumonia patients. On multivariate analysis, myalgia was included in the model for pneumonia associated with influenza infection. In the CURB-65 model only influenza infection was found independently associated with severe disease (CURB-65 score >= 3) out of variables, including age(years), sex, current smoking status, sick contact with febrile patients, numbers of comorbidity, presence of influenza infection, presence of PIV infection, with P = 0.021, OR 7.86 (95% CI 1.37-45.04)., CONCLUSION: Respiratory virus was not a bystander, but pathogenic in pneumonia and was a common cause of CAP.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: We analyzed the electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Third Hospital of Wuhan., RESULTS: The patients' median age was 56 years, 54.1% were female, 11.4% had a history of smoking, and 10.6% had a history of drinking. All cases of COVID-19 were community-acquired. Fever (76.8%) and cough (53.3%) were the most common clinical manifestations, and circulatory system diseases were the most common comorbidities. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 61.2% of the patients, and 2.9% of the patients were asymptomatic. Computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities in most patients (72.6%) and consolidation in 30.9%. Lymphopenia (72.3%) and hypoproteinemia (71.6%) were observed in most patients. About 20% of patients had abnormal liver function. Patients with severe disease had significantly more prominent laboratory abnormalities, including an abnormal lymphocyte count and abnormal C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, and albumin levels., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of severe respiratory illnesses similar to those caused by SARS-CoV-1. Older age, chronic comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities are associated with disease severity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiac injury is associated with poor prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the risk factors for cardiac injury have not been fully studied. In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients to determine potential risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 virus infection., METHODS: We systematically searched relevant literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Europe PMC, CNKI and other databases. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0., RESULTS: We analysed 5726 confirmed cases from 17 studies. The results indicated that compared with non-cardiac-injured patients, patients with cardiac injury are older, with a greater proportion of male patients, with higher possibilities of existing comorbidities, with higher risks of clinical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer and mortality. Moreover, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and blood creatinine in patients with cardiac injury are also higher while lymphocyte counts and platelet counts decreased. However, we fortuitously found that patients with cardiac injury did not present higher clinical specificity for chest distress (P = 0.304), chest pain (P = 0.334), palpitations (P = 0.793) and smoking (P = 0.234). Similarly, the risk of concomitant arrhythmia (P = 0.103) did not increase observably either., CONCLUSION: Age, male gender and comorbidities are risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection. Such patients are susceptible to complications and usually have abnormal results of laboratory tests, leading to poor outcomes. Contrary to common cardiac diseases, cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection did not significantly induce chest distress, chest pain, palpitations or arrhythmias. Our study indicates that early prevention should be applied to COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury to reduce adverse outcomes.

We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in an immunocompetent patient with no past history of smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The only risk factor of this patient was prolonged cough. We hypothesize the mechanism underlying the pneumomediastinum is the aggressive disease pathophysiology in COVID-19 with an incresead risk of alveolar damage. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) which presents a large spectrum of manifestations with fatal outcomes in vulnerable people over 70-years-old and with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, COPD, and smoking status. Knowledge of the entry receptor is key to understand SARS-CoV-2 tropism, transmission and pathogenesis. Early evidence pointed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. Here, we provide a critical summary of the current knowledge highlighting the limitations and remaining gaps that need to be addressed to fully characterize ACE2 function in SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathogenesis. We also discuss ACE2 expression and potential role in the context of comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Finally, we discuss the potential co-receptors/attachment factors such as neuropilins, heparan sulfate and sialic acids and the putative alternative receptors, such as CD147 and GRP78.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To undertake a review and critical appraisal of published/preprint reports that offer methods of determining the effects of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, cancer, kidney issues, and high-cholesterol on COVID-19 disease severity., METHODS: A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. "Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?". The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed., FINDINGS: A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus., CONCLUSION: Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and clinical outcome among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled. The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained. ARDS was defined as an oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) <=300 mm Hg., FINDINGS: Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; p = 0.008) and high body mass index (OR, 1.327; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.046; p = 0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase level (OR, 1.010; p = 0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in a disease exacerbation group (n = 19) and a disease relief group (n = 51). High body mass index (OR, 1.285; p = 0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR, 16.13; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment., IMPLICATIONS: These study results help in the risk stratification of patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 has created universal disarray since its outbreak in 2019. Emergent measures were taken worldwide to mitigate the morbid outcomes of the pandemic. Multiple organ systems have been shown to be negatively impacted secondary to the heightened inflammatory response to the novel virus. In this report, we focus on the respiratory system. The novel virus impact on the respiratory system has been well documented, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we present a case of a patient with no risk factors for pneumothorax (smoking, underlying lung disease, prior history of pneumothorax, age, family history) who was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and developed a significant pneumothorax requiring transfer to the intensive care unit.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from smokers, non-smokers, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer. An exhaustive search of the GEO database was performed to identify eligible data on 1st June 2020. In total, 46 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3,053 samples were identified as eligible data for further analysis. All meta-analysis were performed using RStudio. Standardized mean difference was utilized to assess the effect size of a factor on the expression of targeted genes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. This study revealed that (i) cigarette smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; (ii) significant alternations in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L were observed between current smokers and former smokers, but not between former smokers and never smokers; (iii) when compared with healthy controls with identical smoking status, patients with COPD or lung cancer showed negligible changes in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. Therefore, this study implicates cigarette smoking might contribute to the development of COVID-19 by affecting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, while smoking cessation could be effective to reduce the potential risk.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the levels of health anxiety and Beck depression according to demographic variables among a sample of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, analytical study., PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Firat University and Medical Park Hosspital, Elazig, Turkey, from March to April 2020., METHODOLOGY: A total of 270 healthcare workers (100 males and 170 females) filled out health anxiety inventory (HAI), Beck depression inventory (BDI), questionnaires. Evaluations of HAI and BDI were conducted according to demographic variables ( age, gender, marital status, jop, life style, smoking habits, sistemic disease)., RESULTS: Female healthcare workers had higher HAI and BDI scores than male (p <0.001, p <0.001). Young healthcare workers had higher HAI scores than aged healthcare workers (p=0.021) Healthcare workers with more knowledge about COVID-19 had lower HAI and BDI in (p=0.021, p=0.019). There is statistical significant differences in HAI and BDI scores in marital status (p = 0.022, p=0.002). The HAI and BDI scores of participants, who had close contact, were significantly higher than those who had no contact (p = 0.009 p=0.028). There were significant correlations between the two scales (p <0.05)., CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological support should be provided to all healthcare workers and working conditions should be corrected to relieve the anxiety and worry. Key Words: COVID-19, Healthcare workers, Health anxiety, Beck depress.

N2  - Despite the pandemic, the Government of Bangladesh decided to keep the banks open to a limited extent to keep the country's economy afloat. The aim of this study is to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 among the bankers who are usually more exposed to random people that put them at great risk to be affected. A total of 248 bankers willingly answered our questionnaire consisting of DASS-21 and relevant questions. Cronbach's reliability coefficient for the DASS-21 scale ranges from 0.84 to 0.90 which advocates that DASS-21 scales are highly reliable measures for this study. Results show that among participants, 11.1% were severe to extremely stressed, 10.6% of bankers were severe to extremely anxious, and 12.1% of them were severe to extremely depressed. The study illustrated, among the Bankers whose colleagues were infected (B=2.251, 95% CI: - 1.473, 3.029), who smoking more (B= 1.505, 95% CI: 0.411, 2.599), who wake up from sleep having a bad dreams (B = 1.018, 95% CI: 0.057, 1.979), their fear of getting infected (B = 1.717, 95% CI: 0.392, 3.04), who use public transportation (B = 1.378, 95% CI: 0.430, 2.236), who misbehave with family members (B = 1.033, 95% CI: 0.071, 1.995) and who beaten children (B = 1.210, 95% CI: 0.141, 2.279) were responsible for higher stress, depression and anxiety scores respectively. Whereas, taking nutritious food (B = -0.229, 95% CI: -0.30, 1.763), doing physical exercises (B = -0.325, 95% CI: -1.158, 0.508) reduced depression, stress and anxiety scores. The authors believed that the result of the study will be beneficial for the government and its policymakers to take psychological intervention strategies and to make certain sufficient corporal settlement of the banking professionals.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Clusters of novel coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have spread to become a global pandemic imposing a significant burden on healthcare systems. The lack of an effective treatment and the emergence of varied and complicated clinical courses in certain populations have rendered treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 difficult., METHODS: Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, a public tertiary acute care center located in Tokyo, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Japan, has been admitting patients with COVID-19 since February 2020. The present, retrospective, case-series study aimed to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the study institution., RESULTS: In total, 101 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital to receive inpatient care. Eleven patients (10.9%) received ECMO, and nine patients (8.9%) died during hospitalization after COVID-19 was diagnosed. A history of smoking and obesity were most commonly encountered among patients with a complicated clinical course. Most patients who died requested to be transferred to advanced palliative care in the early course of their hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of caring for these patients demonstrated a relatively lower mortality rate and higher survival rate in those with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement than previous reports from other countries and underscored the importance of proactive, advanced care planning in the early course of hospitalization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (eg, hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients' medical history, thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative cohort of patients, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection., METHODS: We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (ie, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit, or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and noncomplicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata., RESULTS: Of the 4353 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all age >=18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (eg, males >=65 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.94, 95% CI 1.55-5.58; P=.01) as well as cognitive and neurological disorders (eg, individuals >=65 years old: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69-4.17; P<.001) are significant risk factors. Smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression as well as cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment and recovery efforts.

N2  - AIMS: To examine perceived infection risk of COVID-19 and the health and related behavior changes among people with diabetes, compared with people without diabetes, and to examine factors associated with self-reported health during the national quarantine period in China., METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media across China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness, attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the quarantine. Regression models tested associations among study variables adjusting for covariates., RESULTS: Among the 9,016 total participants (42.6% men and 57.4% women), 585 reported having diagnosed diabetes and 8,431 had no diabetes. Participants with diabetes perceived themselves to be at higher risk and were more worried about being infected with COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic individuals (p < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants with diabetes were more likely to experience food and drug shortages and to increase their physical activity, compared to their counterparts. Among diabetic respondents, a high proportion of current smokers (74.1%) and drinkers (68.5%) reported increased amounts of smoking and drinking. People with diabetes were 11% less likely to report excellent or very good health. Having 150 min/week physical activity was positively associated with excellent or very good health (prevalence ratio, PR = 1.14, 95%CI 1.11-1.16)., CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of people with diabetes perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and increased their smoking and drinking during the pandemic.

N2  - Background: Despite an increase in the familiarity of the medical community with the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is presently a lack of rapid and effective risk stratification indicators to predict the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19 especially in severe patients. Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 117 cases confirmed with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were collected and analyzed during admission. The Multi-lobular infiltration, hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension and Age (MuLBSTA) Score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score were used to assess the death and intensive care unit (ICU) risks in all patients. Results: Among of all 117 hospitalized patients, 21 (17.9%) patients were admitted to the ICU care, and 5 (4.3%) patients were died. The median hospital stay was 12 (10-15) days. There were 18 patients with MuLBSTA score >= 12 points and were all of severe type. In severe type, ICU care and death patients, the proportion with MuLBSTA >= 12 points were greater than that of CURB65 score >= 3 points (severe type patients, 50 vs. 27.8%; ICU care, 61.9 vs. 19.0%; death, 100 vs. 40%). For the MuLBSTA score, the ROC curve showed good efficiency of diagnosis death (area under the curve [AUC], 0.956; cutoff value, 12; specificity, 89.5%; sensitivity, 100%) and ICU care (AUC, 0.875; cutoff value, 11; specificity, 91.7%; sensitivity, 71.4%). The K-M survival analysis showed that patients with MuLBSTA score >= 12 had higher risk of ICU (log-rank, P = 0.001) and high risk of death (log-rank, P = 0.000). Conclusions: The MuLBSTA score is valuable for risk stratification and could effectively screen high-risk patients at admission. The higher score at admission have higher risk of ICU care and death in patients infected with COVID. Copyright © 2020 Xu, Hou, Zhang, Xu, Zhang, Fu, Xie, Sun, Wen, Liu, Yang, Yang and Guo.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), build an early warning model for severe/critical type, and aim at providing reference for the prediction of severe/critical COVID-19., METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated in the Second People' Hospital of Fuyang City from January 20th to February 18th in 2020 were retrospective analyzed, including the demographic and epidemiological date, vital signs and hematology indexes, etc. on admission. Patients were divided into the normal type (set as normal group) and severe/critical type (set as severe group) according to the COVID-19 treatment plan classification standard published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The differences between two groups were compared, and the variables with statistical significance were incorporated in the multivariate binary unconditional Logistic regression analysis to screen the risk factors of severe/critical type. Risk factors were summarized to establish an early warning model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out to evaluate the significance of the early warning model in the screening of critically COVID-19., RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with COVID-19 were admitted, including 125 patients of normal type and 30 patients of severe/critical type. (1) Compared with normal group, patients in severe group were older, and with higher proportion of basic diseases, higher body mass index (BMI), higher incidence of tachypnea, persistent high fever, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 0.95, while the white blood cell count (WBC), CD4+T lymphocyte, CD8+T lymphocyte, lymphocyte count (LYM) were decreased obviously, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid a protein (SAA), and CT showed higher incidence of multi-pulmonary lobe lesions. There were no significant differences of gender, travel history from Wuhan, smoking history, shock index (SI) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the two groups. (2) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age >= 60 years old [odds ratio (OR) = 1.620, P = 0.031], combined with underlying diseases (OR = 1.521, P = 0.044), persistent high fever (OR = 2.469, P = 0.014), WBC < 2.0x109/L and/or LYM < 0.4x109/L (OR = 3.079, P = 0.006), pulmonary multilobar lesions (OR = 1.367, P = 0.047), and IL-6 >= 30 ng/L (OR = 2.426, P = 0.010) were the risk factors of severe/critical COVID-19. (3) The OR value corresponding to each risk factors were scored by rounding. Two points were scored for age >= 60 years old, with underlying diseases, persistent high fever and IL-6 >= 30 ng/L, 3 points for WBC < 2.0x109/L and/or LYM < 0.4x109/L, 1 point for pulmonary multilobar lesions, and totally calculated as early warning model scores. The early warning model score of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the normal group (9.33+/-2.79 vs. 5.04+/-2.38, t = 9.010, P = 0.001). (4) The ROC curve analysis showed the area under ROC curve (AUC) of early warning model on the early screening of severe/critical patients in COVID-19 was 0.944, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.903-0.985; and the sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 72.0% respectively while the cut-off was 6.5., CONCLUSIONS: There are many differences between severe/critical and mild COVID-19 patients. The establishment of early warning model could help to screen severe/critical patients at an early stage, with certain significance for guiding treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has made people uncertain about their perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 and COVID-19 response measures. To mount an effective response to this epidemic, it is necessary to understand the public's perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypothesis that people's perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 influence their attitudes and behaviors., METHODS: This study used an open dataset of web-based questionnaires about COVID-19. The questionnaires were provided by Nexoid United Kingdom. We selected the results of a questionnaire on COVID-19-related behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions among the US public. The questionnaire was conducted from March 29 to April 20, 2020. A total of 24,547 people who lived in the United States took part in the survey., RESULTS: In this study, the average self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 was 33.2%, and 49.9% (12,244/24,547) of the respondents thought that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were less than 30%. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 among women was 1.35 times that of males. A 5% increase in perceived infection risk was significantly associated with being 1.02 times (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02-1.02; P<.001) more likely to report having close contact with >10 people, and being 1.01 times (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01; P<.001) more likely to report that cohabitants disagreed with taking steps to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there was no significant association between participants who lived with more than 5 cohabitants or less than 5 cohabitants (P=.85). Generally, participants who lived in states with 1001-10,000 COVID-19 cases, were aged 20-40 years, were obese, smoked, drank alcohol, never used drugs, and had no underlying medical conditions were more likely to be in close contact with >10 people. Most participants (21,017/24,547, 85.6%) agreed with washing their hands and maintaining social distancing, but only 20.2% (4958/24,547) of participants often wore masks. Additionally, male participants and participants aged <20 years typically disagreed with washing their hands, maintaining social distancing, and wearing masks., CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first attempt to describe the determinants of the US public's perception of the threat of COVID-19 on a large scale. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 differed significantly based on the respondents' genders, states of residence, ages, body mass indices, smoking habits, alcohol consumption habits, drug use habits, underlying medical conditions, environments, and behaviors. These findings can be used as references by public health policy makers and health care workers who want to identify populations that need to be educated on COVID-19 prevention and health.

N2  - Objective: To report the clinical characteristics and transmission rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community inpatient long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation facility designed for persons with serious mental illness to provide insight into transmission and symptom patterns and emerging testing protocols, as well as medical complications and prognosis., Methods: This study examined a cohort of 54 residents of a long-term care psychiatric rehabilitation program from March to April 2020. Baseline demographics, clinical diagnoses, and vital signs were examined to look for statistical differences between positive versus negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) groups. During the early phase of the pandemic, the facility closely followed the local shelter-in-place order (starting March 19, 2020) and symptom-based testing., Results: Of the residents, the primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizoaffective disorder: 28 (51.9%), schizophrenia: 21 (38.9%), bipolar I disorder: 3 (5.5%), and unspecified psychotic disorder: 2 (3.7%). Forty (74%) of 54 residents tested positive for SARS-COV-2, with a doubling time of 3.9 days. There were no statistical differences between the positive SARS-COV-2 versus negative groups for age or race/ethnicity. Psychiatric and medical conditions were not significantly associated with contracting SARS-COV-2, with the exception of obesity (n = 17 [43%] positive vs n = 12 [86%] negative, P = .01). Medical monitoring of vital signs and symptoms did not lead to earlier detection. All of the residents completely recovered, with the last resident no longer showing any symptoms 24 days from the index case., Conclusion: Research is needed to determine optimal strategies for long-term care mental health settings that incorporate frequent testing and personal protective equipment use to prevent rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2. © Copyright 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic of global public health concern. We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases., RESULTS: Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease. Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer. Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases., CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung. Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding risk factors associated with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited. This study aimed to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 severity., METHODS: Overall, 690 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited between 1 January and 18 March 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang; finally, 442 patients were assessed. Data were categorised into the training and test sets to develop and validate the model, respectively., FINDINGS: A predictive HNC-LL (Hypertension, Neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte count, Lactate dehydrogenase) score was established using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The HNC-LL score accurately predicted disease severity in the Honghu training cohort (area under the curve [AUC]=0.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800-0.922; P<0.001); Honghu internal validation cohort (AUC=0.871, 95% CI: 0.769-0.972; P<0.001); and Nanchang external validation cohort (AUC=0.826, 95% CI: 0.746-0.907; P<0.001) and outperformed other models, including CURB-65 (confusion, uraemia, respiratory rate, BP, age >=65 years) score model, MuLBSTA (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hypertension, and age) score model, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio model. The clinical significance of HNC-LL in accurately predicting the risk of future development of severe COVID-19 was confirmed., INTERPRETATION: We developed an accurate tool for predicting disease severity among COVID-19 patients. This model can potentially be used to identify patients at risks of developing severe disease in the early stage and therefore guide treatment decisions., FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81972897) and Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2015).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited., METHOD: Throat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People's Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and chi2 tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant., RESULTS: Of the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41). The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM results were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively., CONCLUSION: Among the candidate blood indicators, serum IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; these indicators can be used as potential preliminary screening tools to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: New evidence from retrospective cohort studies on risk of death from COVID-19 infection became available. We aimed to systematically review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcome of COVID-19., METHODS: We performed meta-analysis, using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from December 1 2019 to June 10 2020. The meta-analysis summarized clinical, laboratory, radiological features, and complications of non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19. In addition, a fixed- or random-effects model was adopted based on the heterogeneity among studies. We also used funnel-plot with Egger's tests to screen potential publication bias., RESULTS: In total, twenty studies with 15,408 COVID-19 cases were included in our meta-analysis. Male, current smoking, and older age were associated with in-hospital death. Patients aged 60 years or over had the highest pooled ORs [OR 4.94 (2.89, 8.44)]. Non-survivors were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Respiratory disease had the highest pooled ORs [OR 2.55 (2.14, 3.05)]. Dyspnea [OR 3.31 (1.78, 6.16); I2 : 83%] and fatigue [OR 1.36 (1.07, 1.73); I2 : 0%] were associated with increased risk of death. Increased white blood cell count, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, were also associated with increased risk of death. Biomarkers of coagulation function, inflammation, liver and kidney function, cardiac and muscle injury were also elevated in nonsurvivors., CONCLUSIONS: Male, current smoking patients aged 60 years or over might face a greater risk of in-hospital death and the comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory disease, and CKD could also influence the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical feature such as dyspnea and fatigue could imply the exacerbation and even death. Our findings highlighted early markers of mortality which were beneficial to identify fatal COVID-19.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States., DESIGN: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data., DATA SOURCES: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM 2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses., RESULTS: We found that an increase of only 1 mug/m 3 in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses., CONCLUSIONS: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM 2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted specialty chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care. We examined the degree to which care has moved to remote approaches, eliciting clinician and patient perspectives on what is appropriate for ongoing remote delivery., METHODS: Using an online research platform, we conducted a survey and consensus-building process involving clinicians and patients with COPD., RESULTS: Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52, 95%), reinforce smoking cessation (n=46, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%), providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%), reinforcing smoking cessation (81%), deciding whether patients should seek in-person care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%)., CONCLUSION: Adoption of remote care delivery appears high, with many care activities partially or completely delivered remotely. Our work identifies strengths and limitations of remote care delivery. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease., AIMS: We investigated, in the UK Biobank, whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19., METHODS: 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK during 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available for 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups., RESULTS: 4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (>= 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. However, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.

N2  - AIMS: To report long-term outcomes of patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for early stage, peripherally located non-small cell lung cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value. Survival was poorer for patients who received the 50 Gy in 10 fractions schedule. Treatment was very well tolerated with very low rates of grade 3-4 toxicity (1%)., CONCLUSIONS: SABR for peripherally located, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer can be safely and effectively implemented in a non-academic institution with appropriate equipment and training. Overall survival outcomes and toxicity rates are comparable with internationally published studies. Patients treated with 50 Gy in 10 fractions had a poorer survival outcome.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly affected mortality worldwide1. There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, and this requires new approaches for the timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, we created OpenSAFELY-a secure health analytics platform that covers 40% of all patients in England and holds patient data within the existing data centre of a major vendor of primary care electronic health records. Here we used OpenSAFELY to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.53-1.65)); greater age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29-1.69) and 1.45 (1.32-1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest cohort studies on this topic so far. More patient records are rapidly being added to OpenSAFELY, we will update and extend our results regularly.

N2  - Increased expression of pulmonary ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, could contribute to increased infectivity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes, but ACE2 expression has not been studied in lung tissue of subjects with diabetes. We therefore studied ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in lung tissue samples of subjects with and without diabetes that were collected between 2002 and 2020 from patients undergoing lobectomy for lung tumors. For RT-PCR analyses, samples from 15 subjects with diabetes were compared with 91 randomly chosen control samples. For immunohistochemical staining, samples from 26 subjects with diabetes were compared with 66 randomly chosen control samples. mRNA expression of ACE2 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Protein levels of ACE2 were visualized by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples and quantified in alveolar and bronchial epithelium. Pulmonary ACE2 mRNA expression was not different between subjects with or without diabetes. In contrast, protein levels of ACE2 were significantly increased in both alveolar tissue and bronchial epithelium of patients with diabetes compared with control subjects, independent of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, BMI, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, and other potential confounders. To conclude, we show increased bronchial and alveolar ACE2 protein expression in patients with diabetes. Further research is needed to elucidate whether upregulation of ACE2 expression in airways and lungs has consequences on infectivity and clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

N2  - Prior publications on small subsets of cancer patients infected with SARS CoV-2 have shown an increased risk of mortality compared to the general population. Furthermore, patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be at particularly high risk given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardio-pulmonary comorbidities. For this reason, physicians around the world have formed TERAVOLT, a global consortium dedicated to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on patients with thoracic malignancies. Copyright © 2020.

T1  - Dual Substance Use of Electronic Cigarettes and Alcohol.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are a modern nicotine delivery system that rapidly grew in widespread use, particularly in younger populations. Given the long history of the comorbidity of alcohol and nicotine use, the rising prevalence of ECs raises the question as to their role in the consumption of alcohol. Of the numerous models of ECs available, JUUL is the most popular. This narrative review aims to determine current trends in literature regarding the relationship between EC and alcohol dual use, as well as hypothesize potential pathogenic tissue damage and summarize areas for future study, including second-hand vapor exposure and calling for standardization among studies. In summary, EC users are more likely to participate in hazardous drinking and are at higher risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We surmise the pathogenic damage of dual use may exhibit an additive effect, particularly in pathogen clearance from the lungs, increased inflammation and decreased immune response, physical damage to epithelial cells, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like illnesses. A better understanding of pathogenic damages is critical to understand the risks placed on dual users when exposed to respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

N2  - A 44-year-old male with no previous medical history or comorbidities presented with significantly increasing shortness of breath, myalgia, nausea, and fatigue. He had no diagnosed medical conditions and enjoyed good health prior to the episode of acute respiratory infection. There was no history of smoking, emphysema, or chronic lung diseases. CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities in predominantly peripheral distribution. Based on imaging spectrum and global pandemic of the novel coronavirus, typical SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection was suspected. Viral load was confirmed with biochemical data and laboratory results. Interestingly, despite intensive treatment, the patient developed sudden complications during the second week of his hospitalization. The symptoms started to resolve on pharmacological treatment and supplemental noninvasive oxygen supply over the next weeks. We illustrate and discuss the case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum as an uncommon manifestation of novel SARS-CoV2 chest infection. Even though our patient did not develop acute respiratory distress syndrome or further complications, the presented case highlights the importance of basic radiological monitoring of the disease in order to ensure prompt diagnosis of complications and appropriate subsequent management.

N2  - Objectives: To describe a case of acute limb ischemia caused by arterial thrombosis due to coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Clinical observation of a patient., Setting: Academic medical center., Patient: A 59-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior smoking., Intervention: Clinical observation and data extraction from electronic medical records., Measurements and Main Results: We report a case of peripheral arterial thrombosis associated with coronavirus disease 2019, resulting in acute limb ischemia of the right lower extremity. This event was heralded by a sudden and significant elevation in d-dimer levels. At the time of surgery, a long, gelatinous clot was retrieved from the right popliteal artery. Perioperatively, she continued to have absent pedal Doppler signals and after multiple embolectomy attempts, required distal arterial cut down with removal of additional thrombi and resultant improvement of distal arterial flow., Conclusions: This case demonstrates the importance of regularly checking d-dimer levels and vigilant monitoring for arterial thrombotic events, as they can rapidly become catastrophic.

N2  - It seems that the medical personnel in contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at an especially high risk of adverse psychological effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the mental health factors among healthcare workers by quantifying the severity of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, while taking into account coexisting diseases. The study involved 441 healthcare professionals including 206 healthcare workers at emergency wards, infectious wards, and intensive care units. The control group consisted of 235 healthcare workers working in wards other than those where individuals from the study group worked. Regression adjusted by age, gender, the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and cigarette smoking showed the elevated risk of anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (OR = 1.934; p < 0.001), depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale (OR = 2.623; p < 0.001), and sleep disorders on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale (OR = 3.078; p < 0.001). Our study showed that healthcare workers who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients at emergency wards, infectious wards, and intensive care units are at a much higher risk of showing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders than healthcare workers working in other wards.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic outbreak with a high mortality. Prognostic factors of critically ill patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated yet., Methods: In the present study, 59 patients with COVID-19 from the intensive care unit of the Caidian Branch of Tongji Hospital were enrolled. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data, and clinical outcomes were collected. Prognostic factors were statistically defined., Results: Of the 59 patients studied (67.4+/-11.3 years), 38 patients were male, 51 had underlying diseases, and 41 patients died during admission. Compared with the survivors, the deceased patients were of older age, had more smoking history, severer fatigue, and diarrhea, a higher incidence of multiple organ injuries, more deteriorative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, remarkably impaired cellular immune response, and strengthened cytokine release. Age higher than 70 (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.45-5.23), arrhythmia (OR=4.76, 95% CI=1.59-14.25), and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score above 4 (OR=5.16, 95% CI=1.29-20.55) were identified as risk factors for mortality of patients., Conclusion: Critically ill COVID-19 patients aged higher than 70, arrhythmia, or a SOFA score above 4 have a high risk of mortality, and need prior medical intervention.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess association of clinical features on COVID-19 patient outcomes., DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic medical record data., SETTING: Five member hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC)., PARTICIPANTS: 28 336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 24 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, including 6158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Positive test rates and in-hospital mortality were assessed for different racial groups. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities., RESULTS: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p<0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray's T=248.9; p<0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation., CONCLUSIONS: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. In addition, we identified key clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk of a severe infection response and predict survival. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China., METHOD: In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological findings of patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020., RESULTS: Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16)., CONCLUSION: In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.

N2  - Electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping is increasing rapidly in the United States, as e-cigs are considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes. However, limited research has been conducted to understand the possible mechanism that mediate, toxicity and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs. We hypothesized that sub-chronic e-cig exposure induces inflammatory response and dysregulated repair/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which occur through the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR alpha7). Adult wild-type (WT), nAChRalpha7 knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChRalpha7 CreCC10) mice were exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lungs tissues were collected to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased the inflammatory cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased ACE2 Covid-19 receptor, whereas nAChR alpha7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP2, MMP8, and MMP9 were altered both at the protein and mRNA transcript levels in female and male, but WT mice exposed to PG alone showed a sex-dependent phenotype. Moreover, MMP12 was increased significantly in male mice exposed to PG with or without nicotine in a nAChR alpha7-dependent manner. Additionally, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine altered the abundance of ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin significantly in a sex-dependent manner, but without the direct role of nAChR alpha7 gene. Overall, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine affected lung inflammation and repair responses/ECM remodeling, which were mediated by nAChR alpha7 in a sex-dependent manner.

T1  - The role of high cholesterol in age-related COVID19 lethality.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan China in 2019. The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Understanding these differences is critical for safeguarding the vulnerable and guiding effective policy and treatments. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the endocytic entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol showed almost twice the total number of viral entry points. The cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the viral entry site where SARS-CoV-2 docks to properly exploit entry into the cell. Cholesterol also increased binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains. In mouse lung we found age and high fat diet induced cholesterol loading into lung tissue by up to 40%. Based on these findings, we propose a cholesterol dependent model for COVID19 lethality in elderly and the chronically ill. As cholesterol increases with age and inflammation (e.g. obesity, smoking, and diabetes), the cell surface is coated with viral entry points, optimally assembled viral entry proteins, and optimal furin priming. Importantly our model suggests problems arise when cholesterol levels are high in the tissue, not the blood. In fact, rapidly dropping cholesterol in the blood may indicate severe loading of cholesterol in peripheral tissue and a dangerous situation for escalated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Molecules that remove cholesterol from tissue or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization for priming in the producer cells, likely reduce the severity of COVID19 in critically ill patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting people's psychosocial health and well-being through various complex pathways. The present study aims to investigate the perceived psychosocial health and its sociodemographic correlates among Chinese community-dwelling residents., METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98 years from eight provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis., RESULTS: Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and positively associated with drinking (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.04-2.02). Compared with those in the lowest income bracket ( CNY 40 000) had the lowest odds of reporting perceived hopelessness (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.48). Smoking also showed negative association with depression only among men (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of the participants reported worsening in the experience of hopelessness and loneliness, with more than two-fifth of worsening depression during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak. Several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors were found to be associated with the outcome variables, most notably participants' marital status, household income, smoking, alcohol drinking, existing chronic conditions. These findings may be of significance to treat patients and help them recover from the pandemic.

N2  - An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4%-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase ACE2 mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The current recommendation for reducing person-to-person Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission is social distancing, including remote work and school, and home confinement. However, confinement may cause negative feelings, such as frustration, anger, boredom, and stress, in quarantined people. Furthermore, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity behaviors are commonly linked to home confinement, leading to weight gain, metabolic disorders, smoking, and exacerbated alcohol consumption. As a result, these unhealthy behaviors are typically linked to vascular endothelium damage (endothelial dysfunction), which is a first step for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given that CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, attenuating the progression of endothelial dysfunction is very important for the control of CVD. Consuming vegetable rich in nitrate, such as beetroots, may be an effective way to prevent endothelial dysfunction. Several emerging studies have recommended beetroot juice in order to improve endothelial function in hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic individuals, as well as in those with CVD risk factors. Therefore, nitrate-rich vegetable consumption, such as beetroot, should be encouraged to be included in the diet during confinement from COVID-19 outbreaks in order to alleviate the potential negative effect of home confinement on cardiovascular health.

T1  - Smoking and COVID-19: Similar bronchial ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and higher TMPRSS4 expression in current versus never smokers.
A1  - Voinsky, Irena

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Uncertainties remain concerning the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Among unsettled controversies is whether tobacco smoking increases or protects from severe COVID-19. Several epidemiological studies reported reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among smokers, while other studies reported the opposite trend. Some authors assumed that smokers have elevated airway expression of ACE2, the cell recognition site of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, but this suggestion remains unverified. We therefore performed data mining of two independent NCBI GEO genome-wide RNA expression files (GSE7894 and GSE994) and report that in both data sets, current smokers and never smokers have, on average, closely similar bronchial epithelial cell mRNA levels of ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2, coding for a serine protease priming SARS-Cov-2 for cell entry, and ADAM17, coding for a protease implicated in ACE2 membrane shedding. In contrast, the expression levels of TMPRSS4, coding for a protease that primes SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry similarly to TMPRSS2, were elevated in bronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with never smokers, suggesting that higher bronchial TMPRSS4 levels in smokers might put them at higher SARS-Cov-2 infection risk. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 severity need clarification with larger studies. Additionally, the postulated protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide, which may presumably reduce the risk of a "cytokine storm" in infected individuals, deserve assessment by controlled clinical trials.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant pressure on health and social care. Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19., METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease., RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58-81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6-24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty (>= CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1-3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97-4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94-7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09-7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12-4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06-9.56)., CONCLUSIONS: Around a quarter of patients admitted with COVID-19 had increased care needs at discharge. Pre-admission frailty was strongly associated with the need for an increased level of care at discharge. Our results have implications for service planning and public health policy as well as a person's functional outcome, suggesting that frailty screening should be utilised for predictive modelling and early individualised discharge planning.

N2  - : E-cigarette or vaping, product associated lung injury is a rampant public health issue with a total of 2807 reported hospitalized patients in the United States as of February 18, 2020. Limited data, non-specific symptoms, non-responsiveness to antibiotics, and the lack of a specific biomarker, make it a diagnosis of exclusion. Overlap of clinical and imaging findings with other ongoing respiratory illness (MERS, SARS and CoVid-19) poses a challenge in accurate diagnosis. We compiled 3 cases of patients hospitalized with confirmed vaping-associated lung injury and analyzed their imaging patterns, which revealed bilateral consolidation, ground-glass opacities and pleural effusions. We also reviewed the available literature on pathophysiology, imaging findings of EVALI and other respiratory illness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible relationships between pre-existing medical conditions (including common comorbidities and chronic medications) and risk for suffering COVID-19 disease in middle-aged and older adults., DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Twelve primary care centres (PCCs) in Tarragona (Spain)., PARTICIPANTS: 79 083 people (77 676 community-dwelling and 1407 nursing-home residents), who were all individuals aged >50 years affiliated to the 12 participating PCCs., OUTCOMES: Baseline cohort characteristics (age, sex, vaccinations, comorbidities and chronic medications) were established at study start (1st. March 2020) and primary outcome was time to COVID-19 confirmed by PCR among cohort members throughout the epidemic period (from 1st. March 2020 to 23rd. May 2020). Risk for suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable HRs adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and medications use., RESULTS: During the study period, 2324 cohort members were PCR-tested, with 1944 negative and 380 positive results, which means an incidence of 480.5 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 persons-period. Assessing the total study cohort, only age (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p=0.002), nursing-home residence (HR 21.83; 95% CI 16.66 to 28.61; p<0.001) and receiving diuretics (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.76; p=0.026) appeared independently associated with increased risk. Smoking (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; p=0.022), ACE inhibitors (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.046) and antihistamine (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01; p=0.052) were associated with a lower risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, cancer (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.24; p=0.035), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.07; p=0.025) and cardiac disease (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.19; p=0.021) emerged to be also associated with an increased risk. Receiving ACE inhibitors (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.99; p=0.046) and influenza vaccination (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; p=0.012) was associated with decreased risk., CONCLUSION: Age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID-19. Conversely, receiving ACE inhibitors, antihistamine and influenza vaccination could be protective, which should be closely investigated in further studies specifically focused on these concerns.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Population-based data on the current Covid-19 pandemic is scarce. This study investigated incidence and risk to suffer Covid-19 by baseline underlying conditions in people >=50 years in Tarragona region across march-april 2020., METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study involving 79,071 adults >=50 years-old in Tarragona region (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Cohort characteristics (age, sex, residence, vaccinations history and comorbidities) were established at baseline, and Covid-19 cases occurring between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 were registered. Cox regression analysis calculating Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to estimate risk for Covid-19., RESULTS: Across study period, 1,547 cohort members were PCR tested (22.6% positive) and 367 were presumptive cases without PCR tested. Considering PCR-confirmed Covid-19, incidence (per 100,000 persons-period) was 441 overall (248, 141, 424, 1,303 and 3,135 in 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and >=90 years-old, respectively; 380 in men and 497 in women; 259 in community-dwelling and 10,571 in nursing-home). By comorbidities, maximum incidence emerged among persons with neurological disease (2,723), atrial fibrillation (1,348), chronic renal failure (1,050), cardiac disease (856), respiratory disease (798) and diabetes (706). Lower incidence appeared in rheumatic diseases (230) and smokers (180). In multivariable analysis focused on community-dwelling individuals (N=77,671), only cardiac disease (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p=0.045) and respiratory disease (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00-3.02; p=0.051) were associated with an increased risk, whereas smoking (HR:0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74; p=0.002) and influenza vaccinated (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; p=0.015) appeared associated with a decreased risk., CONCLUSIONS: Apart of increasing age and nursing-home residence, chronic respiratory and cardiac disease appear at increased risk for suffering covid19. This study investigated population-based incidence of Covid-19 infection by underlying conditions among adults >=50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) across two first months pandemic period.

N2  - Background: Clinical indications for medicinal cannabis include chronic conditions; thus users (MCUs) are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). The study aimed to provide data on cannabis use and self-reported behavioral changes among MCUs with preexisting chronic conditions in response to the pandemic. Methods: An internet-based questionnaire was administered to adults >=18 who self-reported medicinal cannabis use within the past year. Data are from respondents between March 21 and April 23, 2020; response rate was 83.3%. Health conditions and cannabis frequency, route, and patterns of use were assessed via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire (Vidot et al. 2020). Results: Participants (N = 1202) were predominantly non-Hispanic white (82.5%) and 52.0% male (mean age 47.2 years). Mental health (76.7%), pain (43.7%), cardiometabolic (32.9%), respiratory (16.8%), and autoimmune (12.2%) conditions were most reported. Those with mental health conditions reported increased medicinal cannabis use by 91% since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic compared to those with no mental health conditions (adjusted odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.38-2.65). 6.8% reported suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Two percent (2.1%) have been tested for COVID-19 with only 1 positive test result. Some MCUs (16%) changed their route of cannabis administration, switching to nonsmoking forms. Conclusions: The majority of MCUs reported at least one preexisting chronic health condition. Over half report fear of COVID-19 diagnosis and giving the virus to someone else; yet only some switched from smoking to nonsmoking forms of cannabis. Clinicians may consider asking about cannabis use among their patients, particularly those with chronic health conditions.

T1  - Scientific Rationale for a Bottom-Up Approach to Target the Host Response in Order to Try and Reduce the Numbers Presenting With Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome Associated With COVID-19. Is There a Role for Statins and COX-2 Inhibitors in the Prevention and Early Treatment of the Disease?.
A1  - Verrall, Geoffrey Mark
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The inflammatory response to and the subsequent development of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is considered to underpin COVID-19 pathogenesis. With a developing world catastrophe, we need to examine our known therapeutic stocks, to assess suitability for prevention and/or treatment of this pro-inflammatory virus. Analyzing commonly available and inexpensive immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory medications to assess their possible effectiveness in improving the host response to COVID-19, this paper recommends the following: (1) optimize current health-cease (reduce) smoking, ensure adequate hypertension and diabetes control, continue exercising; (2) start on an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor "statin" for its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce the mortality associated with ARDS; and (3) consider using Diclofenac (or other COX-2 inhibition medications) for its anti-inflammatory and virus toxicity properties. For purposes of effectiveness, this needs to be in the early course of the disease (post infection and/or symptom presentation) and given in a high dose. The downsides to these recommended interventions are considered manageable at this stage of the pandemic. Copyright © 2020 Verrall.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. The application of preventive measures has proven to be the best strategy to minimize the number of patients and the dissemination of and deaths from COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors that limit the adherence of asthmatic patients to measures that prevent COVID-19 among residents of a region with a high risk of a COVID-19 outbreak., METHODS: Through a cross-sectional study, data from 2,372 participants aged 16-24 years were analyzed. To collect their information, a questionnaire was constructed using the Google Forms tool. Due to the prevention measures in place for COVID-19, the home quarantine of many people, and the lack of socialization, the questionnaire was distributed through email (Internet) and WhatsApp. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the variables., RESULTS: The prevalence of asthma was 12.2%, and non-adherence to the guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 was 53.1%. Approximately 30.8% of asthma patients did not comply with the basic prevention measures for COVID-19. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that being male, active smoking, and believing that COVID-19 is not a more severe disease for people suffering from asthma than others were associated with non-adherence to the basic protection measures established in the guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: It is important for health professionals to advise asthma patients to comply with the basic measures of protection against COVID-19 and timely use medications for asthma control.

A1  - Varga, Zsuzsanna
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - COVID-19 disease is a systemic inflammatory viral reaction starting with the viral phase followed by the inflammatory phase. The first phase is rather mild and asymptomatic with only a small subset of infected patients turning into the inflammatory phase with high mortality. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors pose a considerably higher risk to develop severe or lethal COVID-19 disease course. COVID-19 affects not only the epithelial cells of the lung parenchyma via ACE2, but also endothelial cells across the whole body thus leading to generalized endothelial damage and inflammation, so-called endotheliitis. The histological morphology of endotheliitis comprises the accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages beneath the endothelial cells and within the perivascular spaces. Endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Endotheliitis thus can shift the vascular equilibrium towards more pronounced vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischemia, inflammation with associated tissue edema and a procoagulant state. Patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction (male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease) are particularly vulnerable and have adverse outcomes in COVID-19. This is a rationale for approaches to stabilize the endothelium. Most of these findings have been established from autopsies since the outbreak of the pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has led to measures of social distancing and quarantine worldwide. This stressful period may lead to psychological problems, including increases in substance use., OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis consumption before and during COVID-19 lockdown and motives for these changes in substance use., METHOD: A web-based survey was filled out by an unselected population during the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium that assessed changes in alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis consumption in the period before and during the COVID-19 lockdown and also asked about reasons for change., RESULTS: A total of 3,632 respondents (mean age 42.1 +/- 14.6 years; 70% female) filled out the survey. Overall, respondents reported consuming more alcohol (d = 0.21) and smoking more cigarettes (d = 0.13) than before the COVID-19 pandemic (both p < 0.001), while no significant changes in the consumption of cannabis were noted. The odds of consuming more alcohol during the lockdown were associated with younger age (OR = 0.981, p < 0.001), more children at home (OR = 1.220, p < 0.001), non-healthcare workers (p < 0.001), and being technically unemployed related to COVID-19 (p = 0.037). The odds of smoking more cigarettes during the lockdown were associated with younger age (OR = 0.988, p = 0.027), current living situation (p < 0.001), lower education (p = 0.015), and working situation related to COVID-19 (p = 0.018). Boredom, lack of social contacts, loss of daily structure, reward after a hard-working day, loneliness, and conviviality were the main reasons for consuming more of the various substances., CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, individuals consumed slightly more alcohol and smoked marginally more cigarettes compared to the period before the lockdown. Further research focussing on follow-up of individuals at risk may be useful to provide appropriate care in post-COVID times. Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Respiratory infections in infancy may protect against developing Th2-mediated allergic disease (hygiene hypothesis). To estimate the relative contribution of particular viruses to the development of the immune system and allergic disease, we investigated longitudinally the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants. One hundred and twenty-six healthy infants were included in this prospective birth cohort study in their first year of life. Physical examination was performed and nasal brush samples were taken during routine visits every 6 months and during an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (sick visits). The prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants with URTI, infants with rhinitis without general malaise and infants without nasal symptoms was studied. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent pathogen during URTI and rhinitis in 0- to 2-year-old infants ( approximately 40%). During URTI, also respiratory syncytial virus ( approximately 20%) and coronavirus ( approximately 10%) infections were found, which were rarely detected in infants with rhinitis. Surprisingly, in 20% of infants who did not present with nasal symptoms, rhinovirus infections were also detected. During routine visits at 12 months, a higher prevalence of rhinovirus infections was found in infants who attended day-care compared with those who did not. We did not observe a relation between breast-feeding or smoking by one or both parents and the prevalence of rhinovirus infections. The parental history of atopy was not related to the prevalence of rhinovirus infection, indicating that the genetic risk of allergic disease does not seem to increase the chance of rhinovirus infections. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection is the most prevalent respiratory viral infection in infants. It may therefore affect the maturation of the immune system and the development of allergic disease considerably.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Sex is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the epidemiology and outcome of many diseases. This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females., CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.

N2  - Acute bronchiolitis, mostly seen in infants and younger children, is a lower respiratory tract infection frequently caused by viral agents. We aimed to determine the frequency of a broad panel of respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV) and to assess the clinical characteristics of acute bronchiolitis in a group of children under 24 months of age. A total of 62 children (45 male, 17 female; age range: 0-2 years) with the initial diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and 33 healthy children (21 male, 12 female; age range: 0-2 years) as control group who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of Mersin University Hospital, southern Turkey, from January to July 2010 were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the study groups and the detection of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A & B; rhinovirus (RV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A & B; influenza virus type A [H1N1, H3N2, H1N1v], B & C; parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1, 2, 3 & 4A/B; adenovirus (AdV); HBoV; coronavirus (CoV 229E); enterovirus (EV)], were performed by using a commercial system namely CLART RPneumovir (Clinical Array Technology, Genomica, Spain) based on the principle of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) and DNA microarray. Demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients, treatment protocols and the relationship between the length of hospitalization and the viral agents determined were also evaluated. Of the 62 samples collected from bronchiolitis cases, at least one virus was detected in 52 (83.9%) and viral co-infections were detected in 31 (50%) of them. Including the co-infections, RSV was the most commonly identified virus (n= 21; 33.9%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 18; 29%), RV (n= 18; 29%), hMPV (n= 13; 21%), PIV (n= 10; 16.1%), AdV (n= 5; 8%), HBoV (n= 3; 4.8%) and EV (n= 1; 1.6%). Of the 33 samples from healthy children, at least one virus was detected in 21 (63.6%) and viral co-infections were detected in seven (21.2%) samples. Including the co-infections, the most commonly detected virus was RV (n= 10; 30.3%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 6; 18.1%), AdV (n= 6; 18.1%), RSV (n= 4; 12.1%) and PIV (n= 3; 9%), however HBoV and hMPV were not detected in the control group. The differences of demographic features (age, gender, history of atopy, exposure of smoking, length of breast-feeding, presence of school-age sibling) and frequency of virus detection (83.9% and 63.6%, respectively) between the patient and control groups were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). The most common complaints of patients on admission were cough (100%), runny nose (82.3%) and respiratory difficulty (71%), whereas fever was present in 21 (33.9%) patients. The most common findings on physical examination were prolonged expirium (98.4%), rhonchi (98.4%), rales (80.6%), tachypnea (71%) and tachycardia (67.7%). Pulmonary graphies revealed that diffuse air trappings were more common in virus-associated bronchiolitis (36/52; 69.2%) cases, on the other hand infiltrations were more common (6/10; 60%) in patients who were virus-negative (p< 0.05). The demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings, clinical severity scores, hospitalization rates and duration of hospitalizations in bronchiolitis cases did not show statistically significant differences between the viral agents (p> 0.05 for each parameter). However the rates of antibiotic and steroid use in hospitalized patients (24/34 and 5/34, respectively) were significantly higher than those of outpatients (7/28 and 0/28, respectively) (p= 0.001 and p= 0.03). Our data indicated a high rate (~84%) of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the Mersin province and the detection of hMPV (21%) and HBoV (4.8%) only in the patient group encouraged their roles in the etiology of acute brochiolitis. It was concluded that viral etiology should be investigated in selected cases to prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment and to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy when necessary.

N2  - Although it is well established that cigarette smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections, data from recent studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among patients with COVID-19. This has led to claims that a 'smoker's paradox' may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker's paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.

N2  - A novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, related infection is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 but spread rapidly to be declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The patients typically present with fever and shortness of breath. We describe a case of spontaneous pneumomediastinum at presentation as a complication of severe Covid-19 infection. A 54 year old male patient with no history of smoking, asthma or other underlying chronic lung disease, presented to our emergency department with severe Covid-19 symptoms. His chest x-ray and CT scan on arrival at the emergency department, and prior to any intervention, demonstrated severe bilateral Covid-19 pneumonia complicated by a pneumomediastinum. The aetiology of the pneumomediastinum is thought to be a direct complication of severe covid-19 pneumonia in absence of any previous respiratory history or iatrogenic cause.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has major effects on the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes among patients, producing severe symptoms and death. Smoking has been reported as one of the factors that increases severity and mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of smoking on such medical outcomes is still controversial. This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) on the association between smoking and negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google Scholar, were systematically searched from the initiation of the database until 12 December 2020. All relevant studies about smoking and COVID-19 were screened using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of eligible articles. Random meta-analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test., RESULTS: A total of 1248 studies were retrieved and reviewed. A total of 40 studies were finally included for meta-analysis. Both current smoking and former smoking significantly increase the risk of disease severity (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.16-2.15, p=0.004; and OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.64-3.77, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. Similarly, current smoking and former smoking also significantly increase the risk of death (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.12-1.62, p=0.002; and OR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.15-3.09, p<0.001; respectively) with moderate appearance of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias, which was tested by the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's test., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, even current smoking or former smoking, significantly increases the risk of COVID-19 severity and death. Further causational studies on this association and ascertianing the underlying mechanisms of this relation is warranted. Copyright © 2021 Umnuaypornlert A. et al.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the clinical and demographical profile of corona-virus illness among Tablighi Jamaat and Zaireen kept in quarantine / isolation center at Sukkur and Hyderabad Sindh., Methods: The cross-sectional descriptive study (late March-2020 to mid of April-2020) was conducted at Diagnostic & Research Laboratory LUMHS Jamshoro / Hyderabad. All the suspected cases for COVID-19 were recruited and screened for corona virus infection. The study explored the data of the suspected and diagnosed (confirmed) case of COVID-2019 (Tablighi Jamaat and Zaireen) reported by Diagnostic Research Laboratory Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro who belonged to various parts of the country in general and province Sindh in particular. All the individuals regardless of age and gender presented either as asymptomatic, critical ill or having non-specific symptoms as fever, flu, cough; sore throat and shortness of breath were screened for COVID-19 by real time PCR after taking informed consent whereas the frequency / percentages (%) and means +/-SD computed for study variables., Results: During study period total 920 patients were explored and screened for Corona virus infection. The mean +/- SD for age (yrs) of overall population of city Sukkur and Hyderabad was 57.83+/-8.84 and 59.62+/-9.72 respectively. The 700 people from Sukkur city was screened and out of them 276 (39.4%) were positive and 424 (60.5) were negative while the cure rate was 245 (88.7%) along with mean +/- SD for recovery time was 9.41+/-2.97. The 220 people from Hyderabad city was screened and out of them 106 (48.1%) were positive and 114 (51.8%) were negative while the cure rate was 106 (100%) along with mean +/- SD for recovery time was 11.54+/-3.42. The majority of cases at both centers were asymptomatic (90%), symptomatic (7%) and critically ill (3%). The mortality accounted for 2.8% cases at Hyderabad isolation center and all were having smoking history and co-morbidities as ischemic heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, obstructive lung disease and cerebrovascular accident whereas no mortality was observed at Sukkur isolation center., Conclusion: RT-PCR measure allowed fast, delicate, and explicit discovery of SARS-CoV in biochemical diagnosis. The majority of cases at both centers were asymptomatic while the mortality was identified in 2.8% cases (having co-morbidities) at Hyderabad isolation center whereas no mortality was observed at Sukkur isolation center.

N2  - Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which emerged from China and spread all over the world, has affected the world in every aspect and will do so in the foreseeable future. This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement., Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization., Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 +/- 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant., Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.

N2  - This study focuses on how socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence self-protective behaviours during a pandemic, with protection behaviours being assessed through three perspectives - social distancing, personal protection behaviour and social responsibility awareness. The research considers a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and utilises a data analysis framework combining Classification and Regression Tree (CART), a data mining approach, and regression analysis to gain deep insights. The analysis reveals Socio-demographic attributes - sex, marital family status and having children - as having played an influential role in Japanese citizens' abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours. Especially women with children are noted as more conscious than their male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact concerning social distancing. Trust in government also appears as a significant factor. The analysis further identifies smoking behaviour as a factor characterising subjective prevention actions with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers being more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during pandemics and national emergencies.

T1  - The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in smoking behavior: Evidence from a nationwide survey in the UK.
A1  - Tzu-Hsuan Chen, Daniel
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: The stress and anxiety during this unprecedented public health crisis may lead current smokers to increase tobacco use or former smokers to relapse. Thus, this study aims to provide epidemiological evidence of the changes in smoking behavior among British smokers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the impact of psychosocial factors on these behaviors., METHODS: A nationwide survey of a representative sample of 4075 UK respondents aged >16 years was conducted between 27 April and 24 May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial and demographic variables between different smoking behavior groups were compared using Pearson's chi2 test and Cramer's V., RESULTS: Among current smokers (n=329), one-quarter (25.2%, n=86) reported smoking more than usual, 50.9% (n=174) reported smoking the same amount, and 20.2% (n=69) reported smoking less. Significant associations were observed between different smoking behavior groups and psychosocial factors. Pearson's chi2 test revealed significant differences between different smoking behavior groups in their concerns about mental health (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and stress (p<0.001), state of low mood (p=0.012), in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score (p=0.018) and ranking on the Cantril Ladder scale (p<0.001). Many respondents expressed that the pandemic had a more negative impact on their mental health and the impact was more pronounced among those who smoked more., CONCLUSIONS: Deterioration of mental health and psychosocial well-being were linked to increased smoking. Public health authorities should take proactive measures to provide mental healthcare and smoking cessation support as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic. Copyright © Chen T. H.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: This ecological study investigates the association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence and mortality in 38 European nations as of May 30, 2020., METHODS: Data were collected from Our World in Data. Regression analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (gross domestic product), the rate of COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies., RESULTS: There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million people and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with stricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association was not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between COVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023)., CONCLUSIONS: We found a negative association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence at the population level in 38 European countries. This association may not imply a true or causal relationship, and smoking is not advocated as a prevention or treatment of COVID-19., IMPLICATIONS: Given the evidence of this ecological study, and of several other studies that found an underrepresentation of smoking prevalence in hospitalized cases, it may be worth examining, in laboratory experiments and controlled human trials, if nicotine offers any protection against COVID-19. Most importantly, to date, no study, including this one, supports the view that smoking acts as a treatment intervention or prophylaxis to reduce the impact or ameliorate the negative health impacts of COVID-19.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined impacts and interactions of COVID-19 response involvement, health-related behaviours and health literacy (HL) on anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among healthcare workers (HCWs)., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected 6 April to 19 April 2020 using online-based, self-administered questionnaires., SETTING: 19 hospitals and health centres in Vietnam., PARTICIPANTS: 7 124 HCWs aged 21-60 years., RESULTS: The COVID-19 response-involved HCWs had higher anxiety likelihood (OR (95% CI)=4.41 (3.53 to 5.51)), higher depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=3.31 (2.71 to 4.05)) and lower HRQoL score (coefficient, b(95% CI)=-2.14 (-2.89 to -1.38)), compared with uninvolved HCWs. Overall, HCWs who smoked or drank at unchanged/increased levels had higher likelihood of anxiety, depression and lower HRQoL scores; those with unchanged/healthier eating, unchanged/more physical activity and higher HL scores had lower likelihood of anxiety, depression and higher HRQoL scores. In comparison to uninvolved HCWs who smoked or drank at never/stopped/reduced levels, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased smoking or drinking had lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.34 (0.14 to 0.83)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.26 (0.11 to 0.60)), and lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.33 (0.15 to 0.74)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.24 (0.11 to 0.53)), respectively. In comparison with uninvolved HCWs who exercised at never/stopped/reduced levels, or with those in the lowest HL quartile, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased exercise or with one-quartile HL increment reported lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.50 (0.31 to 0.81)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.57 (0.45 to 0.71)), lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.40 (0.27 to 0.61)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)), and higher HRQoL scores (b(95% CI)=2.08 (0.58 to 3.58)), or (b(95% CI)=1.10 (0.42 to 1.78)), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and higher HL were found to protect against anxiety and depression and were associated with higher HRQoL. Unexpectedly, smoking and drinking were also found to be coping behaviours. It is important to have strategic approaches that protect HCWs' mental health and HRQoL.

N2  - This study aimed to build an easily applicable prognostic model based on routine clinical, radiological, and laboratory data available at admission, to predict mortality in coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) hospitalized patients., METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical information from 1968 patients admitted to a hospital. We built a predictive score based on a logistic regression model in which explicative variables were discretized using classification trees that facilitated the identification of the optimal sections in order to predict inpatient mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. These sections were translated into a score indicating the probability of a patient's death, thus making the results easy to interpret., RESULTS: Median age was 67 years, 1104 patients (56.4%) were male, and 325 (16.5%) died during hospitalization. Our final model identified nine key features: age, oxygen saturation, smoking, serum creatinine, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein, and sodium at admission. The discrimination of the model was excellent in the training, validation, and test samples (AUC: 0.865, 0.808, and 0.883, respectively). We constructed a prognostic scale to determine the probability of death associated with each score., CONCLUSIONS: We designed an easily applicable predictive model for early identification of patients at high risk of death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - There is an urgent need to address the devastating pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The efforts to understand the details of this disease in hope of providing effective treatments are commendable. It is clear now that the virus can cause far more damage in patients with comorbid conditions-particularly in those with respiratory, cardiovascular, or immune-compromised system-than in patients without such comorbidities. Drug use can further exacerbate the condition. In this regard, the ill effects of smoking are amply documented, and no doubt can be a confounding factor in COVID-19 progression. Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amoung patients suffering from psychotic disorders. The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions., METHODS: We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared., RESULTS: As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.

N2  - Olfactory and/or taste dysfunction are potential neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the study was to document the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19 positive patients and analyze the effect of various factors on the occurrence of these chemosensory dysfunction in the local population. Tertiary referral center. Prospective Study. 250 subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and admitted in Isolation ward were enrolled for the study. Data was collected from the subjects via oral questionnaire method, based on the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool. Data was collected regarding the age, gender, olfactory or gustatory disturbances, history of recent travel or contact with a positive case, smoking, any associated symptoms, any co-morbid conditions and recovery time of sense of olfaction. Out of 250, 179 (71.6%) subjects were diagnosed with Olfactory dysfunction out of which majority were males, 105 (58.6%). Most of the patients were above 40 years of age (n = 184, 73.6%). Majority of the individuals (88 patients) had close contact with a positive case in recent past, followed by 67 patients who were health care workers, hence proving that risk of infection increases with exposure. Anosmia was present in 68.5% of all the 127 non-smokers. 66.4% had both olfactory as well as gustatory dysfunction whereas 18 patients (7.2%) were found to be totally asymptomatic. Mostly patients recovered their sense of smell within 1-2 weeks from the day of onset of anosmia. Presence of olfactory dysfunction of any degree with or without alteration in taste sensation should raise a suspicion of COVID-19 infection, especially when other classical signs are not present. In such conditions, swabs should be sent for confirmation by RT-PCR testing and till results are awaited, the individual should be shifted to quarantine facilities or advised strict self-isolation.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - PURPOSE: It has come to our attention that specific vascular changes (VCs) appear more frequently in chest computed tomography (CT) of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease., METHODS: CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT., RESULTS: VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.7+/-6.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs., CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.

N2  - Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, and therefore the prevention and treatment of this disease is an important priority of world health. In the present study, some risk factors, including unhealthy nutrition, obesity, and physical inactivity, were assessed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on the severity and duration of disease were evaluated., Subject and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected from all patients who visited the respiratory emergency department from March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020 in the University Hospital. The outcome measures were body mass index, diet quality that was evaluated with a 16-item food intake questionnaire, and physical activity level that was assessed by the global physical activity questionnaire., Results: Two hundred and six patients' data was analyzed. The results investigated that patients with lower levels of physical activity or lower MET.min/week were affected by a more severe form of the disease (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). We found that patients with a healthier dietary pattern were affected by lower severity of illness (p < 0.05)., Conclusion: It seems that increasing levels of physical activity may partly reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. Some dietary patterns such as increasing fruit and poultry consumption as well as drinking less tea were correlated significantly with a less severe form of the disease. The results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potentially harmful effect of smoking on the severity or duration of symptoms.

N2  - AIMS: To estimate (1) associations between self-reported COVID-19, hand-washing, smoking status, e-cigarette use and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and (2) the extent to which COVID-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts and more smoking inside the home., DESIGN: Cross-sectional household surveys., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged >= 18 years., MEASUREMENTS: Participants who reported that they definitely or thought they had coronavirus were classified as having self-reported COVID-19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home., FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in self-reported COVID-19 by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand-washing before face-touching, engagement in hand-washing behaviours was high (> 85%), regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were reportedly triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one in 10 current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: In England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers appear to have higher odds of self-reported COVID-19 compared with never smokers in adjusted analyses, but there were no large differences between people who used nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes. Engagement in hand-washing appears to be high, regardless of nicotine or tobacco use. A minority of past-year smokers and current e-cigarette users, respectively, report attempting to quit smoking/vaping due to COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Lockdown, social isolation, and interruption of daily life during the COVID-19 period have impacted many lives. University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28 years (mean age 21.4 years [SD = 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress. Potential protective factors included being male, having lower SES, living in rural areas, regular physical exercise, and satisfactory study. Suicidal ideation was prevalent among Bangladeshi university students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the correlates of suicidal ideation may aid to develop targeted strategies to support students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28 years (mean age 21.4 years [SD = 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress. Potential protective factors included being male, having lower SES, living in rural areas, regular physical exercise, and satisfactory study. Suicidal ideation was prevalent among Bangladeshi university students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the correlates of suicidal ideation may aid to develop targeted strategies to support students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In Italy, the epidemic explosion stage of COVID-19 seems to have been overcome; however, the virus has not been eradicated and the re-emergence of some outbreaks of infection substantiates the danger that the disease may persist. It is therefore necessary to keep the level of surveillance high, to maintain social distancing measures and to act in the control of disease risk factors of a serious or complicated course. Among the risk factors of severe COVID-19 in addition to age, male gender, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, a major role seems to be played by other cardiovascular risk factors conditioned by an unhealthy lifestyle such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and smoking. The new phase requires the maintenance of measures that avoid crowding and close interpersonal contact especially during exercise, in addition to controlled access to hospitals. This will require the reorganization of the traditional methods of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation activities, such as gyms and collective educational sessions, and the dilution of outpatient checks. The risk that this scenario may worsen the already suboptimal control of cardiovascular risk factors is therefore real. We do not currently know how long this new phase will last, therefore it is necessary to give impetus to new tele-health initiatives to stimulate the adoption of a healthy lifestyle in primary prevention and tele-monitoring and tele-rehabilitation programs in secondary prevention.

N2  - Background: The number of asymptomatic infected patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is rampaging around the world but limited information aimed on risk factors of asymptomatic infections. The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors of symptoms onset and clinical features in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 70 asymptomatic COVID-2019 infected patients confirmed by nucleic acid tests in Hunan province, China between 28 January 2020 and 18 February, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical features and laboratory data were reviewed and analyzed. Presence or absence at the onset of symptoms was taken as the outcome. A Cox regression model was performed to evaluate the potential predictors of the onset of symptoms. Results: The study included 36 males and 34 females with a mean age of 33.24+/-20.40 years (range, 0.5-84 years). There were 22 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms during hospitalization isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases, while 48 cases remained asymptomatic throughout the course of disease. Of 70 asymptomatic patients, 14 (14/70, 20%) had underlying diseases, 3 (3/70, 4.3%) had drinking history, and 11 (11/70, 15.7%) had smoking history. 22 patients developed symptoms onset of fever (4/22, 18.2%), cough (13/22, 59.1%), chest discomfort (2/22, 9.1%), fatigue (1/22, 4.5%), pharyngalgia (1/22, 4.5%) during hospitalization; only one (1/22, 4.5%) patient developed signs of both cough and pharyngalgia. Abnormalities on chest CT were detected among 35 of the 69 patients (50.7%) after admission, except for one pregnant woman had not been examined. 4 (4/70, 5.7%) and 8 (8/70, 11.4%) cases showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. With the effective antiviral treatment, all the 70 asymptomatic infections had been discharged, none cases developed severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit, or died. The mean time from nucleic acid positive to negative was 13.2+/-6.84 days. Cox regression analysis showed that smoking history (P=0.028, hazard ratio=4.49, 95% CI 1.18-17.08) and existence of pulmonary disease (P=0.038, hazard ratio=7.09, 95% CI 1.12-44.90) were risk factors of the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carries. Conclusion:  The initially asymptomatic patients can develop mild symptoms and have a good prognosis. History of smoking and pulmonary disease was prone to illness onset in asymptomatic patients, and it is necessary to be highly vigilant to those patients. Copyright © The author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anosmia is common in Coronavirus disease 2019, but its impact on prognosis is unknown. We analysed whether anosmia predicts in-hospital mortality; and if patients with anosmia have a different clinical presentation, inflammatory response, or disease severity., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. We determined all-cause mortality and need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We registered the first and worst laboratory parameters. Statistical analysis was done by multivariate logistic and linear regression., RESULTS: We included 576 patients, 43.3% female, and aged 67.2 years in mean. Anosmia was present in 146 (25.3%) patients. Patients with anosmia were more frequently females, younger and less disabled and had less frequently hypertension, diabetes, smoking habit, cardiac and neurological comorbidities. Anosmia was independently associated with lower mortality (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.069-0.472) and ICU admission (OR: 0.438, 95% CI: 0.229-0.838, p = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, patients with anosmia had a higher frequency of cough (OR: 1.96, 95%CI: 1.18-3.28), headache (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.66-4.03), and myalgia (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12-2.71). They had higher adjusted values of hemoglobin (+0.87, 95% CI: 0.40-1.34), lymphocytes (+849.24, 95% CI: 157.45-1541.04), glomerular filtration rate (+6.42, 95% CI: 2.14-10.71), and lower D-dimer (-4886.52, 95% CI: -8655.29-(-1117.75)), and C-reactive protein (-24.92, 95% CI: -47.35-(-2.48))., CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Covid-19 patients with anosmia had a lower adjusted mortality rate and less severe course of the disease. This could be related to a distinct clinical presentation and a different inflammatory response. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: The knowledge regarding the demographic characteristics of patients with Covid-19 and risk factors distribution is still evolving. Considering the role of cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of lung diseases and the effect of nicotine on expression of the entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is important to determine the implications of smoking in COVID-19. Methods: In this brief report, by using the published articles in the literature, we aimed to compare the reported prevalence of smoking in patients with COVID-19 to the prevalence of smoking in the general population of the corresponding report. Binomial tests were conducted and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among the screened papers, we found 12 peer-reviewed articles in which epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, including smoking status, were stated. Based on the descriptive reports of characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we observed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 patients with smoking history compared to what is expected, given the population average for each study's geographic area. Conclusion:  This analysis of available data showed a lower prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 patients in comparison to the regional average. Considering the limitations of the study, the results should be interpreted with great caution and be viewed just as a preliminary report to motivate related basic and clinical researches.

N2  - Background: Substances that can be vaped include nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and a range of synthetic drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the "Monitoring the Future" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12th graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12th-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Since December 2019, the world has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but the factors affecting the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well described. In this article, we provide a novel hypothesis to describe how an increase in cellular adenosine triphosphate (c-ATP) can potentially improve the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems to either prevent or fight off COVID-19.

T1  - COVID-19 and diabetes: Is there enough evidence?.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent data showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, data indicate that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are important risk factors for progression and unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 patients. There is only limited amount of data regarding follow-up of these patients, and they provided conflicting results. The main limitation is a small number of participants and particularly those who experienced primary composite outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). Additionally, the limited number of patients was essential obstacle for performing analysis that would include many confounding factors such as advanced age, smoking status, and obesity and potentially change conclusion. So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of diabetes on mortality in COVID-19 patients, but there are many speculations about the association between diabetes and susceptibility to novel coronavirus, as well as its impact on progression and prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this review article was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and its role in outcome in these patients.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - We discuss the implications of possible contagion of COVID-19 through e-cigarette aerosol (ECA) for prevention and mitigation strategies during the current pandemic. This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1-2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6-200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a "control case" of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44-176% for speaking 6-24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.

N2  - This study was to observe smoking behaviours and infection control behaviours in smokers at outdoor smoking hotspots during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We conducted unobtrusive observations at nine hotspots during 1 July 2019-31 January 2020 (pre-outbreak, 39 observations), 1 February-30 April 2020 (outbreak, eight observations), and 1 May-11 June 2020 (since-outbreak, 20 observations). Sex, age group, type of tobacco products used, duration of stay, group smoking behaviours, face mask wearing and infection control behaviours of smokers, and mask wearing of non-smoking pedestrians were observed. Compared with pre-outbreak, lower volumes of smokers were observed during outbreak and since-outbreak. Smokers gathered more in a group (24.5% and 25.8% vs. 13.4%, respectively) and stayed longer (91.5% and 83.6% vs. 80.6% stayed >=1 min) during outbreak and since-outbreak than pre-outbreak. Ninety-six percent smokers possessed a face mask. While smoking, 81.6% of smokers put the mask under the chin and 13.8% carried it in the hand, 32.4% did not wear a mask immediately after smoking, 98.0% did not sanitize hands, and 74.3% did not keep a distance of at least one metre. During the COVID-19 pandemic, smokers gathered closely and stayed longer at the hotspots, and few practised hand hygiene, all of which may increase the risk of infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures may have increased the risk of abusing addictive substances as well as addictive behaviors., METHODS: We present an initial online survey in 6416 Chinese about the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and addictive behavior in China., RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 46.8% of the subjects reported increased dependence on internet use, and 16.6% had longer hours of internet use. The prevalence (4.3%) of severe internet dependence rose up to 23% than that (3.5%) before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, and their dependence degree rose 20 times more often than being declined (60% vs 3%). Relapses to abuse from alcohol and smoking abstinence were relatively common at 19% and 25%, respectively. Similarly, 32% of regular alcohol drinkers and 20% of regular smokers increased their usage amount during the pandemic., CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: These three coping behaviors (internet, alcohol, and smoking) during this COVID-19-related crisis appear to have increased the risk for substance use disorders and internet addiction.

N2  - Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, health care exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled in a population-based study before the pandemic (n = 67 cancer patients; n = 256 noncancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to 4.18) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 5.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A higher incidence of COVID-19 infection was demonstrated in cancer patients, including lung cancer patients. This study was conducted to get insights into the enhanced frequency of COVID-19 infection in this disease., METHODS: Using different bioinformatics tools, the expression and methylation patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were analyzed in healthy and malignant tissues, focusing on lung adenocarcinoma and data were correlated to clinical parameters and smoking history., RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were heterogeneously expressed across 36 healthy tissues with the highest expression levels in digestive, urinary and reproductive organs, while the overall analysis of 72 paired tissues demonstrated significantly lower expression levels of ACE2 in cancer tissues when compared to normal counterparts. In contrast, ACE2, but not TMPRSS2, was overexpressed in LUAD, which inversely correlated to the promoter methylation. This upregulation of ACE2 was age-dependent in LUAD, but not in normal lung tissues. TMPRSS2 expression in non-neoplastic lung tissues was heterogeneous and dependent on sex and smoking history, while it was downregulated in LUAD of smokers. Cancer progression was associated with a decreased TMPRSS2, but unaltered ACE2. In contrast, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 of lung metastases derived from different cancer subtypes was higher than organ metastases of other sites. TMPRSS2, but not ACE2, was associated with LUAD patients' survival., CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive molecular analyses revealed a heterogeneous and distinct expression and/or methylation profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in healthy lung vs. LUAD tissues across sex, age and smoking history and might have implications for COVID-19 disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, reinforcing the urgency of smoking cessation in populations with high smoking prevalence such as individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Whether the COVID-19 pandemic has altered perceptions, motivation to quit, or tobacco use among cigarette smokers and nicotine e-cigarette vapers with OUD is unknown., METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in March-July 2020 of current cigarette smokers or nicotine vapers with OUD who were stable on buprenorphine treatment at five Boston (MA) area community health centers. The survey assessed respondents' perceived risk of COVID-19 due to smoking or vaping, interest in quitting, quit attempts and change in tobacco consumption during the pandemic., RESULTS: 222/520 patients (43 %) completed the survey, and 145 were asked questions related to COVID-19. Of these, 61 % smoked cigarettes only, 13 % vaped nicotine only, and 26 % were dual users. Nearly 80 % of participants believed that smoking and vaping increased their risk of COVID-19 infection or complications. Smokers with this belief reported an increased interest in quitting (AOR 4.6, 95 % CI:1.7-12.4). Overall, 49 % of smokers and 42 % of vapers reported increased interest in quitting due to the pandemic; 24 % and 20 %, respectively, reported attempting to quit since the pandemic. However, 35 % of smokers and 27 % of vapers reported increasing smoking and vaping, respectively, during the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with OUD believed that smoking and vaping increased their vulnerability to COVID-19, half reported increased interest in quitting, but others reported increasing smoking and vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases., METHODS: Physician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. Age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis, disease activity and medications were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. Analyses were further stratified according to rheumatic disease category., RESULTS: Of 3729 patients (mean age 57 years, 68% female), 390 (10.5%) died. Independent factors associated with COVID-19-related death were age (66-75 years: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.22; >75 years: 6.18, 4.47 to 8.53; both vs <=65 years), male sex (1.46, 1.11 to 1.91), hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease (1.89, 1.31 to 2.73), chronic lung disease (1.68, 1.26 to 2.25) and prednisolone-equivalent dosage >10 mg/day (1.69, 1.18 to 2.41; vs no glucocorticoid intake). Moderate/high disease activity (vs remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death (1.87, 1.27 to 2.77). Rituximab (4.04, 2.32 to 7.03), sulfasalazine (3.60, 1.66 to 7.78), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate or tacrolimus: 2.22, 1.43 to 3.46) and not receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (2.11, 1.48 to 3.01) were associated with higher odds of death, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Other synthetic/biological DMARDs were not associated with COVID-19-related death., CONCLUSION: Among people with rheumatic disease, COVID-19-related death was associated with known general factors (older age, male sex and specific comorbidities) and disease-specific factors (disease activity and specific medications). The association with moderate/high disease activity highlights the importance of adequate disease control with DMARDs, preferably without increasing glucocorticoid dosages. Caution may be required with rituximab, sulfasalazine and some immunosuppressants. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health effects, including increased risk of respiratory infection. However, evidence specifically related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited., METHODS: COVID-19 case counts for 111 Canadian health regions were obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data portal. Annual PM2.5 data for 2000-2016 were estimated from a national exposure surface based on remote sensing, chemical transport modelling and ground observations, and minimum and maximum temperature data for 2000-2015 were based on a national interpolated surface derived from thin-plate smoothing splines. Population counts and sociodemographic data by health region were obtained from the 2016 census, and health data (self-rated health and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and selected chronic diseases) by health region, were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Data on total number of COVID-19 tests and changes in mobility comparing post-vs. pre-introduction of social distancing measures were available by province. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models., RESULTS: After controlling for province, temperature, demographic and health characteristics and days since peak incidence by health region, long-term PM2.5 exposure exhibited a positive association with COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.18 per mug/m3). This association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in analyses excluding provinces that reported cases only for aggregated health regions, excluding health regions with less than median population density, and restricted to the most highly affected provinces (Quebec and Ontario)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed a positive association between COVID-19 incidence and long-term PM2.5 exposure in Canadian health regions. The association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in more highly affected health regions and those with potentially less exposure measurement error. While our results generate hypotheses for further testing, they should be interpreted with caution and require further examination using study designs less prone to bias. Crown Copyright © 2020.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Management of osteoporosis is an important consideration for patients with femoral neck fractures due to the morbidity and mortality it poses. The input of orthogeriatric teams is invaluable in coordinating secondary fragility fracture prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid restructuring of health care teams and led to the redeployment of orthogeriatricians., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact COVID-19 had on the secondary prevention of fragility fractures among patients with femoral neck fractures, and to optimize management in this population., METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of patients with femoral neck fractures before and after the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A reaudit was conducted following the development of our new mnemonic, "MRS BAD BONES," which addressed key factors in the assessment and management of osteoporosis: medication review, rheumatology/renal advice, smoking cessation; blood tests, alcohol limits, DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan; bone-sparing medications, orthogeriatric review, nutrition, exercise, supplements. The Fisher exact test was used for comparison analyses between each phase., RESULTS: Data for 50 patients were available in each phase. The orthogeriatric team reviewed 88% (n=44) of patients prelockdown, which fell to 0% due to redeployment, before recovering to 38% (n=19) in the postintervention period. The lockdown brought a significant drop in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements from 81.6% (n=40) to 58.0% (n=29) (P=.02); of bone-sparing medications from 60.7% (n=17) to 18.2% (n=4) (P=.004), and DEXA scan requests from 40.1% (n=9) to 3.6% (n=1) (P=.003). Following the implementation of our mnemonic, there was a significant increase in the prescription of vitamin D/calcium supplements to 85.7% (n=42) (P=.003), bone-sparing medications to 72.4% (n=21) (P<.001), and DEXA scan requests to 60% (n=12) (P<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The redeployment of the orthogeriatric team, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in the study population. The "MRS BAD BONES" mnemonic significantly improved management and could be used in a wider setting. Copyright ©Alastair Stephens, Hannah Rudd, Emilia Stephens, Jayne Ward.

N2  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has enforced dramatic changes to daily living including economic and health impacts. Evidence for the impact of these changes on our physical and mental health and health behaviors is limited. We examined the associations between psychological distress and changes in selected health behaviors since the onset of COVID-19 in Australia. An online survey was distributed in April 2020 and included measures of depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, sleep, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking. The survey was completed by 1491 adults (mean age 50.5 +/- 14.9 years, 67% female). Negative change was reported for physical activity (48.9%), sleep (40.7%), alcohol (26.6%) and smoking (6.9%) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly higher scores in one or more psychological distress states were found for females, and those not in a relationship, in the lowest income category, aged 18-45 years, or with a chronic illness. Negative changes in physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake were associated with higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive health-related behaviors should be utilized to address increases in psychological distress during the pandemic. Ongoing evaluation of the impact of lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic is needed.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 has caused health impacts and disruptions globally. Electronic cigarette (ECIG) users may face additional impacts. This study examined impacts of COVID-19 on ECIG users. Methods: Concept mapping, a mixed-methods approach, was used to identify COVID-19 impacts on adult ECIG users. ECIG users (n = 93) provided statements completing a prompt: "A specific way Coronavirus/COVID-19 has affected my vaping/e-cigarette use, my vaping/e-cigarette related purchasing, or other vaping/e-cigarette related behaviors or issues is...". Participants generated 85 unique statements, sorted statements into groups of similar content and rated each statement on how true they were. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis identified thematic clusters. Mean cluster ratings were compared between sample subgroups. Results: Ten clusters were identified: Stocking up and Bulk Purchasing, Challenges in Obtaining ECIG Supplies, Alternative Purchasing Procedures, Increased ECIG use, Disruption of Routine and ECIG Use, Efforts to Decrease ECIG Use, Improving ECIG Skills, COVID-19 Health Concerns, Perceptions of ECIG Use and COVID-19, and COVID-19 Protection. More dependent ECIG users and dual users of ECIGs and cigarettes rated clusters higher than less dependent ECIG users and non-dual users. Conclusions: ECIG users may experience or perceive they face additional COVID-19 impacts, such as increased exposure, financial burdens, stress, and health risks.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hospital workers have been the most frequently and severely affected professional group during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have a big impact on transmission. In this context, innovative tools are required to measure the symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the spread of infection, and testing capabilities within hospitals in real time., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and test an effective and user-friendly tool to identify and track symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in hospital workers., METHODS: We developed and pilot tested Hospital Epidemics Tracker (HEpiTracker), a newly designed app to track the spread of COVID-19 among hospital workers. Hospital staff in 9 hospital centers across 5 Spanish regions (Andalusia, Balearics, Catalonia, Galicia, and Madrid) were invited to download the app on their phones and to register their daily body temperature, COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and general health score, as well as any polymerase chain reaction and serological test results., RESULTS: A total of 477 hospital staff participated in the study between April 8 and June 2, 2020. Of note, both health-related (n=329) and non-health-related (n=148) professionals participated in the study; over two-thirds of participants (68.8%) were health workers (43.4% physicians and 25.4% nurses), while the proportion of non-health-related workers by center ranged from 40% to 85%. Most participants were female (n=323, 67.5%), with a mean age of 45.4 years (SD 10.6). Regarding smoking habits, 13.0% and 34.2% of participants were current or former smokers, respectively. The daily reporting of symptoms was highly variable across participating hospitals; although we observed a decline in adherence after an initial participation peak in some hospitals, other sites were characterized by low participation rates throughout the study period., CONCLUSIONS: HEpiTracker is an already available tool to monitor COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in hospital workers. This tool has already been tested in real conditions. HEpiTracker is available in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. It has the potential to become a customized asset to be used in future COVID-19 pandemic waves and other environments., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04326400; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04326400.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - While the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide, there is much concern over the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate had varied temporally (as the epidemic has progressed) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries. We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. We found that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found several factors associated with temporal changes in case fatality rate both among variables describing comorbidity risk and demographic, economic and political variables. In particular, countries with the highest values of DALYs lost to cardiovascular, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases had the highest values of COVID-19 CFR. CFR was also positively associated with the death rate due to smoking in people over 70 years. Interestingly, CFR was negatively associated with share of death due to lower respiratory infections. Among the demographic, economic and political variables, CFR was positively associated with share of the population over 70, GDP per capita, and level of democracy, while it was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1000. Overall, these results emphasize the role of comorbidity and socio-economic factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the population level.

N2  - Background: Myocardial injury is a severe complication of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and inflammation has been suggested as a potential cause of myocardial injury. However, the correlation of myocardial injury with inflammation in COVID-19 patients has not been revealed so far. Method: This retrospective single-center cohort study enrolled 64 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Patients were categorized into two groups by the presence of myocardial injury on admission. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed in this study. Result: Of these patients, the mean age was 64.8 +/- 12.2 years old, and 34 (53.1%) were diagnosed with myocardial injury. Compared with non-myocardial injury patients, myocardial injury patients were older (67.8 +/- 10.3 vs. 61.3 +/- 13.3 years; P = 0.033), had more cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as smoking (16 [47.06%] vs. 7 [23.33%]; P = 0.048) and were more likely to develop CV comorbidities (13 [38.2%] vs. 2 [6.7%]; P = 0.003). Scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (median [interquartile range (IQR)] 19.0 [13.25-25.0] vs. 13.0 [9.25-18.75]; P = 0.005) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment systems (7.0 [5.0-10.0] vs. 4.5 [3.0-6.0]; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the myocardial injury group. In addition, patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality than those without myocardial injury (29 [85.29%] vs. 18 [60.00%]; P = 0.022). Cox regression suggested that myocardial injury was an independent risk factor for high mortality during the time from admission to death (hazard ratio [HR], 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-3.83]; P = 0.023). Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-1beta, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) exceeded the normal limits, and levels of hs-CRP, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were statistically higher in the myocardial injury group than in the non-myocardial injury group. Multiple-variate logistic regression showed that plasma levels of hs-CRP (odds ratio [OR] 6.23, [95% CI, 1.93-20.12], P = 0.002), IL-6 (OR 13.63, [95% CI, 3.33-55.71]; P < 0.001) and TNF-alpha (OR 19.95, [95% CI, 4.93-80.78]; P < 0.001) were positively correlated with the incidence of myocardial injury. Conclusion:  Myocardial injury is a common complication that serves as an independent risk factor for a high mortality rate among in-ICU patients with COVID-19. A high inflammatory burden may play a potential role in the occurrence of myocardial injury. Copyright © 2020 Song, Gao, Ran, Qian, Guo, Chang, Wu and Zhang.

N2  - We examined tobacco use changes in young adult college students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on smoking and vaping. First, we evaluated changes in tobacco use from pre to post campus closure focusing on smoking and electronic nicotine vaping frequency (days) and quantity (cigarettes/cartridges per day). Also, given the potential protective effects of pausing (temporarily or permanently discontinuing) smoking or vaping, we evaluated its predictors. We hypothesized that generalized anxiety and moving home would increase the odds of pausing. We also explored effects of COVID-related news exposure and seeking on tobacco use. We re-contacted young adults two years after they completed a study on alcohol and marijuana co-use. A subset (N = 83; 26.6% of the 312 respondents) were enrolled in college and reported use of cigarettes (n = 35) and/or e-cigarettes (n = 69) in the week prior to their campus closing (PC). Paired sample t-tests compared smoking and vaping frequency and quantity PC to past-week use since closing (SC). Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine predictors of pausing. Both smoking and vaping frequency decreased from PC to SC; however, decreased frequency did not correspond to reduced quantity. Twenty-four participants (28.9%) paused past-week use SC. Higher anxiety and moving home (versus living independently) were related to increased odds of pausing, whereas COVID-19 related news exposure and seeking were related to decreased odds of pausing. Characterizing COVID-19 related tobacco use change provides insights into how college students respond to novel health threats and informs potential interventions. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Brazil is, at the time of writing, the global epicenter of COVID-19, but information on risk factors for hospitalization and mortality in the country is still limited. Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients until June 11th, 2020 were retrieved from the State Health Secretariat of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and death were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 10,713 COVID-19 patients were included in this study; 81.0% were younger than 60 years, 55.2% were female, 89.2% were not hospitalized, 32.9% had at least one comorbidity, and 7.7% died. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (67.7%) and fever (62.6%); 7.1% of the patients were asymptomatic. Cardiovascular diseases (23.7%) and diabetes (10.3%) were the two most common chronic diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified an association of all explanatory variables, except for cough and diarrhea, with hospitalization. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.95, P < 0.001) and shortness of breath (OR = 3.55, P < 0.001) were associated with increase of odds to COVID-19 death in hospitalized patients. Our study provided evidence that older age, male gender, Asian, indigenous or unknown race, comorbidities (smoking, kidney disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), as well as fever and shortness of breath increased the risk of hospitalization. For death outcome in hospitalized patients, only older age and shortness of breath increased the risk.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Public health emergencies require real-time, accurate information to guide effective responses. Rapid publication of information can, therefore, advance both the scientific validity and the social value of research conducted in these contexts. Consequently, medical journals place a high priority on rapidly publishing reports on these emergencies, which the media often report on to the public. Today, the focus is on the rapid publication of research related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Tomorrow, it might be an influenza pandemic or a crisis related to a vaping-related illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population., METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and >=75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<15,000: reference; 25,000-<40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; 40,000-<60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and >=60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46)., CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of UK adults self-isolating/social distancing females, younger age groups, those with a lower annual income, current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health.

N2  - The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.

N2  - Background: Facial pressure ulcers are a rare yet significant complication. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that patients should be risk-assessed for pressure ulcers and measures instated to prevent such complication. In this study, we report case series of perioral pressure ulcers developed following the use of two devices to secure endotracheal tubes in COVID-19 positive patients managed in the intensive care setting., Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on sixteen patients identified to have perioral pressure ulcers by using the institutional risk management system. Data parameters included patient demographics (age, gender, comorbidities, smoking history and body mass index (BMI)). Data collection included the indication of admission to ITU, duration of intubation, types of medical devices utilised to secure the endotracheal tube, requirement of vasopressor agents and renal replacement therapy, presence of other associated ulcers, duration of proning and mortality., Results: Sixteen patients developed different patterns of perioral pressure ulcers related to the use of two medical devices (Insight, AnchorFast). The mean age was 58.6 years. The average length of intubation was 18.8 days. Fourteen patients required proning, with an average duration of 5.2 days., Conclusions: The two devices utilised to secure endotracheal tubes are associated with unique patterns of facial pressure ulcers. Measures should be taken to assess the skin regularly and avoid utilising devices that are associated with a high risk of facial pressure ulcers. Awareness and training should be provided to prevent such significant complication.Level of evidence: Level IV, risk/prognostic study.

N2  - Multiple medical, lifestyle, and environmental conditions, including smoking and particulate pollution, have been considered as risk factors for COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity. Taking into account the high level of toxic metals in both particulate matter (PM2.5) and tobacco smoke, the objective of this review is to discuss recent data on the role of heavy metal exposure in development of respiratory dysfunction, immunotoxicity, and severity of viral diseases in epidemiological and experimental studies, as to demonstrate the potential crossroads between heavy metal exposure and COVID-19 severity risk. The existing data demonstrate that As, Cd, Hg, and Pb exposure is associated with respiratory dysfunction and respiratory diseases (COPD, bronchitis). These observations corroborate laboratory findings on the role of heavy metal exposure in impaired mucociliary clearance, reduced barrier function, airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The association between heavy metal exposure and severity of viral diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus has been also demonstrated. The latter may be considered a consequence of adverse effects of metal exposure on adaptive immunity. Therefore, reduction of toxic metal exposure may be considered as a potential tool for reducing susceptibility and severity of viral diseases affecting the respiratory system, including COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Health crises have become a popular topic of discussion. In the wave of the ongoing pandemic, experts have suggested the role of vaping and other tobacco product use exemplifying the vulnerability of the population to contract the COVID-19. We discuss some of the events that led up to these conclusions and also offer a unique insight into another form of tobacco use that is potentially propagating its spread especially in the South Asian region-chewed tobacco. Both of these have been a perennial issue that head and neck cancer surgeons have been dealing with. Governments and head and neck cancer care providers now have an opportunity to deal with a common enemy in the midst of this pandemic. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The use of the Asian tobacco waterpipe (TWP) in the Lao People's Democratic Republic represents a potential communal source of infectious disease. This practice of smoking can lead to weakened defences of a smoker's respiratory epithelium, making the smoker vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019, tuberculosis and others., METHODS: This study evaluated the water quality and hygiene factors among 43 smokers of five villages in rural Luang Namtha Province. Water samples were collected from participant's TWPs and assessed for the presence of Escherichia coli, coliforms and aerobic plate count (APC) bacteria using the 3M Petrifilm., RESULTS: The microbial indicator testing results were 95% positive for the APC, 38% positive for coliforms and 17% positive for the E. coli indicator. The concentrations were highest for the APC, with an average of 106 colony forming units (cfu)/ml, followed by coliforms with <100 cfu/ml and lowest for E. coli with <10 cfu/ml. Most TWPs were infrequently cleaned, heavily used and contained a warm, brown-coloured water., CONCLUSIONS: The warm, dark and moist internal water container may facilitate microbial survival and growth. The use of a TWP adds several unstudied modes of transmission to a complex and common biobehavioural and environmental pathogen exposure. Future TWP cessation activities should be tailored to consider risks of infectious disease transmission. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - This study aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with tobacco use among patients living with HIV/HCV co-infection. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) were analyzed of patients living with HIV/HCV co-infection (n = 313) who presented for clinical evaluation and treatment of HCV between 2013 and 2017 at a university-affiliated HIV/HCV Co-infection Clinic. The prevalence of tobacco use in patients living with HIV/HCV co-infection was 48%. Compared to non-smokers, a higher proportion of tobacco smokers had substance use disorders and concurrent alcohol and substance use. In the multivariate analysis, concurrent alcohol and substance use was positively associated with tobacco use. The findings suggest clinical interventions are urgently needed to reduce tobacco use among patients living with HIV/HCV co-infection-a doubly-vulnerable immunocompromised population. Otherwise, failed efforts to dedicate resources and targeted behavioral interventions for this respective population will inhibit survival-especially considering the recent and evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - AIMS: To estimate the association of smoking status with rates of (i) infection, (ii) hospitalization, (iii) disease severity and (iv) mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 disease., DESIGN: Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv., SETTING: Community or hospital, no restrictions on location., PARTICIPANTS: Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis., MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor')., FINDINGS: Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, tau = 0.41]. Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, tau = 0.17), but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR >= 1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalization (RR = 1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, tau = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR = 1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, tau = 0.29) and mortality (RR = 1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, tau = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, tau = 0.27; RR = 1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, tau = 0.34; RR = 1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, tau = 0.49, respectively), but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalization and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR >= 1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR >= 1.1)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Addiction published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications and infections frequently affect patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic., METHODS: A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients., RESULTS: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks., CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors including age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use, has been reported in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who experienced adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death., RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9-15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models., CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presents an unprecedented diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians. Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 x 10(9) vs 4.6 x 10(9) neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk. The benefits of surgical management must be balanced against the potential risks to health-care workers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the clinical impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH). In this study, we compared outcomes for PLWH with COVID-19 to a matched comparison group., METHODS: We identified 88 PLWH hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital system in New York City between 12 March and 23 April 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory values, HIV status, treatment, and outcomes from this group and matched comparators (1 PLWH to up to 5 patients by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and calendar week of infection). We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes (death, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge) for these groups, as well as cumulative incidence of death by HIV status., RESULTS: Patients did not differ significantly by HIV status by age, sex, or race/ethnicity due to the matching algorithm. PLWH hospitalized with COVID-19 had high proportions of HIV virologic control on antiretroviral therapy. PLWH had greater proportions of smoking (P < .001) and comorbid illness than uninfected comparators. There was no difference in COVID-19 severity on admission by HIV status (P = .15). Poor outcomes for hospitalized PLWH were frequent but similar to proportions in comparators; 18% required mechanical ventilation and 21% died during follow-up (compared with 23% and 20%, respectively). There was similar cumulative incidence of death over time by HIV status (P = .94)., CONCLUSIONS: We found no differences in adverse outcomes associated with HIV infection for hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with a demographically similar patient group.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is turning out to be one of the most devastating global pandemics in the history of humankind. There is a shortage of effective therapeutic strategies or preventative vaccines for this disease to date. A rigorous investigation is needed for identifying and developing more effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis, has been identified as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. Smoking and vaping are potential risk factors for COVID-19 that are also shown to upregulate ACE2 expression. In this review, we have discussed the pathobiology of COVID-19 in the lungs and brain and the role of ACE2 in the transmission and pathobiology of this disease. Furthermore, we have shown possible interactions between nicotine/smoking and ACE2 in the lungs and brain, which could aggravate the transmission and pathobiology of COVID-19, resulting in a poor disease outcome. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review addresses the present global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with respect to its pathobiology in the lungs and brain. It focuses on the potential negative impact of tobacco and nicotine exposure on the outcomes of this disease by interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. It adds to the time-sensitive and critically important growing knowledge about the risk factors, transmission, pathobiology, and prognosis of COVID-19.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a communicable disease caused by a novel coronavirus., OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID-19, comorbidities, and smoking status., RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID-19 with a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID-19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients. Almost half of patients (47%) with COVID-19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2% reported diarrhea. Among 1942 interviewed patients, 54.2% reported at least 1 olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5% reported both alterations. Self-reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2% and 47.5%, respectively. Self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID-19 was significantly higher (P <0.001) in women than men., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Moreover, our study indicated sex differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019 in China, which later developed into a pandemic, has forced different countries to implement strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures. Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean +/- SD 3.0 +/- 1.6 kg) and loss (-2.9 +/- 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36-45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the influence of COVID-19 on smoking patterns in Pakistan., METHODS: In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis., RESULTS: We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020)., CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting., IMPLICATIONS: We observed significant and complex changes in people's smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary. If provided routinely, smoking cessation interventions can potentially support millions of highly motivated individuals in quitting successfully both in general as well as in global events like COVID-19, in particular.

N2  - Since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), a number of studies have reported the presence of cardiovascular diseases in affected patients and linked them with a higher risk of mortality. We conducted an online search in Medline/PubMed to identify original cohorts comparing data between survivors and non-survivors from COVID-19. The presence of cardiovascular events and related biomarkers were compared between the 2 groups. Data on 1,845 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were pooled from 12 comparative studies. The overall mortality rate in relation to COVID-19 was 17.6%. Men aged > 50 years old were more likely to die from COVID-19. Significant co-morbidities contributing to mortality were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, a previous history of cardiovascular disease including chronic heart failure, and cerebrovascular accidents. A significant relationship was observed between mortality and patient presentation with dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Cardiovascular disease-related laboratory biomarkers related to mortality were elevated serum level of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin I. Adverse cardiovascular disease-related clinical events preceding death were shock, arrhythmias, and acute myocardial injury. In conclusion, severe clinical presentation and elevated biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with established risk factors can predict mortality from cardiovascular causes.

N2  - Cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for severe disease and death from respiratory infection. Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms. These results highlight the potential utility in assessing level of worry about COVID-19, a transdiagnostic construct, among combustible cigarette smokers to better understand cognitive-affective factors that may maintain smoking behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on infectious diseases and their associations with host factors and underlying conditions. New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.

N2  - Background: News articles, commentaries, and opinion articles have suggested that ongoing social distancing measures coupled with economic challenges during COVID-19 may worsen stress, affective state, and substance use across the globe. We sought to advance our understanding of the differences between individuals who change their substance use patterns during a public health crisis and those who do not., Methods: Cross-sectional survey of young adults (18-25 years of age) assessing respondent characteristics and vaping, tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana use. We calculated prevalence estimates, prevalence changes, and prevalence ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals and looked for differences with the chi-square test., Results: Of the total sample, 53.2% (n = 542/1018) young adults reported vaping or using tobacco, alcohol, and/or marijuana. Among the 542 respondents reporting use, 34.3% reported a change in their use patterns. Among respondents reporting changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic (n = 186), 68.8% reported an increase in alcohol use, 44.0% reported a decrease in vaping product use, and 47.3% reported a decrease in tobacco product use due to COVID-19. Substance use changed significantly for respondents with increasing degree of loneliness (continuous loneliness score: prevalence ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.25), anxiety (prevalence ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.85), and depression (prevalence ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-1.82)., Conclusion: Self-reported substance use among young adults was observed to change during a pandemic, and the degree of loneliness appears to impact these changes. Innovative strategies are needed to address loneliness, anxiety, depression, and substance use during global health crises that impact social contact. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - 'Tree-in-bud' (TIB) appearance in computed tomography (CT) chest is most commonly a manifestation of infection. We here describe an unusual cause of TIB during the COVID-19 pandemic. A young male patient who had a history of fever, cough, and respiratory distress presented in the emergency department. As these symptoms matched with coronavirus infection, the COVID-19 test was done, which was found negative. He was then moved to the intensive care unit where he developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and was put on mechanical ventilation. Further workup did not reveal any source of infection, as all his cultures were negative, but his CT chest showed a tree-in-bud appearance. After obtaining a detailed history from his friends, the patient was found a chronic abuser of inhaled cocaine and treated with intravenous steroids. Subsequently, he was weaned from the ventilator and discharged from the intensive care unit after becoming asymptomatic.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - In Morocco, as in many countries, COVID-19 spread nationwide causing a public health emergency. Strict quarantine measures implemented as a result of the pandemic have disrupted many aspects of people's lives, triggering psychological distress. A total of 256 participants were recruited through a convenience sample. Data were collected through snowball sampling, an assessment of distress symptoms using the Brief Symptoms Inventory, and an assessment of leisure-time physical activity using the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Significant changes in paranoid ideation (z = -2.45, P = .01) and interpersonal sensitivity (z = -2.01, P = .04) dimensions were noted between those who were and those who were not authorized to leave their homes during quarantine. Similarly, for physical activity, significant changes in depression (z = -2.15, P = .03), anxiety (z = -2.13, P = .03), interpersonal sensitivity (z = -1.95, P = .05), and somatization (z = -2.11, P = .03) were reported among the insufficiently active group compared with the more physically active group. From multiple regression analysis, variables correlated with general distress were type of quarantine, gender, age, education level, chronic disease, and smoking (R2 = .80). With some variables, leisure-time physical activity domains appeared to be associated only with interpersonal sensitivity and somatization. Having to leave one's home during the outbreak was linked to distress, especially symptoms like suspiciousness, hostility, fearful thoughts of losing autonomy, and feelings of inadequacy, uneasiness, and discomfort during interpersonal interactions. Individuals who were moderately or sufficiently active physically reported less psychological distress.

N2  - Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes pneumonia with a relatively high case fatality rate in humans. Smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have been reported to be more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Here, we determined the expression of MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), in lung tissues of smokers without airflow limitation and COPD patients in comparison to nonsmoking individuals (never-smokers)., Methods: DPP4 expression was measured in lung tissue of lung resection specimens of never-smokers, smokers without airflow limitation, COPD GOLD stage II patients and in lung explants of end-stage COPD patients. Both control subjects and COPD patients were well phenotyped and age-matched. The mRNA expression was determined using qRT-PCR and protein expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry., Results: In smokers and subjects with COPD, both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher compared to never-smokers. Additionally, we found that both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters., Conclusions: We provide evidence that DPP4 is upregulated in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. These data also highlight a possible role of DPP4 in COPD pathogenesis. Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Prenatal influenza exposure increases the risk for schizophrenia and brings to question how other respiratory viruses may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease etiopathology. Human coronaviruses cause respiratory infections that range in seriousness from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Like influenza, coronaviruses can be neurotropic. To test for associations between coronaviruses and serious mental disorders, we utilized a recently developed assay and measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) response against 4 human coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) in 106 patients with a recent onset of psychotic symptoms and 196 nonpsychiatric controls. We expressed results quantitatively as antibody levels and qualitatively as seroprevalence relative to a defined seropositivity cutoff value. Patient IgG levels were higher than controls for HKU1, NL63, and OC43, with HKU1 and NL63 both showing highly significant patient-to-control differences (HKU1, P <= .002; NL63, P <= .00001). All 4 coronaviruses were more seroprevalent in patients vs controls, with greatest intergroup differences observed for HKU1 (93% vs 77%, P <= .0001). HKU1 and NL63 associations with the patient group were further supported by multivariate analyses that controlled for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status (HKU1, odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.67, P <= .027; NL63, OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.25-4.66, P <= .008). Among patients, NL63 was associated with schizophrenia-spectrum (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.27-7.58, P <= .013) but not mood disorders. HKU1 and NL63 coronavirus exposures may represent comorbid risk factors in neuropsychiatric disease. Future studies should explore links between the timing of coronavirus infections and subsequent development of schizophrenia and other disorders with psychotic symptoms.

N2  - Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections ranging from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P<or=0.009 and P<or=0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P<or=0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P<or=0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P<or=0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population. Demographic factors, such as race, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, may confer an increased risk of susceptibility to these viruses.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In earlier studies, patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) who got infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation than comparators. We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD., RESULTS: We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.68-1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.86-1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.53-1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.93-2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10% vs 19%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.17-1.12)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RMD and comparators had similar risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting for race, smoking and comorbidities. The higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the early RMD cohort was no longer detected in a recent cohort, suggesting improved management over time.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the receptor for SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of >=14 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age >=18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated., RESULTS: In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57+/-15 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27-1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.87, p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem)., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that exposure to ACEi drugs may have favorable effects in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Tobacco smoking is more prevalent among people who experience mental illness. It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.

T1  - Vascular Events, Vascular Disease and Vascular Risk Factors-Strongly Intertwined with COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Purpose of review: To elucidate the intertwining of vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors and COVID-19., Recent findings: Strokes are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Vascular risk factors are important drivers of strokes. There are unmodifiable vascular risk factors such as age and ethnicity and modifiable vascular risk factors. According to the INTERSTROKE study, the 10 most frequent modifiable vascular risk factors are arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, overweight, dyslipidaemia, smoking, unhealthy diet, cardiac pathologies, diabetes mellitus, stress/depression and overconsumption of alcohol. Also, infection and inflammation have been shown to increase the risk of stroke. There is high-quality evidence for the clinical benefits of optimal primary and secondary stroke prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a new perspective to this field. Vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors-and COVID-19-are strongly intertwined. An increased risk of vascular events-by multifactorial mechanisms-has been observed in COVID-19 patients. Also, a higher rate of infection with COVID-19, severe COVID-19 and bad outcome has been demonstrated in patients with pre-existing vascular disease and vascular risk factors., Summary: At present, we suggest that regular interactions between healthcare professionals and patients should include education on COVID-19 and on primary and secondary vascular prevention in order to reduce the burden of disease in our ageing populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound impact on health care not only for its direct effects, but also because it deeply influenced the whole clinical practice and diagnostic pathways, particularly in the acute setting., CASE REPORT: We present the case of a patient with respiratory dysfunction due to myasthenia gravis (MG) initially misdiagnosed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to ambiguity in the interpretation of radiological and microbiological findings during COVID-19 pandemic., DISCUSSION: Respiratory dysfunction as first clinical manifestation of myasthenia gravis is rare, but potentially very harmful. Emergency physicians should always consider neurological diseases when dyspnea cannot be explained by cardiac or respiratory causes.

N2  - Pan-immunoglobulin assays can simultaneously detect IgG, IgM and IgA directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig). In this work, we aim to evaluate a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) regarding analytical, diagnostic, operational and clinical characteristics. Our work takes the form of a population-based study in the principality of Liechtenstein, including 125 cases with clinically well-described and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1159 individuals without evidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 cases were tested for antibodies in sera taken with a median of 48 days (interquartile range, IQR, 43-52) and 139 days (IQR, 129-144) after symptom onset. Sera were also tested with other assays targeting antibodies against non-RBD-S1 and -S1/S2 epitopes. Sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 93.2-99.1), whereas specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.4-99.9). Antibody levels linearly decreased from hospitalized patients to symptomatic outpatients and SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms (p < 0.001). Among cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, smokers had lower antibody levels than non-smokers (p = 0.04), and patients with fever had higher antibody levels than patients without fever (p = 0.001). Pan-SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig in SARS-CoV-2 infection cases significantly increased from first to second follow-up (p < 0.001). A substantial proportion of individuals without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed non-S1-RBD antibody reactivities (248/1159, i.e., 21.4%, 95% CI, 19.1-23.4). In conclusion, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD Ig assay offers favorable and sustained assay characteristics allowing the determination of quantitative associations between clinical characteristics (e.g., disease severity, smoking or fever) and antibody levels. The assay could also help to identify individuals with antibodies of non-S1-RBD specificity with potential clinical cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding risk factors of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vis-a-vis asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, severe disease and death is important., METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted through telephonic interviews among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Jodhpur, India from 23 March to 20 July 2020. Contact history, comorbidities and tobacco and alcohol use were elicited using standard tools., RESULTS: Among 911 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 47.5% were symptomatic, 14.1% had severe COVID-19 and 41 (4.5%) died. Older age, working outside the home, cardiac and respiratory comorbidity and alcohol use were found to increase the risk of symptomatic disease as compared with asymptomatic infection. Current tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.26 to 0.78]) but not smokeless tobacco use (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.55 to 1.19]) appeared to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease. Age >=60 y and renal comorbidity were significantly associated with severe COVID-19. Age >=60 y and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity were found to predispose to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The apparent reduced risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among tobacco smokers could be due to residual confounding owing to unknown factors, while acknowledging the limitation of recall bias. Cross-protection afforded by frequent upper respiratory tract infection among tobacco smokers could explain why a similar association was not found for smokeless tobacco use, thereby being more plausible than the 'nicotinic hypothesis'. Those with comorbidities and age >=60 y should be prioritized for hospital admission. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have symptoms ranging from simple symptoms of colds to severe respiratory syndromes. In December 2019, cases of unknown pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan, China., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between occupation and COVID-19 in the Ardabil Imam Khomeini hospital., METHODS: This research was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study. The questionnaires used in this study included demographic information to obtain the required information such as age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying disease, type of drug used, smoking, occupation, hours of work, number of daily clients, use of mask or shield, type of working hours, weight and height and body mass index, number family, place of residence, role in the family, presence of an infected person in the family, communication with the suspect, observance or non-observance of health protocols. Our sample size consisted of 774 subjects, all patients at the Ardabil Imam Khomeini Hospital. The subjects were selected randomly., RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the mean age of patients was 56.70 years, with a standard deviation of 18.20 years. Three hundred and sixty participants (46.5%) were female, and 414 (53.5%) were male. In terms of occupation distribution, 317 patients (41%) were housewives. In addition, 57 people (7.4%) were farmers or ranchers., CONCLUSION: In general, it can be concluded that due to severity of infection and threat posed by Coronavirus and the risk of infections between different occupations like the taxi driver and medical staff, it is very important to find out what jobs are in the big threat.

N2  - Purpose: To determine whether the percentage of lung involvement at the initial chest computed tomography (CT) is related to the subsequent risk of in-hospital death in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19)., Materials and methods: Using a cohort of 154 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 pneumonia cases that underwent chest CT between February and April 2020, we performed a volumetric analysis of the lung opacities. The impact of relative lung involvement on outcomes was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. The primary endpoint was the in-hospital mortality rate. The secondary endpoint was major adverse hospitalization events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, or death)., Results: The median age of the patients was 65 years: 50.6 % were male, and 36.4 % had a history of smoking. The median relative lung involvement was 28.8 % (interquartile range 9.5-50.3). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 16.2 %. Thirty-six (26.3 %) patients were intubated. After adjusting for significant clinical factors, there was a 3.6 % increase in the chance of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.036; 95 % confidence interval, 1.010-1.063; P=0.007) and a 2.5 % increase in major adverse hospital events (OR 1.025; 95 % confidence interval, 1.009-1.042; P=0.002) per percentage unit of lung involvement. Advanced age (P=0.013), DNR/DNI status at admission (P<0.001) and smoking (P=0.008) also increased in-hospital mortality. Older (P=0.032) and male patients (P=0.026) had an increased probability of major adverse hospitalization events., Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, more lung consolidation on chest CT increases the risk of in-hospital death, independently of confounding clinical factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: An association between IL-6 levels and cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients has been suggested. Cases with higher IL-6 levels have more rapid progression and a higher complication rate. On the other hand, COVID-19 cases with anosmia have a milder course of the disease., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between serum IL-6 levels and presence of anosmia in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on laboratory (PCR) were stratified into two groups based on presence of olfactory dysfunction (OD). In all cases with and without anosmia; psychophysical test (Sniffin' Sticks test) and a survey on olfactory symptoms were obtained. Threshold (t) - discrimination (d) - identification (i), and total (TDI) scores reflecting olfactory function were calculated. Clinical symptoms, serum IL-6 levels, other laboratory parameters, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were included, comprising 23 patients with anosmia and 36 patients without OD based on TDI scores. Patients with anosmia (41.39 +/- 15.04) were significantly younger compared to cases without anosmia (52.19 +/- 18.50). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of comorbidities, smoking history, and symptoms including nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Although serum IL-6 levels of all patients were above normal values (7 pg/mL), patients with anosmia had significantly lower serum IL-6 levels (16.72 +/- 14.28 pg/mL) compared to patients without OD (60.95 +/- 89.33 pg/mL) (p = 0.026)., CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 related anosmia tend to have significantly lower serum levels of IL-6 compared to patients without OD, and the lower IL-6 levels is related to milder course of the disease. With the effect of low cytokine storm and IL-6 level, it may be said that anosmic cases have a milder disease in COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 70 countries around the world since its discovery in 2019. More than 2.5 million cases and more than 130,000 deaths have been reported in the United States alone. The common radiological presentation in this disease is noted to be the presence of ground glass opacities and/or consolidations. We report a case of 40-year-old male admitted for COVID-19 and rapidly deteriorated into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with no prior history of smoking or lung disease. The patient had normal imaging 3 days prior to admission to the hospital and rapidly developed a large pneumatocele with pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement that later on resolved. This is a unique radiologic finding in COVID-19 and likely related to severe inflammation secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the clinical care of well-established diseases, randomized trials, literature and research are supplemented by clinical judgment to understand disease prognosis and inform treatment choices. In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making. However, lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation of an impending crisis or pandemic., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a 'patients-like-me' framework to predict COVID-19 patient deterioration using a retrospective cohort of similar respiratory diseases., METHODS: Our framework used COVID-like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from an academic medical center, 2008-2019. Fifteen training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purpose. Two machine learning (ML) models were developed, one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features., RESULTS: Compared to the COVID-like cohorts (n=16,509), the COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of Hispanic ethnicity, lower proportion of smoking history and fewer comorbidities (P <0.001). COVID-19 patients had a lower IMV rate (15.1 vs 23.2, P=0.016) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 vs 4.1, P <0.001) compared to the COVID-like patients. In the COVID-like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUV > 0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the best performing model of predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUC: 0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all four COVID-like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUC: 0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc.). Our models suffered from class imbalance, that resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values., CONCLUSIONS: We provided a feasible framework for modeling patient deterioration using existing data and AI technology to address data limitations during the onset of a novel, rapidly changing pandemic., CLINICALTRIAL:

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly reaching over 3 million of confirmed cases worldwide. The association of respiratory diseases and smoking, both highly prevalent globally, with COVID-19 severity has not been elucidated. Given the gap in the evidence and the growing prevalence of COVID-19, the objective of this study was to explore the association of underlying respiratory diseases and smoking with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection., METHODS: A systematic search was performed to identify studies reporting prevalence of respiratory diseases and/or smoking in relation with disease severity in patients with confirm COVID-19, published between January 1 to April 15, 2020 in English language. Pooled odds-ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated., FINDINGS: Twenty two studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies presented data of 13,184 COVID-19 patients (55% males). Patients with severe outcomes were older and a larger percentage were males compared with the non-severe. Pooled analysis showed that prevalence of respiratory diseases (OR 4.21; 95% CI, 2.9-6.0) and smoking (current smoking OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.16-3.39 and former smoking OR 3.46; 95% CI, 2.46-4.85) were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes., INTERPRETATION: Results suggested that underlying respiratory diseases, specifically COPD, and smoking were associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings may support the planning of preventive interventions and could contribute to improvements in the assessment and management of patient risk factors in clinical practice, leading to the mitigation of severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.

N2  - COVID-19 has caused over 300,000 US deaths thus far, but its long-term health consequences are not clear. Policies to contain the pandemic have led to widespread economic problems, which likely increase stress and resulting health risk behaviors, particularly among women, who have been hardest hit both by job loss and caregiving responsibilities. Further, women with pre-existing disadvantage (e.g., those without health insurance) may be most at risk for stress and consequent health risk behavior. Our objective was to estimate the associations between financial stressors from COVID-19 and health risk behavior changes since COVID-19, with potential effect modification by insurance status. We used multilevel logistic regression to assess the relationships between COVID-19-related financial stressors (job loss, decreases in pay, trouble paying bills) and changes in health risk behavior (less exercise, sleep, and healthy eating; more smoking/vaping and drinking alcohol), controlling for both individual-level and zip code-level confounders, among 90,971 US women who completed an online survey in March-April 2020. Almost 40% of women reported one or more COVID-19-related financial stressors. Each financial stressor was significantly associated with higher odds of each type of health risk behavior change. Overall, reporting one or more financial stressors was associated with 56% higher odds (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.51, 1.60) of reporting two or more health risk behavior changes. This association was even stronger among women with no health insurance (OR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.97, 3.07). COVID-19-related economic stress is thus linked to shifts in health risk behaviors among women, which may have physical health consequences for years to come. Further, the relationship between financial hardship and health risk behavior among women may be modified by health insurance status, as a marker for broader socioeconomic context and resources. The most socioeconomically vulnerable women are likely at highest risk for long-term health effects of COVID-19 financial consequences. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps in knowledge and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and obesity in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)., METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, LILACS, and Web of Science for studies published up to April 27, 2020. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, comprising mortality and severe COVID-19. We used a standardized data extraction form to collect information from published reports of eligible studies. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using I2 statistic and funnel plots, respectively., RESULTS: Nine studies including 6577 patients were selected for evaluation. The COVID-19 patients were 59.80% male and had comorbidities such as hypertension (51.51%), diabetes (30.3%), cardiovascular disease (16.66%), lung disease (15.99%), renal disease (7.49%), cancer (5.07%), and immunosuppression (1.8%). For patients with severe complications, the overall pooled event rates were 56.2% (random; 95% CI: 35.3-75.1; p = 0.015; I2 = 71.461) for obesity, 23.6% (random; 95% CI: 17.9-30.5; p = 0.000; I2 = 87.705) for type 2 diabetes, 45.9% (random; 95% CI: 38.0-53.9; p = 0.000; I2 = 90.152) for hypertension, 20.0% (random; 95% CI: 7.9-42.0; p = 0.000; I2 = 94.577) for smoking, 21.6% (random; 95% CI: 14.1-31.4%; p = 0.000, I2 = 92.983) for lung diseases, and 20.6% (random; 95% CI: 15.2-27.5; p = 0.000, I2 = 85.735) for cardiovascular diseases., DISCUSSION: This systematic review indicated the relationship between obesity, ICU admission, severe COVID-19, and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Obese patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, smoking habit, lung disease, and/or cardiovascular disease should be cared for with increased attention.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Introduction Studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of smoking on outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but the results have been conflicting. In this meta-analysis, we systematically examined the association between smoking and mortality in COVID-19. Methods PubMed database was searched to look for relevant articles. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cohort studies or case series studies; (2) study population included individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 infection; (3) the status of smoking was reported, regardless if it was current or in the past; and (4) mortality among smokers was reported in the study or could be calculated and compared to non-smokers. Mortality rates were pooled using a random effects model. Risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were also calculated using the same model. Another meta-analysis was then performed to assess the difference in mortality between current and former smokers. Results Ten studies with a total of 11,189 patients were included. Mortality among smokers was 29.4% compared to 17.0% among non-smokers. RR was 2.07 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.69). Based on analysis of four studies (532 patients), there was no difference in mortality risk between current and former smokers (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.40). Conclusions Smoking, current or past, is associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality among current smokers was about 50% greater than former smokers, but the difference was not statistically significant. Copyright © 2020, Salah et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency and severity of general and ear nose throat (ENT)- related symptoms, especially smell and/or loss of sense of taste (STL) in COVID-19 disease, as well as to investigate the recovery process of STL., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis were given a questionnaire consisting of general questions (age, sex, date of symptoms, smoking history, concomitant diseases), questions about the most obvious symptom at presentation (one option only), the severity and frequency of symptoms (general and ENT), and STL (recovery time and degree of recovery)., RESULTS: The study population consisted of 172 patients, 18-65 years old (mean age, 37.8 +/- 12.5 years; 51.2% female; 76.2% nonsmokers). Cough (n = 30, 17.4%) and loss of sense of smell (n = 18, 10.4%) were the most obvious general and ENT symptoms, respectively. Eighty-eight patients (51.2%) reported loss of sense of smell, and 81 patients (47.1%) reported loss of sense of taste. The mean recovery times for loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were 8.02 +/- 6.41 and 8.20 +/- 7.07 days, respectively. The loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were the unique symptoms in four (4.54%) and one (1.23%) patients, respectively., CONCLUSION: STL is a common symptom in COVID-19 and may be the first and/or only symptom of this disease. In patients presenting with STL complaints, surveillance for possible COVID-19 disease and screening tests will facilitate the struggle against the disease. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - It has been reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the main cell entry proteins for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and play a critical role in causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels.

N2  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is currently a serious global issue. Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Context: Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has had effects on the various functions of the renal system. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dangerous and broadly spread pathological illness., Objective: In this review, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI., Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before May 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: "Coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" or "COVID-19" or "AKI" or "renal failure" or "nephrology"., Setting: This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia., Results: The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChRalpha7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-kappaB (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated., Conclusions: The research team concluded that the dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system could explain most of the clinical features of severe COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading all over the world since December 2019. However, medical information regarding the urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients is limited or unknown., OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men aged between 20 years and 50 years who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovered when the study was conducted were enrolled in our study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and history of hospitalization were collected and analyzed. Urine, expressed prostatic secretions (EPSs), and semen samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Semen quality and hormonal profiles were analyzed., RESULTS: Among 74 male recovered COVID-19 patients, 11 (14.9%) were asymptomatic, classified into mild type, and 31 (41.9%) were classified into moderate type. The remaining patients (32/74, 43.2%) had severe pneumonia. No critically ill recovered COVID-19 patient was recruited in our cohort. The median interval between last positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test and semen samples collection was 80 days (IQR, 64-93). The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-36; range, 21-49), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 24.40 (IQR, 22.55-27.30). Forty-five (61.6%) men were married, and 28 (38.4%) were unmarried. Fifty-three (72.6%) patients denied cigarette smoking, 18 (24.7%) were active smokers, and 2 of them were past smokers. The majority of our participants (53/74, 72.6%) did not consume alcohol. Fever occurred in most of the patients (75.3%), and 63 of them had abnormal chest CT images. Only one patient complained of scrotal discomfort during the course of COVID-19, which was ruled out orchitis by MRI (data not shown). A total of 205 samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection (74 urine samples, 70 semen samples, and 61 EPS samples). However, viral nucleic acid was not detected in body fluids from the urogenital system. In terms of hormonal profiles, the levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, and estradiol were 5.20 [4.23] mIU/mL, 3.95 [1.63] mIU/mL, 3.65 [1.19] ng/mL, and 39.48 [12.51] pg/mL, respectively. And these values were within the normal limits. The overall semen quality of recovered COVID-19 patients was above the lower reference limit released by the WHO. While compared with healthy control, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motility were significantly declined. In addition, different clinical types of COVID-19 have no significant difference in semen parameters, but total sperm count showed a descending trend. Interestingly, subjects with a longer recovery time showed worse data for sperm quality. Small sample size and lacking semen parameters before the infection are the major limitations of our study., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest cohort study with longest follow-up for urogenital evaluation comprehensively so far. Direct urogenital involvement was not found in the recovered COVID-19 male patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was undetectable in the urogenital secretions, and semen quality declined slightly, while hormonal profiles remained normal. Moreover, patients with a long time (>=90 days) since recovery had lower total sperm count. Great attention and further study should be conducted and follow-up on the reproductive function in the following months.

N2  - The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral health, including tobacco use, are not fully known. The current study sought to measure the perceived impact of COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York on smokers enrolled in four smoking cessation trials between March 2020 and July 2020. The survey collected quantitative data regarding life changes due to COVID-19, health/exposure status, and the impact on their cessation attempt (e.g., motivation to quit, change in triggers). The questionnaire collected qualitative data to better understand how such changes could explain changes in smoking behavior. Of the 42 participants surveyed, approximately half indicated that COVID-19 changed their motivation and ability to quit or remain quit. Among those who reported that it was easier to quit following the stay-at-home orders (n = 24), most attributed this to concerns regarding the severity of COVID-19 among smokers. Among those who reported more difficulty quitting (n = 15), most attributed this to their increased stress due to the pandemic and the inability to access activities, places, or people that could help them manage triggers. Given public health warnings of continued surges in COVID-19, these data provide insight into who may benefit from further smoking cessation support should existing restrictions or new stay-at-home orders be enacted.

N2  - AIMS: To assess clinical and prognosis differences in patients with Covid-19 and STEMI., METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a nationwide registry of consecutive patients managed within 42 specific STEMI-care networks, we compared patient and procedure characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts, according to whether they had Covid-19. Among 1010 consecutive STEMI patients, 91 were identified as Covid-19 (10.9%). With the exception of smoking status (more frequent in non-Covid-19) and previous coronary artery disease (more frequent in Covid-19), clinical characteristics were similar between groups, but Covid-19 patients had more heart failure on arrival (31.9% vs 18.4%, p=0.002). Mechanical thrombectomy (44% vs 33.5%, p=0.046) and IIbIIIa inhibitors administration (20.9% vs 11.2%, p=0.007) were more frequent in Covid-19 patients, who had an increased in-hospital mortality (23.1% vs 5.7%, p<0.0001), that remained consistent after adjustment for age, sex, Killip class and ischemic time: OR (95% CI) = 4.85 (2.04-11.51); p<0.001. Covid-19 patients had an increase of stent thrombosis (3.3% vs 0.8%, p=0.020) and cardiogenic shock development after PCI (9.9 % vs 3.8%, p=0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a significant increase in in-hospital, stent thrombosis and cardiogenic shock development after PCI in patients with STEMI and Covid-19 in comparison with contemporaneous non-Covid-19 STEMI patients.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus associated with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causing a pandemic worldwide in 2020. There are other noninfectious diseases that can present exactly as COVID-19, and the management and approach are completely different, hence the importance of understanding and having a wide differential in patients presenting with similar characteristics. Case Report. A 23-year-old male, with a history of childhood asthma, presented to the Emergency Department in a hospital in south Florida in the USA with complaints of a 2-day duration of subjective fever, chills, dry cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. His vital signs were blood pressure 135/65 mmHg, temperature 39degreeC, pulse 134 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and saturation of oxygen 96% in room air. Laboratory analysis was significant for white blood cells 15.3 x 103/muL, ALT 69 U/L, AST 66 U/L, ferritin 375.6 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 27.70 mg/dL, and procalcitonin 1.43 ng/mL. A respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) and a SARS-CoV-2 test were both negative. The patient was given empiric antibiotic treatment and hydroxychloroquine. Two more tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and the patient reported that he smoked marijuana through an e-cigarette. The patient was started on high-dose steroids, and symptoms improved., Conclusion: COVID-19 is an emergent lung disease that is affecting the population worldwide; many other noninfectious diseases can mimic its presentations and laboratory characteristics; the importance of having a broad differential diagnosis especially in causing confusion during pandemic times is valuable in the management of patients with such presentations, such as EVALI, and glucocorticoids will be indicated in this circumstances.

T1  - Alteration, Reduction and Taste Loss: Main Causes and Potential Implications on Dietary Habits.
A1  - Risso, Davide

A1  - Morini, Gabriella
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Our sense of taste arises from the sensory information generated after compounds in the oral cavity and oropharynx activate taste receptor cells situated on taste buds. This produces the perception of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or umami stimuli, depending on the chemical nature of the tastant. Taste impairments (dysgeusia) are alterations of this normal gustatory functioning that may result in complete taste losses (ageusia), partial reductions (hypogeusia), or over-acuteness of the sense of taste (hypergeusia). Taste impairments are not life-threatening conditions, but they can cause sufficient discomfort and lead to appetite loss and changes in eating habits, with possible effects on health. Determinants of such alterations are multiple and consist of both genetic and environmental factors, including aging, exposure to chemicals, drugs, trauma, high alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, poor oral health, malnutrition, and viral upper respiratory infections including influenza. Disturbances or loss of smell, taste, and chemesthesis have also emerged as predominant neurological symptoms of infection by the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as by previous both endemic and pandemic coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV. This review is focused on the main causes of alteration, reduction, and loss of taste and their potential repercussion on dietary habits and health, with a special focus on the recently developed hypotheses regarding the mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 might alter taste perception.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Developing insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of critical importance to overcome the global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2., FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19 x 10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04 x 10-12). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32 x 10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples., INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease., FUNDING: The Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the British Heart Foundation and UK Research and Innovation.

T1  - Nutritional status of micronutrients as a possible and modifiable risk factor for COVID-19: a UK perspective.
A1  - Richardson, David P
A1  - Lovegrove, Julie A
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Recent scientific evidence has indicated that the elderly have increased risk of COVID-19 infections, with over 70s and 80s being hardest hit - especially residents of care homes and in clinical settings, ethnic minorities, people who work indoors and those who are overweight and obese. Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection. Frequent handwashing and social distancing will be critical to reduce transmission.

N2  - In the summer of 2019, there was a rise in clusters of adolescents and young adults in the United States reporting to emergency departments with acute respiratory distress related to use of e-cigarette (electronic cigarette) or vaping. The number of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury continued to rise through the summer before peaking in September 2019. Through the efforts of state and federal public health agencies, officials were able to define the condition, identify the relationship of the respiratory injury to tetrahydrocannabinol-containing products, and stem the rise in new cases. In this report, we present a comprehensive review of the clinical characteristics and features of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury and guidelines for patient care and management to inform and navigate clinicians who may encounter these patients in their clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (>= 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age >= 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The mental health status caused by major epidemics is serious and lasting. At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak., METHODS: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted., RESULTS: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25., LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, people's mental state is affected by the geographical and temporal distributions. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Various comorbidities represent risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The impact of smoking on COVID-19 severity has been previously reported in several meta-analyses limited by small sample sizes and poor methodology. We aimed to rigorously and definitively quantify the effects of smoking on COVID-19 severity. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched between 1 December 2019 and 2 June 2020. Studies reporting smoking status of hospitalized patients with different severities of disease and/or at least one clinical endpoint of interest (disease progression, intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality) were included. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. This study was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42020180920. We analyzed 47 eligible studies reporting on 32 849 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with 8417 (25.6%) reporting a smoking history, comprising 1501 current smokers, 5676 former smokers, and 1240 unspecified smokers. Current smokers had an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (risk ratios [RR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-2.85; P = .012), and severe or critical COVID-19 (RR: 1.98; CI: 1.16-3.38; P = .012). Patients with a smoking history had a significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 (RR: 1.31; CI: 1.12-1.54; P = .001), severe or critical COVID-19 (RR: 1.35; CI: 1.19-1.53; P < .0001), in-hospital mortality (RR: 1.26; CI: 1.20-1.32; P < .0001), disease progression (RR: 2.18; CI: 1.06-4.49; P = .035), and need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.20; CI: 1.01-1.42; P = .043). Patients with any smoking history are vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and worse in-hospital outcomes. In the absence of current targeted therapies, preventative, and supportive strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in current and former smokers are crucial. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Large gatherings are associated with the spread of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19); however, transmission dynamics are not well understood. We investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases in returning Australian residents who attended wedding events in Bali, Indonesia, during 15- 21 March 2020. Attendees participated in various social events and were in close proximity, providing multiple opportunities for transmission., Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 41 attendees, of whom 17 participated in a structured interview that included history of illness, risk exposures and event attendance. We obtained data for the remaining 24 participants through corroborative histories and public health unit case investigations., Results: COVID-19 was identified in 56% of attendees (23/41), with illness onset between 21 March and 2 April 2020. One secondary case was identified in a household contact of an attendee. The median age of cases was 31 years (range 3-64). One case was hospitalised and did not require critical care. There were no deaths. No cases occurred among six attendees who left prior to the actual wedding day. Guests attended multiple events and participated in high-risk transmission behaviours such as shaking hands, kissing, dancing, sharing drinks and sharing shisha (water pipes). Attack rates ranged from 64% to 87% for different exposures. We could not identify a single risk exposure that accounted for all cases; it is therefore likely there were multiple episodes of transmission., Conclusion: Our investigation identified a high attack rate of COVID-19 among a cohort of wedding event attendees. Attendees engaged in close physical contact, shared drinks and shisha, and were in close proximity during the wedding events, which may have contributed to the high attack rate. This outbreak highlights the significant role social events can play in transmission of COVID-19 and underscores why it is important to limit gatherings and close physical contact to control the spread of the virus.

T1  - Exploring Diseases/Traits and Blood Proteins Causally Related to Expression of ACE2, the Putative Receptor of SARS-CoV-2: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis Highlights Tentative Relevance of Diabetes-Related Traits.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has become a major public health problem. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant., RESULTS: The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest genome-wide association studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to date (N = 898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (P = 2.91E-03; MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; P < 0.05) with ACE2 expression were observed across multiple diabetes data sets and analytic methods for T1DM, T2DM, and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancer, lung cancer, asthma, smoking, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at false discovery rate <0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning. Further studies are required to verify our findings.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report a case of branch retinal artery occlusion associated with paracentral acute middle maculopathy on spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) presumably related to heavy cannabis consumption., METHODS: Retrospective case report. SD-OCT, fluorescein angiography and OCT angiography were performed., RESULTS: A 21-year-old healthy man described the acute onset of superior visual field loss in his right eye. He admitted smoking approximately 15 grams daily of cannabis for several weeks during COVID-19 confinement. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye showed inferotemporal retinal whitening. SD-OCT illustrated evidence of the ischemic cascade with diffuse hyperreflectivity of the inner and middle retinal layers within the central region of the retinal infarct and paracentral acute middle maculopathy at the border of the infarct. Optical coherence tomography angiography demonstrated predominant flow signal loss at the level of the deep retinal capillary plexus. Fluorescein angiography and complete systemic workup were unremarkable., CONCLUSION: Branch retinal artery occlusion and paracentral acute middle maculopathy may be related to heavy cannabis use as the result of transient arterial vasospasm.

T1  - Malaysia's third COVID-19 wave - a paradigm shift required.
A1  - Rampal, L
A1  - Liew, B S
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Malaysia on the 25 January 2020. By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020. The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups. There is also a need to expedite the tabling of Tobacco Control Bill in coming parliament session which is long overdue. H.E. the King of Malaysia has called on all Malaysians to put aside political, racial and religious differences and show the spirit of loyalty, humanitarianism and steadfastness in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutic and public health strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality-effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multimodal analytical approach to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility and clinical outcome associated with infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations., RESULTS: 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (+/-10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - In this retrospective study we analyze and compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without cancer history who were infected with novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Medical records were reviewed and a comparative analysis of 53 cancer and 135 non-cancer patients with COVID-19 were summarized. Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients with and without cancer was 71.5 and 61.6 years, respectively. Patients aged 60 years and above were 86.8% and 60.7% in cancer and non-cancer groups, respectively. A high proportion of cases were seen in African Americans 73.6% (with cancer) and 75.6% (without cancer) followed by Hispanic patients. Male and female patients had a high percentage of prostate (39.3%) and breast (32%) cancer respectively. Prostate cancer (18.9%) and myeloma (11.3%) were common among solid and hematological cancers respectively. Hypertension and smoking were prevalent among cancer (83% and 41.5%) compared to non-cancer (67.4% and 9.6%) patients. The common symptoms in cancer patients were dyspnea (64.2%) followed by fever and cough (50.9%) compared to fever (68.1%) and cough (66.7%) in non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had higher levels of lactic acidosis, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase than non-cancer patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions : Rapid clinical deterioration was seen in cancer patients who were aged 60 years and above. Higher mortality was seen in this subgroup, especially when they had associated hypertension and elevated levels of CRP and LDH.

N2  - Background: Cardiometabolic morbidity and medications, specifically Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), have been linked with adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aims to investigate, factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in hospital for 1,436 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the cohort. Methods: We studied 7,099 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19 in hospital. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between (1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative tested participants; and (2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n = 494,838). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, Black, Asian, and Minority ethnic (BAME) ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI were independently associated with a positive result. BAME ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remaining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalization rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, BAME ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalization, without specificity for COVID-19. ACE/ARB use did not associate with COVID-19 status.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We examined whether the greater severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amongst men and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals is explained by cardiometabolic, socio-economic or behavioural factors., METHODS: We studied 4510 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 (positive, n = 1326). Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of (1) cardiometabolic factors [diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking and body mass index (BMI)]; (2) 25(OH)-vitamin D; (3) poor diet; (4) Townsend deprivation score; (5) housing (home type, overcrowding) or (6) behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status., RESULTS: There was over-representation of men and BAME ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. BAME individuals had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and in flats/apartments. Male sex, BAME ethnicity, higher BMI, higher Townsend deprivation score and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex/ethnicity associations., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 was not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels or socio-economic factors. Factors which underlie ethnic differences in COVID-19 may not be easily captured, and so investigation of alternative biological and genetic susceptibilities as well as more comprehensive assessment of the complex economic, social and behavioural differences should be prioritised.

N2  - Despite a growing body of research examining correlates and consequences of COVID-19, few findings have been published among military veterans. This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables. Findings highlight the importance of assessing for lifetime tobacco use among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the relative importance of lifetime tobacco use as a risk factor for increased mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the personal, professional and social life of Australians with some people more impacted than others., OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia., METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among residents in Australia, including patients, frontline health and other essential service workers, and community members during June 2020. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10); level of fear was assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S); and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the extent of psychological distress, level of fear and coping strategies while adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: Among 587 participants, the majority (391, 73.2%) were 30-59 years old and female (363, 61.8%). More than half (349, 59.5%) were born outside Australia and two-third (418, 71.5%) completed at least a Bachelor's degree. The majority (401, 71.5%) had a source of income, 243 (42.3%) self-identified as a frontline worker, and 335 (58.9%) reported financial impact due to COVID-19. Comorbidities such as pre-existing mental health conditions (AOR 3.13, 95% CIs 1.12-8.75), increased smoking (8.66, 1.08-69.1) and alcohol drinking (2.39, 1.05-5.47) over the last four weeks, high levels of fear (2.93, 1.83-4.67) and being female (1.74, 1.15-2.65) were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Perceived distress due to change of employment status (4.14, 1.39-12.4), alcohol drinking (3.64, 1.54-8.58), providing care to known or suspected cases (3.64, 1.54-8.58), being female (1.56, 1.00-2.45), being 30-59 years old (2.29, 1.21-4.35) and having medium to high levels of psychological distress (2.90, 1.82-5.62) were associated with a higher level of fear; while healthcare service use in the last four weeks was associated with medium to high resilience., CONCLUSIONS: This study identified individuals who were at higher risk of distress and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic specifically in the State of Victoria, Australia. Specific interventions to support the mental wellbeing of these individuals should be considered in addition to the existing resources within primary healthcare settings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We intend to identify some probable risk factors that are responsible for the severity of COVID-19 using a meta-analysis., METHODS: The literature exploration lasted up to 18 April 2020 and through PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Cochrane Library we have identified 10 pertinent publications. To paraphrase the outcomes of autonomous researches, we have performed a random-effect meta-analysis., RESULTS: A total of 2272 patients' information was extracted from the selected literature. We have found gender (male) (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.54), hypertension (RR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.04), diabetes (RR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.98), fatigue or myalgia (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35), and smoking history (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.35) are potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. We found fever (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.22), cough (1.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.30) and diarrhoea (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.40) as insignificant risk factors for COVID-19 severity., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research may be beneficial to identify patients with higher risks to provide additional medical attention from the very beginning of the treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19., METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status., RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the days of the reorganization of healthcare systems due to SARS-Cov2 pandemic, patients suffering from chronic diseases are being often neglected. The aim of our study was to examine the attitudes and behaviors of patient suffering from relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis using disease-modifying drugs in Montenegro in relation to the current pandemic., METHODS: The research was conducted through an online-generated questionnaire during the peak of the pandemic., RESULTS: There is a high level of concern about COVID-19 (3.22+/-1.23), especially about safety behavior intensification (3.80+/-1.29). Possibility of relapse during pandemic was considered as moderate (2.06+/-1.42), but relapse symptoms would be reported by the majority of subjects (1.55+/-1.23). Our unemployed patients statistically more often reported that they had more frequent mood changes, but also that they felt more energy loss. Surprisingly, there was no difference among the subjects according to smoking status. According therapy groups there was significant difference between the groups regarding some variables: patients using ocrelizumab are most concerned about COVID-19; patients using interferon beta 1a i.m. statistically more often have frequent changes in their mood, memory problems, poor appetite, feeling of nausea or upset stomach and patients on fingolimod have bigger afraid of coming to regular visits., CONCLUSION: Our patients showed concern about their disease future status in the current epidemic era, but also showed a high degree of trust in physicians and the overall health system.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Covid-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global and integrated response of all national medical and healthcare systems. Covid-19 exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus., METHODS: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio's Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool., RESULTS: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine., CONCLUSIONS: We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The impact of race and socioeconomic status on clinical outcomes has not been quantified in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan., PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction., MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment., KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531-56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850-85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income ($10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89, 0.96), p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage, which is closely associated with race, is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage should be used to inform policies that aim to reduce COVID-19 disparities in the Black community.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To recognise clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia and its differences from influenza pneumonia., METHODS: 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia., RESULTS: The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic 'bat wing sign'. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values., CONCLUSION: There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned into a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological research has shown that sex is associated with the severity of COVID-19, but the underlying mechanism of sex predisposition remains poorly understood. We aim to study the gendered differences in inflammation reaction, and the association with severity and mortality of COVID-19., METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 548 COVID-19 inpatients from Tongji Hospital from 26 January to 5 February 2020, and followed up to 3 March 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical features, and inflammatory indexes were collected and compared between males and females. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify the gendered effect on mortality of COVID-19 after adjusting for age, comorbidity, and smoking history. The multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction., RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs 10.4%), with an hazard ratio of 1.923 (95% confidence interval, 1.181-3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID-19 patients. Excess inflammation reaction was related to severity of COVID-19. Male patients had greater inflammation reaction, with higher levels of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, lactose dehydrogenase, ferritin, and hyper-sensitive C-reactive protein, but a lower lymphocyte count than females adjusted by age and comorbidity., CONCLUSIONS: Sex, age, and comorbidity are critical risk factors for mortality of COVID-19. Excess innate immunity and proinflammation activity, and deficiency in adaptive immunity response promote males, especially elder males, to develop a cytokine storm, causing potential acute respiratory distressed syndrome, multiple organ failure and decease.

N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, employs two key host proteins to gain entry and replicate within cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2 was first characterized as an androgen-regulated gene in the prostate. Supporting a role for sex hormones, males relative to females are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of mortality and morbidity. Several studies, including one employing a large epidemiological cohort, suggested that blocking androgen signaling is protective against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that androgens regulate the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and androgen receptor (AR) in subsets of lung epithelial cells. AR levels are markedly elevated in males relative to females greater than 70 y of age. In males greater than 70 y old, smoking was associated with elevated levels of AR and ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. Transcriptional repression of the AR enhanceosome with AR or bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Taken together, these studies support further investigation of transcriptional inhibition of critical host factors in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s).

N1  - Update in (UIN)
N2  - Most demographic studies are now associating current smoking status with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality from the disease but there remain many questions about how direct cigarette smoke exposure affects SARS-CoV-2 airway cell infection. We directly exposed mucociliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term cigarette smoke and infected them with live SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after cigarette smoke exposure as well as an increased number of apoptotic cells. Cigarette smoke exposure alone caused airway injury that resulted in an increased number of ABSCs, which proliferate to repair the airway. But we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or the combination of exposure to cigarette smoke and SARS-CoV-2 did not induce ABSC proliferation. We set out to examine the underlying mechanism governing the increased susceptibility of cigarette smoke exposed ALI to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell profiling of the cultures showed that infected airway cells displayed a global reduction in gene expression across all airway cell types. Interestingly, interferon response genes were induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells in the ALI cultures but smoking exposure together with SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced the interferon response. Treatment of cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures with Interferon beta-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting that the lack of interferon response in the cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures allows for more severe viral infection and cell death. In summary, our data show that acute smoke exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke.

N2  - Current smoking is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, but it is not clear how cigarette smoke (CS) exposure affects SARS-CoV-2 airway cell infection. We directly exposed air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term CS and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack of ABSC proliferation. Single-cell profiling of the cultures showed that the normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection. Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with interferon beta-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To date, 750 000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae., METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged >=18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression., FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40.0 (30.0 to 53.0). 1397 (66.9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87.5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64.0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 12.0) and 1481 (70.9%) were given propofol for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 11.0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81.6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10.0 days (6.0 to 15.0) and 1147 (54.9%) were delirious for a median of 3.0 days (2.0 to 6.0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p<=0.04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0.0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5.0 days (0.0 to 14.0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0.01). 601 (28.8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU., INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19., FUNDING: None., TRANSLATIONS: For the French and Spanish translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges for healthcare systems across the world. The disease seems to infect men and women in equal numbers, though trends suggest that men have greater morbidity. This has been attributed to differences in immunological response, expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), prevalence of comorbidities, and health-related behaviours, such as smoking. However, this cannot be taken to mean that women are somehow protected. Advanced age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have emerged as the leading contributors to increased morbidity and mortality from the disease. Women with diabetes form a vulnerable group as they often receive suboptimal diabetes care and support, even though they have a high burden of comorbidities and complications. While there are challenges in healthcare delivery during the pandemic, cardiometabolic care cannot be compromised, which calls for exploring new avenues of healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine. Pregnant women with diabetes should continue to receive quality care for optimal outcomes, and the psychological health of women also needs special consideration. The management of hyperglycaemia during COVID-19 infection is important to reduce morbidity and mortality from the infection. The gendered impact of outbreaks and quarantine goes beyond biomedical and psychological aspects, and the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic is likely to affect the long-term care of women with diabetes, which creates an urgent need to create effective policies and interventions to promote optimal care in this vulnerable group.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This protocol describes an observational study which set out to assess whether frailty and/or multimorbidity correlates with short-term and medium-term outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a European, multicentre setting., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Over a 3-month period we aim to recruit a minimum of 500 patients across 10 hospital sites, collecting baseline data including: patient demographics; presence of comorbidities; relevant blood tests on admission; prescription of ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/immunosuppressants; smoking status; Clinical Frailty Score (CFS); length of hospital stay; mortality and readmission. All patients receiving inpatient hospital care >18 years who receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible for inclusion. Long-term follow-up at 6 and 12 months is planned. This will assess frailty, quality of life and medical complications.Our primary analysis will be short-term and long-term mortality by CFS, adjusted for age (18-64, 65-80 and >80) and gender. We will carry out a secondary analysis of the primary outcome by including additional clinical mediators which are determined statistically important using a likelihood ratio test. All analyses will be presented as crude and adjusted HR and OR with associated 95% CIs and p values., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been registered, reviewed and approved by the following: Health Research Authority (20/HRA1898); Ethics Committee of Hospital Policlinico Modena, Italy (369/2020/OSS/AOUMO); Health and Care Research Permissions Service, Wales; and NHS Research Scotland Permissions Co-ordinating Centre, Scotland. All participating units obtained approval from their local Research and Development department consistent with the guidance from their relevant national organisation.Data will be reported as a whole cohort. This project will be submitted for presentation at a national or international surgical and geriatric conference. Manuscript(s) will be prepared following the close of the project.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking with outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Central Database. A composite of poor outcome, mortality, severe COVID-19, the need for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) and disease progression were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Data on 4603 patients were pooled from 21 studies. COPD was associated with an increased risk for composite poor outcome (OR 5.01, 95%CI 3.06-8.22; P < 0.001; I2 0%), mortality (OR 4.36, 95%CI 1.45-13.10; P = 0.009; I2 0%), severe COVID-19 (OR 4.62, 95%CI 2.49-8.56; P < 0.001; I2 0%), ICU care (OR 8.33, 95%CI 1.27-54.56; P = 0.03; I2 0%), and disease progression (OR 8.42, 95%CI 1.60-44.27; P = 0.01; I2 0%). Smoking was found to increase the risk of composite poor outcome (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.16-2.00; P = 0.005; I2 12%), and subgroup analysis showed that smoking was significant for increased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.17-2.34; P = 0.004; I2 11%). Current smokers were at higher risk of composite poor outcomes (OR 1.58, 95%CI 1.10-2.27; P = 0.01; I2 0%) than former/non-smokers. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that COPD and smoking were associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

T1  - A Call for Preventive Medicine Attention for Indonesian Physicians.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The year of 2020 teaches us to prevent is always better than to cure. It is an old phrase that is being used for decades, but it is never been implemented cordially by our society nowadays. Covid-19 is a good lesson that reminds us to carefully prevent the spread of coronavirus which is now a pandemic worldwide. People now wash their hands more often and clean, wear a mask everywhere - everytime, do physical distancing, do healthy lifestyle such as physical activity, healthy diet, and consume multivitamins. They obey the cough and sneeze etiquette. Prevention awareness is never been such popular like todays.For internal medicine specialist, the role for prevention is very broad. Besides we still have a role in primary prevention, we can take our part in both secondary and (of course) tertiary prevention. Primary prevention can be defined as an action not allow a disease to occur, for examples vaccination (for internal medicine specialist more specific as adult vaccination), smoking cessation, physical activity (exercise) and healthy diet. Health promotion and prevention is the core of primary prevention. Secondary prevention aims to detect the disease as early as possible, in at risk population, such as mammography for breast cancer, swab test for Covid-19, colonoscopy for colon cancer in high risk patients. Last, tertiary prevention propose to hamper the progress of clinical disease and prevent more severe complications of the disease, for examples cardiac rehabilitation, or medications for prevent chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes or hypertension. It is overlapping the curative or treatment strategies as it is states "to cure is to prevent". In 2020, in which each underlying conditions require effective treatment and each disease should be prevented. We are now facing the era of preventive medicine. As an internal medicine specialist, we need to put in mind a philosophy of prevention in every of our action towards patient's care and services.

N2  - In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), higher morbidity and mortality are associated with age, male gender, and comorbidities, such as chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular pathologies, hypertension, kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. All of the above conditions are characterized by increased sympathetic discharge, which may exert significant detrimental effects on COVID-19 patients, through actions on the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, metabolism, and/or immune system. Furthermore, COVID-19 may also increase sympathetic discharge, through changes in blood gases (chronic intermittent hypoxia, hyperpnea), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)1/ACE2 imbalance, immune/inflammatory factors, or emotional distress. Nevertheless, the potential role of the sympathetic nervous system has not yet been considered in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. In our opinion, sympathetic overactivation could represent a so-far undervalued mechanism for a vicious circle between COVID-19 and comorbidities.

N2  - In view of a recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a high demand for production of a vaccine to prevent this disease. Recent studies indicate that SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spike protein (S protein) and its truncated fragments are considered the best candidates for generation of the recombinant vaccine. Toward the development of a safe, effective, and inexpensive vaccine candidate, we have expressed the N-terminal fragment of SARS-CoV S protein (S1) in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants. Incorporation of the S1 fragment into plant genomes as well as its transcription was confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analyses. High levels of expression of recombinant S1 protein were observed in several transgenic lines by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Plant-derived antigen was evaluated to induce the systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice. Mice showed significantly increased levels of SARS-CoV-specific IgA after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing S1 protein. Sera of mice parenterally primed with tobacco-derived S1 protein revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-specific IgG as detected by Western blot and ELISA analysis.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The ACE2 receptor is, so far, the best-known host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, but another essential element, the TMPRSS2 protease, has recently been identified. Here, we have analysed TMPRSS2 expression data in the lung correlating them with age, sex, diabetes, smoking habits, exposure to pollutant and other stimuli, in order to highlight which factors might alter TMPRSS2 expression, and thus impact the susceptibility to infection and COVID-19 prognosis. Moreover, we reported TMPRSS2 polymorphisms affecting its expression and suggested the ethnic groups more prone to COVID-19. Finally, we also highlighted a gender-specific co-expression between TMPRSS2 and other genes related to SARS-CoV-2 entry, maybe explaining the higher observed susceptibility of infection in men. Our results could be useful in designing potential prevention and treatment strategies regarding the COVID-19.

N2  - Periodontal disease (PD) comprises a group of diseases involving inflammatory aspects of the host and dysbiotic events that affect periodontal tissues and could have systemic implications. Diverse factors and comorbidities have been closely associated with PD such as diabetes, obesity, aging, hypertension, and so on; although, underlying mechanisms or causal associations have not been established completely. Interestingly, these same factors have been widely associated with progression or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Since inflammatory and dysbiotic factors as well as comorbidities affect systemic health, it is possible that periodontal status indicates the risk of complication of COVID-19. However, assessment of oral health history including periodontal status in COVID-19 patients has not been reported. Knowing PD is associated with severe COVID-19 could help identify risk groups and establish pertinent recommendations. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The extreme social circumstances caused by declared COVID-19 pandemic deeply intervene people's everyday life and should not be neglected but seen through the view of social reality pinpointing the 'ordinary' people. In this article, authors explored basic segments of everyday and their subjective perception to what extent sleeping habits, physical inactivity, physical activity, nutritional habits and smoking have changed., METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo*, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30-40 days after World Health Organization declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from 15 April to 3 May 2020., RESULTS: The results have shown 30 min longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement., CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period. Because of possible risk to population's health (especially of countries such as Italy and Spain with serious threat and more stringent measures), findings enable development of recommendations for maintaining healthy lifestyle habits with minimal negative health consequences in similar pandemic circumstances.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused a change in our society and put health systems in crisis worldwide. Different risk factors and comorbidities have been found that increase the risk of mortality when acquiring this infection. The use of alternative devices to the cigarette like the electronic cigarettes, the vapers have been studied widely and generators of great controversy since it has been discovered that they also produce different pulmonary affections. When developing the SARS-CoV2 infection, different theories have been generated about the greater predisposition to a worse prognosis of people who use electronic cigarettes; however, the information on this continues in discovery. A group of experts made up of oncologists, infectologists, pulmonologists, and epidemiologists met to review the literature and then generate theories about the impact of electronic cigarettes on SARS-CoV2 infection.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the experience of people with long-term respiratory conditions regarding the impact of measures to reduce risk of COVID-19., DESIGN: Analysis of data (n=9515) from the Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation partnership COVID-19 survey collected online between 1 and 8 April 2020., SETTING: Community., PARTICIPANTS: 9515 people with self-reported long-term respiratory conditions. 81% female, age ranges from <=17 years to 80 years and above, from all nations of the UK. Long-term respiratory conditions reported included asthma (83%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%) and 'other' (<1%) (eg, lung cancer and pulmonary endometriosis)., OUTCOME MEASURES: Study responses related to impacts on key elements of healthcare, as well as practical, psychological and social consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures., RESULTS: 45% reported disruptions to care, including cancellations of appointments, investigations, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment and monitoring. Other practical impacts such as difficulty accessing healthcare services for other issues and getting basic necessities such as food were also common. 36% did not use online prescriptions, and 54% had not accessed online inhaler technique videos. Psychosocial impacts including anxiety, loneliness and concerns about personal health and family were prevalent. 81% reported engaging in physical activity. Among the 11% who were smokers, 48% reported they were planning to quit smoking because of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and related social distancing measures are having profound impacts on people with chronic respiratory conditions. Urgent adaptation and signposting of services is required to mitigate the negative health consequences of the COVID-19 response for this group. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify how best to provide smoking cessation advice and support during the Covid-19 pandemic. Preferences were assessed in relation to: (i) specific forms of tobacco cessation support (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and various counseling formats); (ii) information sources (eg, government officials, doctors); and (iii) channels via which to receive relevant information (eg, television, social media)., METHODS: An online survey was administered to adults who smoke tobacco in Australia (n = 604) and the UK (n = 600). Descriptive analyses were conducted to identify levels of interest in cessation support and information provision. Differences in responses according to demographic characteristics and smoking history were assessed., RESULTS: Around half of the respondents were interested in receiving personal counseling and/or participating in a text support program over the next month. By far the most popular delivery mechanism for personal counseling was email. Three-quarters of the sample expressed an interest in receiving free, home-delivered NRT. The most popular information sources nominated by respondents seeking more information about smokers' Covid-related risks were government departments and their doctor/general practitioner. Television and online news sources were the most preferred information dissemination channels., CONCLUSIONS: The substantial levels of interest expressed in accessing various forms of cessation assistance within the next month suggest that Covid-19 may be increasing receptiveness to quitting. The strong interest in free, home-delivered NRT indicates that this may be a useful mechanism for facilitating quit attempts during the pandemic.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak may motivate smokers to attempt to stop in greater numbers. However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps., OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free., METHODS: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted., RESULTS: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Calculation of Bayes factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favored the null hypothesis compared with large associations (for level, BF=0.25; for slope, BF=0.26) but were insensitive to the detection of small associations (for level, BF=0.78; for slope, BF=1.35)., CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app. Findings on the association of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a small step change or increasing trend were inconclusive.

N2  - Introduction: Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and age have been pointed at as factors that influence on the progression of COVID-19; however, evidence for other conditions is inconclusive., Objective: To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression., Method: Data on >= 20-year-old confirmed cases (n = 159,017) were analyzed. Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables., Results: Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying. The risk for COVID-19 severity was lower as age was more advanced. Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID-19., Conclusion: In the Mexican population, the risk of COVID-19 progression associated with comorbidities was higher in young adults.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lockdown due to COVID-19 influenced food habits and lifestyles with potential negative health impact. This study aims to identify patterns of change in eating habits and physical activity during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain and to identify associations with sociodemographic factors and usual habits., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1155 adults recruited online to answer a 10-section questionnaire. The protocol assessed usual diet by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, usual physical activity (PA) and supplement use, dietary changes, sedentary time, PA, exposure to sunlight, sleep quality, and smoking during confinement. Patterns of dietary change were identified by factor analysis. Factor scores were included in cluster analysis together with change in PA., RESULTS: Six patterns of dietary change were identified that together with PA changes during lockdown defined three clusters of lifestyle change: a cluster less active, a more active cluster, and a third cluster as active as usual. People who were usually less active were more likely to be classified in the cluster that increased physical activity in confinement. Scores of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style dietary pattern were higher in this group. Conclusions: Different patterns of change in lifestyles in confinement suggest the need to tailor support and advice to different population groups.

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted worldwide, which contributed to various psychological problems (such as fear, depression, and anxiety) among the general population in China. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms among Chinese adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Chinese adults was conducted during 17-29 February 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Results: A total of 3,399 respondents were included in the analysis. It was observed that 14.2% (481/3,399) of the participants were screened positive for depressive symptoms. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age (OR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99), smoking (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.10-2.26), self-rated health (good: OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37-0.66; fairly: OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.80), having greater support scores (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), knowledge about the main symptom of COVID-19 (very clearly: OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.79; relatively clearly: OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.79), and staying in Wuhan within 3 months before the outbreak of epidemic (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34-2.38) were associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion:  A considerable proportion of the general population in China had depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Routine screening and targeted interventions for depression are needed among high-risk depressed individuals during the COVID-19 epidemic. Copyright © 2020 Peng, Lai, Du, Li, Tian and Gan.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate whether healthy behaviours determine the adoption of individual protective measures to fight COVID-19. The data were obtained from the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative, a telephone survey conducted among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), which includes a national sample representative of the population aged 50 years or older. The outcomes evaluated were three protective measures (not having left home in the past week, wearing a mask when leaving home, and sanitizing hands when returning home), and the explanatory variables were health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and physical activity). The associations were evaluated by logistic models, considering adjustments for potential confounding factors. A total of 5,827 individuals participated in the analysis; 32.2% did not leave home in the last week, and among those who left home, 97.5% used a face mask, and 97.3% sanitized their hands when they returned home. The practice of physical activity at the recommended levels was associated with a lower chance of not leaving home in the previous week. Ex-smokers were more likely to use a mask, and those who practised physical activity were less likely to adopt this protective measure. Individuals with low-risk alcohol consumption had a higher chance of sanitizing their hands. Actions aimed at increasing the adoption of protective measures to fight the new coronavirus should consider the existence of vulnerable groups, which can be identified by the distribution of other health behaviours in the population.

N2  - PURPOSE: There are growing signs that the COVID-19 virus has started to spread to rural areas and can impact the rural health care system that is already stretched and lacks resources. To aid in the legislative decision process and proper channelizing of resources, we estimated and compared the county-level change in prevalence rates of COVID-19 by rural-urban status over 3 weeks. Additionally, we identified hotspots based on estimated prevalence rates., METHODS: We used crowdsourced data on COVID-19 and linked them to county-level demographics, smoking rates, and chronic diseases. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in R-studio. We mapped the estimated prevalence rates using ArcGIS 10.8, and identified hotspots using Gettis-Ord local statistics., FINDINGS: In the rural counties, the mean prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 3.6 per 100,000 population to 43.6 per 100,000 within 3 weeks from April 3 to April 22, 2020. In the urban counties, the median prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 10.1 per 100,000 population to 107.6 per 100,000 within the same period. The COVID-19 adjusted prevalence rates in rural counties were substantially elevated in counties with higher black populations, smoking rates, and obesity rates. Counties with high rates of people aged 25-49 years had increased COVID-19 prevalence rates., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a rapid spread of COVID-19 across urban and rural areas in 21 days. Studies based on quality data are needed to explain further the role of social determinants of health on COVID-19 prevalence. Copyright © 2020 National Rural Health Association.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Cigarette smoking is one of the main preventable causes of cancers globally. At this time of global emergency, mental health professionals all over the world are joining hands with the public health and other healthcare communities to focus on acute measures to save lives from COVID-19. This has been particularly challenging in mental health hospital settings where numerous additional factors need to be considered, including difficulties of implementing social distancing, potential impacts of social isolation, increased stress levels and implications of all this on smoking. In this article, we will briefly discuss the prevalence of smoking in mental health patients, especially in those in mental health hospital settings and also what is the possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic in these people. Then we will go through the main reasons as to why encouraging smoking cessation in mental health patients is so important and measures we can take for supporting mental health patients quit smoking even during COVID-19 times. The smoking cessation interventions have a direct bearing on preventing future cancers and achieving smoking cessation among cancer patients in this already disadvantaged group.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that brought the whole world to a standstill, has led to financial and health care burden. We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease., Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination., Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed., Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.

N2  - Invasive mechanical has been associated with high mortality in COVID-19. Alternative therapy of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has been greatly debated around the world for use in COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission. This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 10 March 2020 to 24 April 2020 with moderate-to-severe respiratory failure treated with HFNT. Primary outcome was prevention of intubation. Of the 445 patients with COVID-19, 104 met our inclusion criteria. The average age was 60.66 (+13.50) years, 49 (47.12 %) were female, 53 (50.96%) were African-American, 23 (22.12%) Hispanic. Forty-three patients (43.43%) were smokers. Saturation to fraction ratio and chest X-ray scores had a statistically significant improvement from day 1 to day 7. 67 of 104 (64.42%) were able to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation in our cohort. Incidence of hospital-associated/ventilator-associated pneumonia was 2.9%. Overall, mortality was 14.44% (n=15) in our cohort with 13 (34.4%) in the progressed to intubation group and 2 (2.9%) in the non-intubation group. Mortality and incidence of pneumonia was statistically higher in the progressed to intubation group. CONCLUSION : HFNT use is associated with a reduction in the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Smoking impairs lung immune functions and damages upper airways, increasing risks of contracting and severity of infectious diseases., METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 1-May 25, 2020. We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease, including death. We used a random effects meta-analysis and used meta-regression and lowess regressions to examine relationships in the data., RESULTS: We identified 47 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 31,871 COVID-19 patients, 5,759 (18.1%) experienced disease progression and 5,734 (18.0%) with a history of smoking. Among smokers, 29.2% experienced disease progression, compared with 21.1% of non-smokers. The meta-analysis confirmed an association between smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.83, p=0.001). Smoking was associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.007). We found no significant difference (p=0.432) between the effects of smoking on COVID-19 disease progression between adjusted and unadjusted analyses, suggesting that smoking is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression. We also found the risk of having COVID-19 progression among younger adults (p=0.023), with the effect most pronounced among people under about 45 years old., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is an independent risk for having severe progression of COVID-19, including mortality. The effects seem to be higher among young people. Smoking prevention and cessation should remain a priority for the public, physicians, and public health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19., DESIGN: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers., DATA SOURCE: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease., RESULTS: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking depresses pulmonary immune function and is a risk factor contracting other infectious diseases and more serious outcomes among people who become infected. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the association between smoking and progression of the infectious disease COVID-19., METHODS: PubMed was searched on April 28, 2020, with search terms "smoking", "smoker*", "characteristics", "risk factors", "outcomes", and "COVID-19", "COVID", "coronavirus", "sar cov-2", "sar cov 2". Studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease were selected for the final analysis. The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. A random effects meta-analysis was applied., RESULTS: We identified 19 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 11,590 COVID-19 patients, 2,133 (18.4%) with severe disease and 731 (6.3%) with a history of smoking. A total of 218 patients with a history of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 17.6% of non-smoking patients. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.59, p = 0.001). Limitations in the 19 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers., IMPLICATIONS: Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Mexico, given that it currently is in active community transmission., METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were fitted to study odds of death of characteristics and comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico., RESULTS: Age, sex, and the most frequent comorbidities diabetes, obesity, and hypertension were significantly associated to the risk of death by COVID-19 (P < .0001). Smoking habit was not identified as a risk factor for death. Less-frequent comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and patients with immunosuppressed conditions also showed a significant risk for death (P < .0001). Hospitalized patients and those with pneumonia had serious risks for mortality (P < .0001), and more attention to specific conditions might be considered during clinical admission., CONCLUSIONS: A more vulnerable positive patient is depicted by a male patient, older than 41 years, which increases their risk with more prevalent comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Some implications on outcomes are discussed. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Peoples of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions live in social and physical environments that differ substantially from those of their more southern-dwelling counterparts. The cold northern climate keeps people indoors, amplifying the effects of household crowding, smoking, and inadequate ventilation on person-to-person spread of infectious disease. The emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens, the reemergence of tuberculosis, the entrance of HIV into Arctic communities, and the spectre of pandemic influenza or the sudden emergence and introduction of new viral pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome are of increasing concern to residents, governments, and public health authorities. The International Circumpolar Surveillance system is a network of hospital, public health agencies, and reference laboratories throughout the Arctic linked together to collect, compare, and share uniform laboratory and epidemiologic data on infectious diseases and assist in the formulation of prevention and control strategies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding the association between preexisting cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the outcomes of patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained., RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P < 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P < 0.001) and invasive MV (P < 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P < 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3% vs. 1.6%; P < 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3% vs. 1.7%; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51-3.90; P < 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06-5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death., CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, the patients with confirmed COVID-19 with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs had worse clinical outcomes. Caution is required in dealing with these patients at triage. Copyright © 2021 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

T1  - Associating the Change in New COVID-19 Cases to GDP per Capita in 38 European Countries in the First Wave of the Pandemic.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - COVID-19 has affected all countries globally. We explore associations between the change in new COVID-19 registered cases per million population and various macroeconomic and well-being indicators in 38 European countries over a 2-month period (1st April-31st May 2020). A statistically significant (p = 0.002) negative association was estimated between the change in new COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita, after controlling for key health determinants including public expenditure on health, life expectancy, smoking tobacco and sanitation. The country with the highest GDP per capita in Europe (i.e., Luxemburg) was found to experience the lowest change in new COVID-19 cases within the time period whilst the opposite was found for countries with lower GDP per capita (i.e., Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania). The outcomes of this study indicate that, in the first wave of the pandemic in Europe, a country's GDP per capita might be associated with a lower rate of new COVID-19 cases. The study concludes by suggesting that in European regions a country's economic performance should be a critical health priority for policy makers. Copyright © 2021 Pardhan and Drydakis.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the race-stratified state-level prevalence of health determinants and the racial disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence and mortality in the United States., Patients and Methods: The age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and malignant neoplasm), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, and physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, and health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality rate and infection-fatality ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states., Results: Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3%; 95% CI, 62.4% to 64.2% vs 55.1%; 95% CI, 54.7% to 55.5%) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0%; 95% CI, 46.0% to 47.9% vs 30.9%; 95% CI, 30.6% to 31.3%) than did whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar in blacks (30.4%; 95% CI, 28.8% to 32.1%) and whites (30.8%; 95% CI, 30.2% to 31.4%). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in whites (57.2%; 95% CI, 56.3% to 58.0%) than in blacks (50.2%; 95% CI,46.2% to 54.2%). Comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the western region. The cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was 3-fold higher in blacks (1546.4) than in whites (540.4). The crude mortality rate (per 100,000 persons) was 2-fold higher in blacks (83.2) than in whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality ratio (per 100 cases) was similar in whites (6.2) and blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with the state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (P>.05 for all)., Conclusion: Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.

T1  - Known drugs and small molecules in the battle for COVID-19 treatment.
A1  - Panoutsopoulos, Alexios A
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th and since then more than 3 million cases and a quarter million deaths have occurred due to it. The urge to find a resultful treatment or cure is now pressing more than any other time since the outbreak of the pandemic. Researchers all over the world from different fields of expertise are trying to find the most suitable drugs, that are already known to treat other diseases, and could tackle the process of SARS-CoV2 through which it invades and replicates in human cells. Here, we discuss five of the most promising drugs that can potentially play a major role in the treatment of COVID-19. While nicotine and ivermectin may be blocking transport abilities of the virus or its components, famotidine, remdesivir and chloroquine in combination with zinc ions can deactivate important enzymes needed for the replication of the virus. While clinical trials for some of these drugs have already started, it is common knowledge that lack of organization between countries, institutes and hospitals might slow down the whole process for an official treatment based in wide, randomized, placebo controlled trials.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the country-level determinants of the severity of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: Ecological study of publicly available data. Countries reporting >25 COVID-19 related deaths until 8 June 2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, population >65 years, average body mass index and smoking prevalence); economic parameters (gross domestic product per capita); environmental parameters (pollution levels and mean temperature (January-May); comorbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer); health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10 000 population); international arrivals; the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19; BCG vaccination coverage; UV radiation exposure; and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data., PRIMARY OUTCOME: Country-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase., PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK and the USA., RESULTS: Of all country-level determinants included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (95% CI -0.034 to -0.002)), were significantly associated with the natural logarithm of the mean death rate., CONCLUSIONS: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent related deaths. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - Background: The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has led to a global pandemic in which case fatality rate (CFR) has varied from country to country. This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion:  Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.

N2  - Background and Aim: Hepatic steatosis (HS) is associated with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, comorbidities recently related to COVID-19 severity. Here, we assessed if tomographic HS is also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia., Methods: We included 213 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and chest computed tomography (CT) from an out-hospital facility and a hospital. We obtained information on demographics; weight; height; smoking history; diabetes; hypertension; and cardiovascular, lung, and renal disease. Two radiologists scored the CO-RADs system (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System) (1 = normal, 2 = inconsistent, 3-4 = indeterminate, and 5 = typical findings) and the chest CT severity index (>=20 of 40 was considered severe disease). They evaluated the liver-to-spleen ratio (CTL/S) and defined tomographic steatosis as a CTL/S index <=0.9. We used descriptive statistics, chi2 and t student tests, logistic regression, and reported odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)., Results: Of the patients, 61% were men, with a mean age of 51.2 years, 48.3% were CO-RADs 1 and 51.7% CO-RADs 2-5. Severe tomographic disease was present in 103 patients (48.4%), all CO-RADs 5. This group was older; mostly men; and with a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and HS (69.9 vs 29%). On multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.03-1.086, P < 0.0001), male gender (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.03-3.8, P = 0.04), and HS (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.4-9.7, P < 0.0001) remained associated., Conclusion: HS was independently associated with severe COVID pneumonia. The physiopathological explanation of this finding remains to be elucidated. CTL/S should be routinely measured in thoracic CT scans in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Preliminary reports indicated that smokers could be less susceptible to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, once infected an increased risk of severe disease is reported. We investigated the association between smoking and COVID-19 during an outbreak of the disease on a naval vessel., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on the 1769 sailors of a same navy aircraft carrier at sea exposed at the same time to SARS-CoV2 to investigate the link between tobacco consumption and Covid-19., RESULTS: Among the 1688 crewmembers (87% men; median age= 28 (IQR 23-35)) included, 1279 (76%) developed Covid-19 (1038 (62%) RT-PCR-positive and 241 (14%) with only clinical signs). One hundred and seven patients were hospitalized. The univariable analysis odds ratio (OR) for Covid-19 infection was 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.78; P<0.001) for current smokers vs. former and nonsmokers; sex, body mass index or blood group had no significant impact. Crewmembers >50 years old had an increased risk of contracting Covid-19 (OR, 2.84 [95% CI, 1.30-7.5]; P=0.01). Multivariable analysis retained the lower risk of current smokers becoming infected (OR, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]; P<0.001) and age >50 years was significatively associated with Covid-19 (OR, 2.6 [1.17-6.9]; P=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as an efficient protection against infection. Mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research., IMPLICATIONS: Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and Covid-19. Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significant lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71%) versus former and non smokers (80%). This finding strongly supports the need for further research on nicotine physiological pathway and its impact on COVID-19 infection whilst emphasizing that tobacco smoking should not be considered as an efficient protection against COVID-19.

N2  - Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter human cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB) are associated with ACE-2 upregulation. We hypothesized that antecedent use of ACEI/ARB may be associated with mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods and Results We used the Coracle registry, which contains data of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 4 regions of Italy, and restricted analyses to those >=50 years of age. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Among these 781 patients, 133 (17.0%) used an ARB and 171 (21.9%) used an ACEI. While neither sex nor smoking status differed by user groups, patients on ACEI/ARB were older and more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. The overall mortality rate was 15.1% (118/781) and increased with age (PTrend<0.0001). The crude odds ratios (ORs) for death for ACEI users and ARB users were 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.60, P=0.9333, and 1.13, 95% CI, 0.67-1.91, P=0.6385, respectively. After adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure, antecedent ACEI administration was associated with reduced mortality (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.98, P=0.0436); a similar, but weaker trend was observed for ARB administration (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.07, P=0.0796). Conclusions In those aged >=50 years hospitalized with COVID-19, antecedent use of ACEI was independently associated with reduced risk of inpatient death. Our findings suggest a protective role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in patients with high cardiovascular risk affected by COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities., METHODS: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality., RESULTS: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30kg/m2. The median age was 64years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI<25kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI>=35kg/m2: 34.8%, p=0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI>=35kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI>=35kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45-9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25-5.98; p=0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13-2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI>=35kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI>=35kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation., CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic had exhibited negative effects on patients with a nicotine use disorder because of social stress situations. The objective of this study is to investigate the changes that occurred in the smoking habits of the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic because of the COVID-19 outbreak's effect (coronaphobia) on their mental health., METHOD: In this study, we included the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic between January 1 and June 30, 2020. We conducted telephonic and face-to-face interviews with the patients during the outbreak, and inquired about the changes in their smoking habits., RESULTS: In total, 114 volunteers (mean age: 41.2 years [min-max: 18-82 years], M/F: 70/44 [61.4/38.6%]) who registered in the smoking cessation clinic of Chest Diseases Clinic were included in the study. The number of people with and without coronaphobia was 64 (56.1%) and 50 (43.9%), respectively. The analyses of the changes in smoking behaviors because of coronaphobia demonstrated that people with coronaphobia exhibited a significantly higher decrease or cessation of smoking as compared to no change in smoking behavior or increase in the number of cigarettes (p: .006)., CONCLUSIONS: Success in smoking cessation can be increased with the accurate analyses of the anxiety effects caused by coronaphobia after COVID-19 outbreak on the desire of smoking cessation. This resolution depends on the solution-oriented strategies that will increase the awareness of physicians and patients, a close follow-up of patients with tools such as telemedicine, and a quick determination of their needs.

N2  - There has been a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driven by westernization, urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. The prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors vary considerably in SSA between countries and the various sub-populations. A study documented the prevalence of stroke ranging from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43%, and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. The numbers of these NCD cases are predicted to rise over the next decade. However, in the context of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, with the rising cases, lockdowns and deaths recorded worldwide, many people living with NCDs may find accessing care more difficult. The majority of the available resources on the subcontinent have been diverted to focus on the ongoing pandemic. This has caused interruptions in care, complication management, drug pick-up alongside the almost neglected silent NCD epidemic, with major consequences for the health system post the COVID-19 era. We explore the issues surrounding the continuity of care and offer some solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa.

T1  - Coronavirus-2019 Disease (COVID-19) in Children.
A1  - Ovali, Fahri
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - COVID-19 disease affects all ages, but severe cases of the disease and mortality are very rarely seen among children. In most cases, they acquire the virus from their parents or from an another infected person. The exact reasons why the disease has a milder course in children is unknown but high numbers of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, underdeveloped immune responses, cross-reaction with other viruses, protective effect of fetal hemoglobin and fewer outdoor activities as well as journeys, and nonexposure to air pollution, and smoking. Although many cases are asymptomatic, they can still shed the virus. Materno-fetal vertical transmission has not been shown so far. In symptomatic cases, clinical findings include fever and respiratory symptoms, followed by diarrhea and vomiting. There are signs indicating a possible association between Kawasaki disease and COVID-19. Clinical findings and diagnostic procedures in newborns, and older children are similar. Supportive therapy is essential and antiviral agents are not required in most cases. During cytokine storm, anti-inflammatory treatments may be tried. There is no evidence for transmission through breastmilk; therefore infected mothers should breastfeed their infants by taking all precautions. Routine immunizations of children should not be deferred during COVID-19 outbreak period. Psychological support for children who need to stay at home and for healthcare personnel should be provided. © Copyright Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine.

T1  - Desperate Times, Desperate Measures: The Case for RRx-001 in the Treatment of COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - This article summarizes the likely attenuation properties of RRx-001 in COVID-19 based on its mechanism of action and the putative pathogenesis of the disease, which appears to activate inflammatory, oxidative, and immune cascades with the potential to culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm and death. An ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 appears to present with 3 major patterns of clinical symptomatology: (1) mild upper respiratory tract infection, (2) non-life-threatening pneumonia, and (3) severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that initially manifest as a mild prodrome lasting for 7-8 days before rapid clinical and radiological deterioration requiring ICU transfer. RRx-001 is a targeted nitric oxide donor. This small molecule, which has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1-2 clinical trials for cancer as well as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer called REPLATINUM (NCT03699956), is minimally toxic and demonstrates clear evidence of antitumor activity. During the course of these clinical trials it was noted that the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and pneumonia in actively smoking small cell lung cancer patients treated with RRx-001 is less than 1%. Due to extensive history of tobacco use, 40%-70% of patients with lung cancer have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the expected rate of pulmonary infection in this population is 50%-70%, which was not observed in RRx-001 clinical trials. Moreover, in preclinical studies of pulmonary hypertension, RRx-001 was found to be comparable with or more effective than the FDA approved agent, Bosentan. The potential pulmonary protective effects of RRx-001 in patients with recurrent lung infections coupled with preclinical models demonstrating RRx-001-mediated reversal of pulmonary hypertension suggests RRx-001 may have therapeutic activity in patients with acute respiratory symptoms due to COVID 19. Clinical trials have been initiated to confirm the hypothesis that RRx-001 may be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In early February of 2020, attention was drawn to the increased number of deaths and the new cases of coronavirus infection. The epicentre of the outbreak was Wuhan in the People's Republic of China. In order to control the outbreak, Chinese leaders called on the city authorities in Wuhan to set up mass quarantine centres for infected people. The Chinese government took this step to protect the public against infectious disease. This is an example of the conflicts between public health and civil liberties/individual rights. Government authority is the pillar of the public health law. The government retains the power to achieve and maintain common good by restricting - within solid international and national limits - individual rights concerning autonomy, privacy, association, and liberty. Public health agencies have the right to collect, use, and disclose a considerable amount of personal health information and to enforce certain vaccinations, medical examinations, and treatments. In addition to the power to isolate individuals to protect the public against the spread of infectious disease, their powers can be used to control businesses and professions. There are several legal interventions to prevent injury and disease and promote the public's health. Among these tools are taxing policies, which encourage engaging in beneficial behaviour (fruit consumption) and disincentives to engage in high-risk activities (smoking).

N2  - The novel coronavirus (NCOVID-19) has quickly become a public health concern globally and needs urgent attention. While there is no current evidence of vaccines and specific drugs to prevent and treat the ailments emanating from NCOVID-19 infections, complementary and conventional medical treatments could prove beneficial in ameliorating some of the respiratory difficulties, especially in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These treatments include specific breathing exercises, a diet that strengthens the immune system, as well as avoiding tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. On the other hand, for those who have not contracted the virus, participation in indoor and within-the-yard physical activity could be beneficial in preventing unwanted weight gain as well as associated conditions such as anxiety and depression.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Aim: The economic burden caused by death and disease in the world is credited mainly to tobacco use-currently linked to approximately 8,000,000 deaths per year with approximately 80% of these faralities reported in low and middle income economies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 7,000,000 deaths are attributed to direct tobacco use, while approximately 1,200,000 non-smokers exposed to second hand cigarette smoke die every year. Accordingly, tobacco use is a major threat to the public health infrastructure; therefore, proper cessation interventions must be put in place to curb tobacco abuse and ease economic and social burdens caused by the tobacco epidemic., Methods: A systematic review was conducted to investigate how scientific efforts have been advanced towards harm reduction among smokers and non-smokers. Relevant articles published during the period 2010-2020 in PubMed, Crossref, Google scholar, and Web of Science were used in this study. The articles were selected based on health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco cessation and emerging diseases, including Covid-19. Various cessation strategies have been identified although their efficiency is yet to match the desired results., Results: A series of carcinogenic chemicals are generated during cigarette smoking resulting in serious health complications such as cancer and mutagenesis. The precursors for tobacco induced diseases are toxic and carcinogenic chemicals of the nitrosamine type, aldehydes, polonium-210 and benzo[a]pyrene, which bio-accumulate in the body system during cigarette smoking to cause disease. Rehabilitation facilities, use of drugs to diminish the desire to smoke, heavy taxation of tobacco products and warning labels on cigarettes are some of the cessation strategies employed towards curbing tobacco abuse., Conclusion: The need for further research to develop better methods and research based policies for safe cigarette smoking and workable cessation strategies must be a priority in order to deal with the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to promote tobacco cessation and abstinence are recommended in this review as a sure measure to mitigate against the deleterious impacts caused by cigarette smoking and tobacco abuse.

T1  - COVID-19 Susceptibility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
A1  - Olloquequi, Jordi
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - In barely nine months, the pandemic known as COVID-19 has spread over 200 countries, affecting more than 22 million people and causing over than 786 000 deaths. Elderly people and patients with previous comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are at an increased risk to suffer a poor prognosis after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although the same could be expected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), current epidemiological data are conflicting. This could lead to a reduction of precautionary measures in these patients, in the context of a particularly complex global health crisis. Most COPD patients have a long history of smoking or exposure to other harmful particles or gases, capable of impairing pulmonary defences even years after the absence of exposure. Moreover, COPD is characterized by an ongoing immune dysfunction, which affects both pulmonary and systemic cellular and molecular inflammatory mediators. Consequently, increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections have been reported in COPD, often worsened by bacterial co-infections and leading to serious clinical outcomes. The present paper is an up-to-date review that discusses the available research regarding the implications of coronavirus infection in COPD. Although validation in large studies is still needed, COPD likely increases SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and increases COVID-19 severity. Hence, specific mechanisms to monitor and assess COPD patients should be addressed in the current pandemic.

T1  - Is nicotine exposure linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 in the general population?.
A1  - Olds, James L
A1  - Kabbani, Nadine
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The recent emergence of COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide crisis, with large populations locked down and transportation links severed. While approximately 80% of infected individuals have minimal symptoms, around 15-20% need to be hospitalized, greatly stressing global healthcare systems. As of March 10, the death rate appears to be about 3.4%, although this number is highly stratified among different populations. Here, we focus on those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus. We predict that these individuals are 'primed' to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus (ACE2) and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells.

N2  - Although pulmonary fibrosis can occur in the absence of a clear-cut inciting agent, and without a clinically clear initial acute inflammatory phase, it is more commonly associated with severe lung injury. This may be due to respiratory infections, chronic granulomatous diseases, medications, and connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction. Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the evidence in support of the putative risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis in the disease and propose risk mitigation strategies. We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism. With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in Kenya on March 13, 2020, is spreading rapidly. As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya. All due care should be taken, to prevent and effectively manage the disease, to avert an imminent epidemic of atherosclerotic disease. Copyright ©Julius Ogeng'o et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical features of patients presenting to the ED with suspected and confirmed COVID-19., METHODS: The COVID-19 ED (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study in Australian EDs. This analysis presents data from eight sites across Victoria and Tasmania for July 2020 (during Australia's 'second wave'). All adult patients who met criteria for 'suspected COVID-19' and underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Study outcomes included a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and mechanical ventilation., RESULTS: In the period 1 July to 31 July 2020, there were 30 378 presentations to the participating EDs and 2917 (9.6%; 95% confidence interval 9.3-9.9) underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 50 (2%) patients returned a positive result. Among positive cases, two (4%) received mechanical ventilation during their hospital admission compared to 45 (2%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (odds ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 0.4-7.3; P = 0.47). Two (4%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died in hospital compared to 46 (2%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (odds ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 0.4-7.1; P = 0.49). Strong clinical predictors of a positive SARS-CoV-2 result included self-reported fever, non-smoking status, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and absence of a leucocytosis on first ED blood tests (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In this prospective multi-site study from July 2020, a substantial proportion of ED patients required SARS-CoV-2 testing, isolation and enhanced infection prevention and control precautions. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was not associated with death or mechanical ventilation. Copyright © 2020 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The presence of any underlying heart condition could influence outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive., RESULTS: HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p < 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95% CI 1.29-2.03; p < 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p < 0.001), and mortality (39.7% vs. 15.5%; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19. Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during in-hospital stay. Trial Numbers: NCT04334291/ EUPAS34399.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are concerns that COVID-19 mitigation measures, including the 'lockdown', may have unintended health consequences. We examined trends in mental health and health behaviours in the UK before and during the initial phase of the COVID-19 lockdown and differences across population subgroups., METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, including representative samples of over 27,000 adults (aged 18+) interviewed in four survey waves between 2015 and 2020. A total of 9748 adults had complete data for longitudinal analyses. Outcomes included psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12), loneliness, current cigarette smoking, use of e-cigarettes and alcohol consumption. Cross-sectional prevalence estimates were calculated and multilevel Poisson regression assessed associations between time period and the outcomes of interest, as well as differential associations by age, gender, education level and ethnicity., RESULTS: Psychological distress increased 1 month into lockdown with the prevalence rising from 19.4% (95% CI 18.7% to 20.1%) in 2017-2019 to 30.6% (95% CI 29.1% to 32.3%) in April 2020 (RR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4). Groups most adversely affected included women, young adults, people from an Asian background and those who were degree educated. Loneliness remained stable overall (RR=0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.5). Smoking declined (RR=0.9, 95% CI=0.8,1.0) and the proportion of people drinking four or more times per week increased (RR=1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.5), as did binge drinking (RR=1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.7)., CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress increased 1 month into lockdown, particularly among women and young adults. Smoking declined, but adverse alcohol use generally increased. Effective measures are required to mitigate negative impacts on health. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes fear, as its immediate consequences for the public have produced unprecedented challenges for the education and healthcare systems. We aimed to validate the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) and examine the association of its scores with health literacy and health-related behaviors among medical students. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 7 to 29 April 2020 on 5423 students at eight universities across Vietnam, including five universities in the North, one university in the Center, two universities in the South. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data on participants' characteristics, health literacy, fear of COVID-19 using the FCoV-19S, and health-related behaviors. The results showed that seven items of the FCoV-19S strongly loaded on one component, explained 62.15% of the variance, with good item-scale convergent validity and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90). Higher health literacy was associated with lower FCoV-19S scores (coefficient, B, -0.06; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, -0.08, -0.04; p < 0.001). Older age or last academic years, being men, and being able to pay for medication were associated with lower FCoV-19S scores. Students with higher FCoV-19S scores more likely kept smoking (odds ratio, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.14; p < 0.001) or drinking alcohol (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; p < 0.001) at an unchanged or higher level during the pandemic, as compared to students with lower FCoV-19S scores. In conclusion, the FCoV-19S is valid and reliable in screening for fear of COVID-19. Health literacy was found to protect medical students from fear. Smoking and drinking appeared to have a negative impact on fear of COVID-19. Strategic public health approaches are required to reduce fear and promote healthy lifestyles during the pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first reported in Malaysia in March 2020. We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19., METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists., RESULTS: In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [+/-SD], 21.64+/-2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19., CONCLUSION: We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thoraxfor early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older agegroups, and not in younger patients.

T1  - Mortality in COVID-19: Further Evidence for a Sex-Based Difference in the OpenSAFELY Study.
A1  - Newman, Connie B
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Although COVID-19 death rates are lower in women compared to men, it is not clear whether this difference in mortality is due to sex (biological) based factors, comorbidities that differ in men and women, or gender influences. New evidence supports a sex-based difference in COVID-19 mortality. Data from the OpenSAFELY cohort study in 17 million adult patients in England demonstrate that COVID-19-related deaths were associated with male sex (hazard ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval 1.53-1.65) when fully adjusted for age, low income, smoking, pre-existing diseases, and ethnicity. Women have stronger innate and adaptive responses to infection. It is hypothesized that biological differences in the immune system may have a role in the sex-based difference in mortality from COVID-19. The results of OpenSAFELY demonstrate the importance of collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data in research and public surveillance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are conflicting results in the literature regarding the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients. The effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity has been little studied. In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients and the effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity., METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients were contacted by phone and those who approved to participate in the study were questionned about their sociodemographic characteristics, body-mass index, smoking history, and about their atopic status. Rate of atopic diseases among mild and severe COVID-19 patients and risk estimates for mild disease in atopic and non-atopic COVID-19 patients were calculated., RESULTS: Study population consisted of 235 adults with COVID-19 (mean age, 45.3 years [standard deviation, 15.0 years]; 139 (59.1%) male). Among study population 16 (6.8%) subjects had one of the three atopic symptoms which were wheezing, rhinitis or eczema. Among the subjects with atopic status 4 (1.7%) subjects had wheezing, 8 (3.4%) had rhinitis and 4 (1.7%) had eczema within the last 12 months. Although atopic status is associated with 3.1 times higher odds for mild disease, being atopic or not being atopic was not found to be associated with COVID-19 severity (p=.054)., CONCLUSION: The information that atopic diseases are less common in COVID-19 patients may guide clinical risk classification.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To provide baseline cohort descriptives and assess change in health behaviours since the UK COVID-19 lockdown., DESIGN: A prospective cohort (N = 1,044) of people recruited online, purposively targeting vulnerable populations., METHODS: After a baseline survey (April 2020), participants completed 3 months of daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Dietary, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vaping and substance use behaviours collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with daily EMA surveys over the first 30 days during early lockdown. Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models., RESULTS: 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, participants ate almost one portion of fruit and vegetables less per day (vegetables mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.40, -0.25; fruit -0.57, 95% CI -0.64, -0.50), but showed no change in high sugar portions per day (-0.03, 95% CI -0.12, 0.06). Participants spent half a day less per week doing >=30 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (-0.57, 95% CI -0.73, -0.40) but slightly increased days of strength training (0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.34), increased alcohol intake (AUDIT-C score change 0.25, 95% CI 0.13, 0.37), though did not change smoking, vaping or substance use behaviour. Worsening health behaviour change was associated with being younger, female and higher body mass index., CONCLUSIONS: The cohort reported worsening health behaviours during early lockdown. Longer term changes will be investigated using further waves of data collection. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a threat to human life and society. Scientists and clinicians are struggling with the intrusive SARS-CoV-2 virus to enhance their knowledge about its pathogenesis and find an effective medicine and vaccine to combat its complications. Till now, they have learned that this SARS-CoV-2 has not infected all people exposed to this virus, and also severe respiratory illnesses have not been observed in all infected patients. Patients over 65 or with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to develop severe disease. Based on this premise, a high challengeable question is why some people are more susceptible to this virus and others are not. The present study was aimed to reviewthe current information which explains the broad spectrum of COVID-19 presentation.Herewe discussed that how genetic background, immune system, underlying disease, smokingstatus as well as age, race, and gender affect COVID-19 susceptibility.

N2  - In December 2019, the emergence of a novel coronavirus, which rapidly turned into a pandemic that posed a public health threat of global concern and has had a huge impact on the health of millions of people around the world. Existing evidence indicates relatively low incidence and mild severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children compared with adults; although the precise underlying reasons for such disparity remain obscure. The article provides general information about COVID-19 and epidemiological data of the disease in children, its clinical manifestations and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The main aim of this article is to explore the reasons given for the mildness of the disease in pediatric patients. Several theories related to immunosenescence, vaccination and trained immunity, co-infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 maturation and expression, viral exposure, overall health and smoking have been proposed in recent literature. However, due to the novelty of this virus and the lack of information about it, these reasons are not conclusive; however, these points are considered as possible reasons for the low prevalence and mildness of the disease in pediatric patients.

N2  - AIMS: The risk and burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are higher in homeless than in housed individuals but population-based analyses are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, incidence and outcomes across a range of specific CVDs among homeless individuals., METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linked UK primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and validated phenotypes, we identified homeless individuals aged >=16 years between 1998 and 2019, and age- and sex-matched housed controls in a 1:5 ratio. For 12 CVDs (stable angina; unstable angina; myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; unheralded coronary death; heart failure; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm), we estimated prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality post-diagnosis, comparing homeless and housed groups. We identified 8492 homeless individuals (32 134 matched housed individuals). Comorbidities and risk factors were more prevalent in homeless people, e.g. smoking: 78.1% vs. 48.3% and atrial fibrillation: 9.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001. CVD prevalence (11.6% vs. 6.5%), incidence (14.7 vs. 8.1 per 1000 person-years), and 1-year mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.08, P < 0.001] were higher, and onset was earlier (difference 4.6, 95% CI 2.8-6.3 years, P < 0.001), in homeless, compared with housed people. Homeless individuals had higher CVD incidence in all three arterial territories than housed people., CONCLUSION: CVD in homeless individuals has high prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality risk post-diagnosis with earlier onset, and high burden of risk factors. Inclusion health and social care strategies should reflect this high preventable and treatable burden, which is increasingly important in the current COVID-19 context. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the epidemiological and clinical factors predictive of the case fatality rate (CFR) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in an outbreak in Daejeon, the Republic of Korea., METHODS: We reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional MERS cases in hospitals A (14 cases) and B (11 cases), and conducted an in-depth interview with the index case., RESULTS: The CFR in hospital B was higher than that in hospital A (63.6% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Higher MERS-CoV exposure conditions were also found in hospital B, including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and nebulizer use in a six-bed admission room. The host factors associated with high CFR were pre-existing pneumonia, smoking history, an incubation period of less than 5 days, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as sputum and dyspnea., CONCLUSIONS: The conditions surrounding MERS-CoV exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre-existing pneumonia may explain the high CFR in hospital B. The clinical features described above may enable prediction of the prognosis of MERS cases. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

N2  - The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is linked to an increasing number of risk factors, including exogenous (environmental) stimuli such as air pollution, nicotine, and cigarette smoke. These three factors increase the expression of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key receptor involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-the etiological agent of COVID-19-into respiratory tract epithelial cells. Patients with severe COVID-19 are managed with oxygen support, as are at-risk individuals with chronic lung disease. To date, no study has examined whether an increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) may affect the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and co-receptors, including ACE2 and the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS11D. To address this, steady-state mRNA levels for genes encoding these SARS-CoV-2 receptors were assessed in the lungs of mouse pups chronically exposed to elevated FiO2, and in the lungs of preterm-born human infants chronically managed with an elevated FiO2. These two scenarios served as models of chronic elevated FiO2 exposure. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression was assessed in primary human nasal, tracheal, esophageal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as primary mouse alveolar type II cells exposed to elevated oxygen concentrations. While gene expression of ACE2 was unaffected, gene and protein expression of TMPRSS11D was consistently upregulated by exposure to an elevated FiO2. These data highlight the need for further studies that examine the relative contribution of the various viral co-receptors on the infection cycle, and point to oxygen supplementation as a potential risk factor for COVID-19.

N2  - The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking "people's behavioral changes," in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under circumstances in which the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years, were recruited. About 85 percent reported practising the social distancing measures recommended by the government including more females than males and more older than younger participants. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all participants, 92 percent of female, and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23 percent). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60 percent of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50 percent. However, the results also showed that about 20 percent of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, a drinking or smoking habit, and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioural changes using various means to reach and influence them.

N1  - Update in (UIN)
N2  - Recently, there has been an outbreak associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping products, associated lung injury (EVALI). The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.

Air pollution therefore shortens life expectancy worldwide by almost 3 years. Smoking, a proven cardiovascular risk factor, shortens the mean life expectancy by 2.2 years. Epidemiological studies have shown that air pollution from fine and coarse particulate matter is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Responsible for this are mainly cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, hypertension and also diabetes, which are mainly caused or aggravated by fine particulate matter. After inhalation fine particulate matter can reach the brain directly and also reach the bloodstream via a transition process. There, the particles are absorbed by the blood vessels where they stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vascular wall. They therefore promote the formation of atherosclerotic changes and in this way increase the cardiovascular risks, especially an increase in chronic ischemic heart disease and stroke. Recent studies also reported that in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients a high degree of air pollution is correlated with severe disease courses with cardiovascular complications and pulmonary diseases. This necessitates preventive measures, such as lowering of the upper limits for air pollutants. Individual measures to mitigate the health consequences of fine particulate matter are also discussed.

N2  - Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of non-communicable disease globally and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and lung disease. Importantly, recent data by the World Health Organizations (WHO) indicate that in the last two decades global tobacco use has significantly dropped, which was largely driven by decreased numbers of female smokers. Despite such advances, the use of e-cigarettes and waterpipes (shisha, hookah, narghile) is an emerging trend, especially among younger generations. There is growing body of evidence that e-cigarettes are not a harm-free alternative to tobacco cigarettes and there is considerable debate as to whether e-cigarettes are saving smokers or generating new addicts. Here, we provide an updated overview of the impact of tobacco/waterpipe (shisha) smoking and e-cigarette vaping on endothelial function, a biomarker for early, subclinical, atherosclerosis from human and animal studies. Also their emerging adverse effects on the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and the circadian clock are summarized. We briefly discuss heat-not-burn tobacco products and their cardiovascular health effects. We discuss the impact of the toxic constituents of these products on endothelial function and subsequent CVD and we also provide an update on current recommendations, regulation and advertising with focus on the USA and Europe. As outlined by the WHO, tobacco cigarette, waterpipe, and e-cigarette smoking/vaping may contribute to an increased burden of symptoms due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to severe health consequences.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged both institutional and self-management of diabetes. The ongoing social distancing and lock downs have negatively impacted to access to care and self-management., METHODS: This is a narrative review of diabetes management in a resource limited setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic databases, namely; Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for literature. Search terms were "corona virus", "COVID-19", "diabetes self-care", "diabetes self-management education", "DSME", "diabetes self-management", "diabetes self-care in low income countries" and "diabetes management in Zimbabwe"., RESULTS: This paper suggests a culturally tailored educational plan on diabetes self-management of diabetes in a limited resource country, Zimbabwe, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Components of health education comprised general preventive measures, medications, diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood glucose, stress management, foot care, smoking and drinking and preventing complications of diabetes mellitus., CONCLUSIONS: We have reemphasized the need for self-care, social support and a collaborative, patient-centered approach to care amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Is COVID-19 Gender-sensitive?.
A1  - Mukherjee, Shreya
A1  - Pahan, Kalipada
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - While clinical characteristics exhibit that susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equally likely between males and females, clinical outcomes show that males experience both a higher severity and fatality for COVID-19 infection than females. This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

N2  - Introduction: Infection with the new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus is a worldwide public health emergency; its diagnosis is based on molecular tests, while its prognosis depends on the patient's history and on some paraclinical tests. In Colombia, forecasts are not yet counted. Objective: To assess the factors associated with the development of severe disease in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the prognostic factors for the outcome of mortality. Materials and methods: We conducted an ambispective cohort study in hospitalized patients at the Fundacion Cadioinfantil from March to June, 2020. Results: Of the 104 patients analyzed, 31.7% (n=33) had a severe presentation and 9.6% (n=10) had a mortality outcome. For mortality, the most important prognostic factor was the development of severe disease followed by age over 60 years and malnutrition. For the development of the severe disease, prognostic factors were a history of hemodialysis (HR=135), diabetes (HR=4.4), and an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1,004), while the lymphocyte count over 1,064 was a protective factor (HR=0.9). In the classification of patients, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score in the high and low-risk categories corresponded to the best performance. There was no difference between the treatments administered. Conclusions: The most important prognostic factors for mortality were being over 60 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, and cirrhosis, while for the development of severe disease they were chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, NEWS2 with high risk at admission, increased levels of LDH and C reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis.

Y1  - 1975//
N2  - Individuals with chronic lung disease and their families were selected from the Tecumsch community along with similarly selected families as comparison groups and studied for 1-year periods. Occurence of acute respiratory illness was ascertained weekly by telephone and calculated as an annual rate. Persons with chronic bronchitis not only experienced more acute lower respiratory illness than healthy comparison subjects, but total illness rates were somewhat higher as well. Infection rates were determined from blood samples taken 3 times from each participant during the surveillance year. Antibody tests were performed for respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza types A and B, coronavirus OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Differences in serologic infection rates among the subgroups of the population were similar to those seen in the clinical data, with more frequent infection among those with bronchitis than among the comparison subjects. This finding indicates that some degree of increased susceptibility to actual infection existed among those individuals with bronchitis. Influence of smoking on illness and infection rates was also examined. Infections were, in general, more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but illness rates were reversed, suggesting that perception of disease differed in the 2 groups. Rates of illness and infection of other adults in the families of the index individuals with bronchitis were not influenced by the higher rates seen in the index individuals; however, it was of interest that children of persons with bronchitis did have somewhat higher rates of infection than children of comparison subjects.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the trajectory of respiratory failure in COVID-19 and explore factors associated with risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of 112 inpatient adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12 and April 16, 2020. Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV., RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66% male. In-hospital mortality was 6% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8% (6/47), and 18% (5/28) for those requiring IMV. Obesity (OR 5.82, CI 1.74-19.48), former (OR 8.06, CI 1.51-43.06) and current smoking status (OR 10.33, CI 1.43-74.67) were associated with IMV after adjusting for age, sex, and high prevalence comorbidities by multivariable analysis. Initial absolute lymphocyte count (OR 0.33, CI 0.11-0.96), procalcitonin (OR 1.27, CI 1.02-1.57), IL-6 (OR 1.17, CI 1.03-1.33), ferritin (OR 1.05, CI 1.005-1.11), LDH (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.17) and CRP (OR 1.13, CI 1.06-1.21), were associated with IMV by univariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, smoking history, and elevated inflammatory markers were associated with increased need for IMV in patients with COVID-19.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the trajectory of respiratory failure in COVID-19 and explore factors associated with risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of 112 inpatient adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12 and April 16, 2020. Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV., RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66% male. In-hospital mortality was 6% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8% (6/47), and 18% (5/28) for those requiring IMV. Obesity (OR 5.82, CI 1.74-19.48), former (OR 8.06, CI 1.51-43.06) and current smoking status (OR 10.33, CI 1.43-74.67) were associated with IMV after adjusting for age, sex, and high prevalence comorbidities by multivariable analysis. Initial absolute lymphocyte count (OR 0.33, CI 0.11-0.96), procalcitonin (OR 1.27, CI 1.02-1.57), IL-6 (OR 1.17, CI 1.03-1.33), ferritin (OR 1.05, CI 1.005-1.11), LDH (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.17) and CRP (OR 1.13, CI 1.06-1.21), were associated with IMV by univariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, smoking history, and elevated inflammatory markers were associated with increased need for IMV in patients with COVID-19.

N2  - Background & objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread globally including India. The characteristic clinical observations and outcomes of this disease (COVID-19) have been reported from different countries. The present study was aimed to describe the clinico-demographic characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of a group of COVID-19 patients in north India., Methods: This was a prospective, single-centre collection of data regarding epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters, management and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care facility in north India. Patient outcomes were recorded as death, discharge and still admitted., Results: Data of 144 patients with COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 40.1+/-13.1 yr, with 93.1 per cent males, and included 10 (6.9%) foreign nationals. Domestic travel to or from affected States (77.1%) and close contact with COVID-19 patients in congregations (82.6%) constituted the most commonly documented exposure. Nine (6.3%) patients were smokers, with a median smoking index of 200. Comorbidities were present in 23 (15.9%) patients, of which diabetes mellitus (n=16; 11.1%) was the most common. A significant proportion of patients had no symptoms (n=64; 44.4%); among the symptomatic, cough (34.7%) was the most common symptom followed by fever (17.4%) and nasal symptoms (2.15%). Majority of the patients were managed with supportive treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin given on a case-to-case basis. Only five (3.5%) patients required oxygen supplementation, four (2.8%) patients had severe disease requiring intensive care, one required mechanical ventilation and mortality occurred in two (1.4%) patients. The time to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity was 16-18 days., Interpretation & conclusions: In this single-centre study of 144 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in north India, the characteristic findings included younger age, high proportion of asymptomatic patients, long time to PCR negativity and low need for intensive care unit care.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a severe inflammatory response. Inflammation affects atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and promotes a thrombogenic environment. We report a series of 6 patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to intraluminal carotid artery thrombus presenting during an 8-day period. Six patients were included (5 men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55-78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had vascular risk factors including diabetes (83%), hyperlipidemia (100%), and smoking (17%). Four patients presented with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores of 24-30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5 patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke.

N2  - In this paper, we studied the in silico interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor with two bioactive compounds, i.e., nicotine and caffeine, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern. Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points* Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.* Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.* Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Adaptation is vital to ensure successful healthcare recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hand trauma represents the most common acute emergency department presentation internationally. This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk, when undergoing management within one of the largest specialist tertiary referral centres in Europe, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken in all patients referred to the integrated hand trauma service, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020); all were evaluated for 30-day COVID-19 related death. Random selection was undertaken for patients with hand trauma who either underwent non-operative (control group) or operative (surgery group) management; these groups were prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at 30 days following first intervention (control group) or postoperatively (surgery group)., RESULTS: Of 731 referred patients (566 operations), there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both groups were matched for sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking, preoperative/first assessment COVID-19 symptoms, pre- and postoperative/first assessment isolation and positive COVID-19 contact (p > 0.050). There were no differences in high service satisfaction (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.067) and treatment outcome (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.961) scores, postoperative/first assessment symptoms (1%, 1/100 compared with 0.8%, 2/250; p = 1.000) or proportion of positive tests (7.1%, 1/14 compared with 2.2%, 2/92; p = 0.349), between the control (n = 100) and surgery (n = 250) groups., CONCLUSION: These data support continued and safe service provision and no increased risk to patients who require surgical management. Such findings are vital for healthcare providers when considering service adaptations to reinstate patient treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of 14 viruses in infants with bronchiolitis and to study demographic and clinical differences in those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and rhinovirus (RV) infection., METHODS: 182 infants aged <12 months hospitalised for bronchiolitis were enrolled. Infants underwent nasal washing for the detection of RSV, influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63, HUK1, adenovirus, RV, parainfluenza 1-3, human metapneumovirus and hBoV. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from parents and from patient medical files. Main outcome measurements were age, breastfeeding history, family smoking habits, family history for asthma and atopy, blood eosinophil count, chest radiological findings, clinical severity score and number of days of hospitalisation., RESULTS: A virus was detected in 57.2% of the 182 infants. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (41.2%), hBoV (12.2%) and RV (8.8%). Infants with dual infections (RSV and hBoV) had a higher clinical severity score and more days of hospitalisation than infants with RSV, RV and hBoV bronchiolitis (mean+/-SD: 4.7+2.4 vs 4.3+/-2.4 vs 3.0+/-2.0 vs 2.9+/-1.7, p<0.05; and 6.0+/-3.2 vs 5.3+/-2.4 vs 4.0+/-1.6 vs 3.9+/-1.1 days; p<0.05). Infants with RV infection had higher blood eosinophil counts than infants with bronchiolitis from RSV and hBoV (307+/-436 vs 138+/-168 vs 89+/-19 n/mm(3); p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the major pathogen responsible for bronchiolitis remains RSV, the infection can also be caused by RV and hBoV. Demographic characteristics and clinical severity of the disease may depend on the number of viruses or on the specific virus detected.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: This study examines the association of contextual factors with the COVID-19 outbreak rate across U.S. counties in its initial phase., Methods: Contextual factors are simultaneously tested at the county- and state-level with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood., Results: The variation between states is substantial and significant (ICC = 0.532, u 0 = 8.20E-04, P < .001). At the state level, the cultural value of collectivism and the contextual factor of government spending are positively associated with the outbreak rate. At the county level, the racial and ethnic composition contributes to outbreak differences, disproportionally affecting black/African, native, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as well as native Hawaiians. Counties with a higher median age and a higher household income have a stronger outbreak. Better education and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Obesity and smoking are negatively related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak., Conclusions: Because of a high variation in contextual factors, policy makers need to target pandemic responses to the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in confirmed COVID-19 patients have been summarized in numerous meta-analyses, but it is still unclear whether they vary according to the age, sex and health conditions of the studied populations. This study explored these variables as potential mortality predictors., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases of studies available through July 27, 2020. The pooled risk was estimated with the odds ratio (p-OR) or effect size (p-ES) obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were applied to explore differences by age, sex and health conditions. The MOOSE guidelines were strictly followed., RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 60 studies, with a total of 51,225 patients (12,458 [24.3%] deaths) from hospitals in 13 countries. A higher in-hospital mortality risk was found for dyspnoea (p-OR = 2.5), smoking (p-OR = 1.6) and several comorbidities (p-OR range: 1.8 to 4.7) and laboratory parameters (p-ES range: 0.3 to -2.6). Age was the main source of heterogeneity, followed by sex and health condition. The following predictors were more markedly associated with mortality in studies with patients with a mean age <=60 years: dyspnoea (p-OR = 4.3), smoking (p-OR = 2.8), kidney disease (p-OR = 3.8), hypertension (p-OR = 3.7), malignancy (p-OR = 3.7), diabetes (p-OR = 3.2), pulmonary disease (p-OR = 3.1), decreased platelet count (p-ES = -1.7), decreased haemoglobin concentration (p-ES = -0.6), increased creatinine (p-ES = 2.4), increased interleukin-6 (p-ES = 2.4) and increased cardiac troponin I (p-ES = 0.7). On the other hand, in addition to comorbidities, the most important mortality predictors in studies with older patients were albumin (p-ES = -3.1), total bilirubin (p-ES = 0.7), AST (p-ES = 1.8), ALT (p-ES = 0.4), urea nitrogen (p-ES), C-reactive protein (p-ES = 2.7), LDH (p-ES = 2.4) and ferritin (p-ES = 1.7). Obesity was associated with increased mortality only in studies with fewer chronic or critical patients (p-OR = 1.8)., CONCLUSION: The prognostic effect of clinical conditions on COVID-19 mortality vary substantially according to the mean age of patients., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020176595.

N2  - AIM: Poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been linked to diabetes, but its relation to pre-infection glycaemic control is still unclear., MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this question, we report here the association between pre-infection Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services (LHSs), Israel, between 1 February and 30 April 2020. Using the LHS-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, HbA1c, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease., RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c >= 9%., CONCLUSION: Using pre-infection glycaemic control data, we identify HbA1c as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources, and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.

N2  - Importance: Early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may help control the diffusion of the disease into the population., Objective: To investigate the presence of sinonasal manifestations at the onset of COVID-19 to achieve an earlier diagnosis., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalized or discharged from a single referral center. Patients who were unable to answer (intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased) or unreachable by telephone were excluded. Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and 3 refused., Exposures: Sinonasal manifestations reported before COVID-19 diagnosis were studied with a validated questionnaire: Italian Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (I-SNOT-22). If reduction of taste and/or smell was documented by item 5 of the I-SNOT-22, further inquiries were made to score them separately on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no problem and 5 indicating problem as bad as it can be., Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of sinonasal manifestations preceding COVID-19 diagnosis., Results: Among the 204 patients enrolled (110 [53.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 52.6 [14.4] years), the median I-SNOT-22 total score was 21 (range, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 identified 116 patients (56.9%) with reduction of taste and/or smell, 113 (55.4%) with taste reduction (median score, 5; range, 2-5), and 85 (41.7%) with smell reduction (median score, 5; range, 1-5). Eighty-two patients (40.2%) reported both. Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7%), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3%). Only 12 patients (14.8%) with severe taste reduction and 12 patients (16.7%) with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. Severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female vs male patients (odds ratios, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] vs 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) and middle-aged vs younger patients (effect sizes, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). No significant association was observed between smoking habits and severe reduction of taste (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) and/or smell (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21)., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this telephone survey study suggest that reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of COVID-19. Nasal obstruction was not commonly present at the onset of the disease in this study. The general practitioner may play a pivotal role in identifying potential COVID-19 in patients at an early stage if taste and/or smell alterations manifest and in suggesting quarantine before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated., OBJECTIVE: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients., METHODS: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19., RESULTS: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5% were Hispanic, and 12.8% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (compared to non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency were associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with both hospitalization and disease severity., CONCLUSION: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19. It also finds clinical risk factors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 not previously identified such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Stroke in the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been shown to be associated with more severe respiratory symptoms and higher mortality, but little knowledge in this regard exists on older populations. We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of acute stroke in geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors., RESULTS: Combined ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 4.15%. 72.7% of events occurred during acute care. Strokes presented with altered state of consciousness and/or delirium in 81.8%, followed by a focal neurological deficit in 45.5%. Ischemic stroke was more frequently unilateral (88.8%) and localized in the middle cerebral artery territory (55.5%). Smoking and a history of previous stroke increased by more than seven (OR 7.44; 95% CI 1.75-31.64; p = 0.007) and five times (OR 5.19; 95% CI 1.50-17.92; p = 0.009), respectively, the risk of stroke. Each additional point in body mass index (BMI) reduced the risk of stroke by 14% (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.98; p = 0.03). In-hospital mortality (32.1% vs. 27.3%; p > 0.999) and institutionalization at discharge (36.4% vs. 21.1%; p = 0.258) were similar between patients with and without stroke., CONCLUSION: Incident stroke complicating COVID-19 in old patients was associated with active smoking, previous history of stroke, and low BMI. Acute stroke did not influence early mortality or institutionalization rate at discharge.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, a respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan, rapidly evolving into a pandemic. Smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections; thus, cessation represents a huge opportunity for public health. However, there is scarce evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: We performed an observational case-control study, assessing the single-day point prevalence of smoking among 218 COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in 7 Italian non-intensive care wards and in a control group of 243 patients admitted for other conditions to 7 general wards COVID-19-free. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the chi2 test and performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the variables associated with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19., RESULTS: The percentages of current smokers (4.1% vs 16%, p=0.00003) and never smokers (71.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.0014) were significantly different between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower mean age (69.5 vs 74.2 years, p=0.00085) and were more frequently males (59.2% vs 44%, p=0.0011). In the logistic regression analysis, current smokers were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (Odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.48, p<0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.31, p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: We reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. The meaning of these preliminary findings, which are in line with those currently emerging in literature, is unclear; they need to be confirmed by larger studies., IMPLICATIONS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in some Italian non-intensive care wards is reported. This finding could be a stimulus for the generation of novel hypotheses on individual predisposition and possible strategies for reducing the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be confirmed by further larger studies designed with adequate methodology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit. Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19., METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)., FINDINGS: 96 032 patients (mean age 53.8 years, 46.3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11.1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9.3%), hydroxychloroquine (18.0%; hazard ratio 1.335, 95% CI 1.223-1.457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%; 1.447, 1.368-1.531), chloroquine (16.4%; 1.365, 1.218-1.531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22.2%; 1.368, 1.273-1.469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0.3%), hydroxychloroquine (6.1%; 2.369, 1.935-2.900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8.1%; 5.106, 4.106-5.983), chloroquine (4.3%; 3.561, 2.760-4.596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6.5%; 4.011, 3.344-4.812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation., INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19., FUNDING: William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit. Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19., METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)., FINDINGS: 96 032 patients (mean age 53.8 years, 46.3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11.1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9.3%), hydroxychloroquine (18.0%; hazard ratio 1.335, 95% CI 1.223-1.457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%; 1.447, 1.368-1.531), chloroquine (16.4%; 1.365, 1.218-1.531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22.2%; 1.368, 1.273-1.469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0.3%), hydroxychloroquine (6.1%; 2.369, 1.935-2.900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8.1%; 5.106, 4.106-5.983), chloroquine (4.3%; 3.561, 2.760-4.596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6.5%; 4.011, 3.344-4.812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation., INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19., FUNDING: William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context., METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020., RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those <=65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

N2  - The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, typically leads to respiratory failure in severe cases; however, cardiovascular injury is reported to contribute to a substantial proportion of COVID-19 deaths. Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the most common risk factors for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients, and the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 disease progression itself may promote the development of cardiovascular injury, increasing risk of in-hospital death. Sex differences in COVID-19 are becoming more apparent as mounting data indicate that males seem to be disproportionately at risk of severe COVID-19 outcome due to preexisting CVD and COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury. In this review, we will provide a basic science perspective on current clinical observations in this rapidly evolving field and discuss the interplay sex differences, preexisting CVD and COVID-19-related cardiac injury.

N2  - The novel 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the closing of all but essential businesses in California. However, several nonessential businesses have remained open in Southern California despite the mandated "stay at home" order issued by the governor. As part of an ongoing vape shop project involving 88 participating shops, this study investigated the number of vape shops that remained open amidst the coronavirus outbreak and related mandates. Examination of shop social media websites and telephone calls to shops revealed that 61.4% (n = 54) have remained open, particularly within Korean/Asian and Hispanic/Latino ethnic locations (32 of the 54 shops). Importantly, walk-in service was much higher within Hispanic/Latino locations compared to African American, Korean/Asian, or non-Hispanic White neighborhoods (p = 0.03). It is not known if shops that stayed open were in direct violation of the order, didn't know all the details of the order, or found a loophole in the order and believed that they were an essential business. Better communication between the vape shop industry and public health officials during this pandemic is needed.

N2  - This narrative review provides a summary of the impact of tobacco smoking on the respiratory system and the benefits of smoking cessation. Tobacco smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death world-wide and a major risk factor for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections and appears to be related to poorer outcomes among those with COVID-19. Non-smokers with second-hand smoke exposure also experience significant adverse respiratory effects. Smoking imposes enormous health- and non-health-related costs to societies. The benefits of smoking cessation, in both prevention and management of respiratory disease, have been known for decades and, to this day, cessation support remains one of the most important cost-effective interventions that health professionals can provide to people who smoke. Cessation at any age confers substantial health benefits, even in smokers with established morbidities. As other treatments for chronic respiratory disease advance and survival rates increase, smoking cessation treatment will become even more relevant. While smoking cessation interventions are available, the offer of these by clinicians and uptake by patients remain limited. Copyright © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (>=2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with >=2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and >=2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI >=40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population., CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.

N2  - Objectives: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, major changes to how, or even whether, we work have occurred. This study examines associations of changing COVID-19-related employment conditions with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: Data from 2,303 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd-7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were working from home (WFH) when they had not been before, or they lost their job due to the pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessed physical activity, sitting time, and screen time. Linear regression quantified associations of COVID-19-related employment changes with physical activity, sitting time, and screen time, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, marital status, chronic conditions, household location, public health restrictions, and recalled physical activity, sitting time, and screen time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to those whose employment remained unchanged, participants whose employment changed (either WFH or lost their job) due to COVID-19 reported higher sitting time (WFH: g = 0.153, 95% CI = 0.095-0.210; lost job: g = 0.212, 0.113-0.311) and screen time (WFH: g = 0.158, 0.104-0.212; lost job: g = 0.193, 0.102-0.285). There were no significant group differences for physical activity (WFH: g = -0.030, -0.101 to 0.042; lost job: g=-0.070, -0.178 to 0.037). Conclusion:  COVID-19 related employment changes were associated with greater sitting and screen time. As sedentary time is consistently negatively associated with current and future health and wellbeing, increased sedentary time due to employment changes is a public health concern.

N2  - In 2019, the United States experienced the emergence of the vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) epidemic. Vaping is now known to result in the development and progression of severe lung disease in the young and healthy. Lack of regulation on electronic cigarettes in the United States has resulted in over 2,000 patients and 68 deaths. We examine the clinical representation of VALI and the delve into the scientific evidence of how deadly exposure to electronic cigarettes can be. E-cigarette vapor is shown to affect numerous cellular processes, cellular metabolism, and cause DNA damage (which has implications for cancer). E-cigarette use is associated with a higher risk of developing crippling lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which would develop several years from now, increasing the already existent smoking-related burden. The role of vaping and virus susceptibility is yet to be determined; however, vaping can increase the virulence and inflammatory potential of several lung pathogens and is also linked to an increased risk of pneumonia. As it has emerged for cigarette smoking, great caution should also be given to vaping in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, e-cigarettes are continually promoted and perceived as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking. E-cigarettes and their modifiable nature are harmful, as the lungs are not designed for the chronic inhalation of e-cigarette vapor. It is of interest that e-cigarettes have been shown to be of no help with smoking cessation. A true danger lies in vaping, which, if ignored, will lead to disastrous future costs.

N2  - Patients with severe mental illness are more susceptible to infections for a variety of reasons, some associated with the underlying disease and some due to environmental factors including housing insecurity, smoking, poor access to healthcare, and medications used to treat these disorders. This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23 R. These data indicate that short-to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic with currently > 29 million confirmed cases and > 900,000 deaths worldwide. The locations and mechanisms of virus entry into the human respiratory tract are incompletely characterized. We analyzed publicly available RNA microarray datasets for SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and cofactors ACE2, TMPRSS2, BSG (CD147) and FURIN. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are upregulated in the airways of smokers. In asthmatics, ACE2 tended to be downregulated in nasal epithelium, and TMPRSS2 was upregulated in the bronchi. Furthermore, respiratory epithelia were negative for ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression while positive for BSG and furin, suggesting a possible alternative entry route for SARS-CoV-2.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: The COVID-19 is a global public health emergency resulting in lockdowns, associated diet and lifestyle changes and constrained public health delivery., Objective: To investigate the impacts of the COVID-19-induced lockdown in Zimbabwe on nutrition, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking among Zimbabwean population aged >=18 years., Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on demographics (age, gender, place of residence, current employment), food system dimensions, diet and physical activity patterns, stress and anxiety, body image perceptions, lifestyle behaviours like smoking, alcohol intake, screen time and ease of access to health services. Results The participants (n=507) were mostly women (63.0%) between the ages of 31 and 40 years (48.1%) and had tertiary education (91.3%). The lockdown resulted in increase in food prices (94.8%) and decrease in availability of nutritious foods (64%). Most (62.5%) of the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity levels. The prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) was 40.4% and mostly affecting woman (63.5%, p=0.909), 31-40 years age group (49.6%, p=0.886). Based on the Body Mass Index-based Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) 44.5% gained weight, 24.3% lost weight and 31.2% did not have weight change. The paired samples t-test showed that there was a significant increase in perceived body weight (p<0.001). More than half (59.6%) reported having difficulties accessing medicinal drugs and 37.8% growth monitoring services., Conclusions: The lockdown period was associated with increase in food prices, decrease in dietary diversification, elevated GAD symptoms, disrupted diet and consumption patterns. There were low levels of physical activity and perceived weight gained during the lockdown period, thus increasing the risk of overweight and obesity. Further studies incorporating participants of different socioeconomic status are warranted to get more conclusive results. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

N2  - Background The use of computed tomography (CT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in an area of northern Italy with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have identified more patients with this disease than RT-PCR in the very early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9%, the mortality rate was 18.8%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression. Admittedly, the sample of patients in our study was heterogeneous regarding the oncological disease, their prognosis, and the type of treatment; therefore, other studies are needed to confirm our data.

N2  - Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection elicits inflammatory manifestations that relate with a "cytokine storm.", Objective: The aim of this research was to assess the role of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and other inflammatory markers in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on metabolic functions and accompanying clinical complications. Patients and Methods. A total of 165 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were examined for medical features and inflammatory markers such as blood IL-6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, neutrophil/lymphocyte index (NLI), D-Dimer, and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). Regression analyses concerning electronically collected medical data were adjusted by appropriate factors and confounding variables. Results . Plasma IL-6 determinations evidenced a consistent association with hospital stay days, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and mortality rates. Similar trends were found for other proinflammatory variables, where ferritin and NLI showed a remarkable value as surrogates. Hyperglycaemia and the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score were positively associated with the inflammatory response induced by the SARS-COV-2 infection. An unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking and alcoholic drinks consumption as well as excessive body adiposity influenced inflammatory-related outcomes in the screened patients., Conclusion: IL-6 together with other inflammatory biomarkers accompanied poor clinical and metabolic outcomes in COVID-19-infected patients. IL-6 may result in a suitable proxy to individually categorise patients in order to manage this infectious pandemic. Copyright © 2020 Maria Martinez-Urbistondo et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: There are limited, unmatched data reporting low complication rates in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to compare COVID-19-related outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant women after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes., METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-45 years) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic renal disease, immunosuppression, age, language, nationality and level of health insurance. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission., RESULTS: The cohort comprised 5183 pregnant and 175 905 non-pregnant women with COVID-19. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation and ICU admission in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs 1.5%, 9.9% vs 6.5%, 8.1% vs 9.9% and 13.0% vs 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had a higher odds of death (odds ratio (OR), 1.84; 95% CI, 1.26-2.69), pneumonia (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.60-2.16) and ICU admission (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.41-2.45) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.25)., CONCLUSION: After adjusting for background demographic and medical factors, pregnancy is a risk factor for death, pneumonia and ICU admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected women of reproductive age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measured by echocardiography and mortality in COVID-19., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases with keywords "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "2019-nCoV" AND "Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion" OR "TAPSE" up until 20 January 2021. The main outcome was mortality; the effect estimate was reported in hazard ratio (HR) which was pooled from the unadjusted and adjusted effect estimate retrieved from the included studies. Mean difference of the TAPSE (in mm) between non-survivors and survivors were pooled., RESULTS: There were 641 patients from 7 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. TAPSE was lower in non-survivors compared to survivors (mean difference -3.74 [-5.22, -2.26], p < 0.001; I2: 85.5%, p < 0.001). Each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.24 [1.18, 1.31], p < 0.001; I2: 0.0%, p = 0.491). In pooled adjusted model, each 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.21 [1.11, 1.33], p < 0.001; I2: 45.1%, p = 0.156). Meta-regression indicates that the difference in TAPSE between the non-survivors and survivors were affected by COPD (-0.183, p < 0.001) and PASP (-0.344, p = 0.039). but not age (p = 0.668), male (p = 0.821), hypertension (p = 0.101), diabetes (p = 0.603), CAD (p = 0.564), smoking (p = 0.140), and LVEF (p = 0.452)., CONCLUSION: Every 1 mm decrease in TAPSE was associated with approximately 20% increase in mortality., PROSPERO ID: CRD42021232194.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: After massive weight loss, patients that meet specific criteria can be inserted in an ad-hoc post-bariatric surgery list in order to be subjected to body contouring procedures. During COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian National Health System has been overwhelmed by the continue load of life-threatening patients that needed medical assistance. Plastic surgery practice enormously scaled back during this period and this fact greatly affected elective procedures waiting lists. The aim of our study is to analyze how the lockdown and its related sanitary policies affected post-bariatric patients' behaviors towards the delay of their procedure., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 7-item questionnaire was administered to all patients. Change in the desire to be subjected to body contouring procedures was recorded. Smoking status, level of training during quarantine and psychological co-morbidities were also evaluated., RESULTS: 124 patients completed the questionnaire. Data analysis showed that none of them encountered a decrease of the desire to be subjected to post-bariatric plastic surgery procedures., CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that all the patients in the waiting list did not modify their interest in being subjected to post-bariatric surgery procedures, even though the waiting time increased.

N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) firstly emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. After going through the experimental process, the virus was named the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020 which has created a global pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, Alzheimer's, etc. Other predisposing/risk factors consist of smoking and age (elderly people are at higher risk). The 2019-nCoV attacks epithelial cells in all organs, particularly epithelial cells in the lungs, resulting in viral pneumonia. The 2019-nCoV starts its invasion with the attachment and entry into the respiratory tract epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the epithelial cells. The critical problem with 2019-nCoV is its ability in human to the human asymptomatic transmission which causes the rapid and hidden spread of the virus among the population. Also, there are several reports of highly variable and tightly case-dependent clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV2, which made the virus more enigmatic. The clinical symptoms are varied from common manifestations which occurred in flu and cold, such as cough, fever, body-ache, trembling, and runny nose to severe conditions, like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even uncommon/unusual symptoms such as anosmia, skin color change, and stroke. In fact, besides serious injuries in the respiratory system, COVID-19 invades and damages various organs, including the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, and nervous system. Accordingly, to cut the transmission chain of disease and control the infection spread. One of the major solutions seems to be early detection of the carriers, particularly the asymptomatic people with the help of sensitive and accurate diagnostic techniques. Moreover, developing novel and appropriate therapeutic approaches will contribute to the suitable management of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to make comprehensive investigations and study reviews about COVID-19, offering the latest findings of novel therapies, drugs, epidemiology, and routes of virus transmission and pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss new therapeutic outcomes and cover and the most significant aspects of COVID-19, including the epidemiology, biological features, organs failure, and diagnostic techniques.

N2  - The basic clinical characteristics of the first 100 fatal cases from COVID-19 in Colombia were analyzed based on reports from the National Institute of Health (INS) since the beginning of the pandemic. Since the INS records do not include clinical variables of comorbidity in the total number of cases reported as positive, but only in patients with fatal outcome, comorbidities, age and sex available in the daily INS reports were reviewed. Their frequency was identified and mortality risk behavior for the analyzed variables was established and compared with the behavior described in the international literature. Of the 100 cases, 63 were male, the mean age was 65.75 +/- 18.11 years, and in 22 of them no comorbidity had been reported. The most frequently reported comorbidities were arterial hypertension (35%), diabetes mellitus (21%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (19%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16%), obesity (12%), smoking (9%) and thyroid disease (8%). Patients over 60 years of age presented a higher risk of mortality (OR 10.31, IC95% 6.67-15.94, p < 0.0001). Ten percent of the deceased patients were under 60 years of age and did not present comorbidity.

N2  - Aging is one of the key contributing factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.

N2  - Some debates exist regarding the association of diabetes mellitus (DM) with COVID-19 infection severity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to describe and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DM. In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Shariati hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 25, 2020, to April 21, 2020. The clinical and paraclinical information as well as the clinical outcomes of patients were collected from inpatient medical records. A total of 353 cases were included (mean age, 61.67 years; 57.51 % male), of whom 111 patients were diabetics (mean age, 63.66 years; 55.86 % male). In comparison to those without DM, diabetic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have other comorbidities, elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), elevated blood sugar (BS), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The association of DM with severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection (i.e. mechanical ventilation, median length of hospital stay and mortality) remained non-significant before and after adjustments for several factors including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and comorbidities. Based on our results DM has not been associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 infection. Copyright © 2020 Mansour et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: We describe the presenting characteristics and hospital course of 11 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients who developed spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema (SE) with or without pneumomediastinum (SPM) in the absence of prior mechanical ventilation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 11 non-intubated COVID-19 patients (8 male and 3 female, median age 61 years) developed SE and SPM between March 15 and April 30, 2020 at a multi-center urban health system in New York City. Demographics (age, gender, smoking status, comorbid conditions, and body-mass index), clinical variables (temperature, oxygen saturation, and symptoms), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and peak interleukin-6) were collected. Chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) were analyzed for SE, SPM, and pneumothorax by a board-certified cardiothoracic-fellowship trained radiologist., RESULTS: Eleven non-intubated patients developed SE, 36% (4/11) of whom had SE on their initial CXR. Concomitant SPM was apparent in 91% (10/11) of patients, and 45% (5/11) also developed pneumothorax. Patients developed SE on average 13.3 days (SD: 6.3) following symptom onset. No patients reported a history of smoking. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (6/11), diabetes mellitus (5/11), asthma (3/11), dyslipidemia (3/11), and renal disease (2/11). Four (36%) patients expired during hospitalization., CONCLUSION: SE and SPM were observed in a cohort of 11 non-intubated COVID-19 patients without any known cause or history of invasive ventilation. Further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism in this patient population. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia, anosmia) is a well-recognized symptom in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Studies of olfactory dysfunction in asymptomatic patients have not been reported. We conducted a study looking for the presence of olfactory dysfunction with an objective assessment tool in asymptomatic Covid 19 and compared it with patients with mild COVID-19 and age-matched controls. We recruited 57 male patients each of Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19, and healthy controls for the study. All participants underwent evaluation of smell threshold by Butanol Threshold test (BTT) and ability to distinguish common odors by Smell identification test. The scores of each test were recorded on a numerical scale. The participants in all three arms were matched for age, history of smoking, and pre-existing medical conditions. The mean scores of the Butanol Threshold test in Mild COVID-19, asymptomatic Covid 19 and controls were 2.95 +/- 2.25 (0-7.5), 3.42 +/- 2.23 (0-7.5), and 4.82 +/- 1.86 (0-8), respectively. A one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between groups (df 2, MS 53.78, F 11.94, p < 0.005). Intergroup differences using the student T-test showed significantly low BTT scores in Mild COVID-19 (p < 0.005) and asymptomatic (p < 0.005) as compared to control. BTT scores could not distinguish between asymptomatic patients and control. The smell threshold was impaired in asymptomatic Covid 19 and Mild COVID-19. Butanol Threshold Test score could not differentiate between asymptomatic Covid 19 and controls. Copyright © Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, an up-to-date review of current challenges in addictions is necessary. While large scale disasters may have an impact on substance use and addictions, the use of some substances is also likely to modify the risk of COVID-19 infection or course. Many countries have imposed lockdowns. Whether this quarantine or the end of lockdown measures will have an impact on substance use is discussed. The aim of this review is to gather knowledge for clinicians and to guide public health policies during/after lockdown., METHODS: PubMed was reviewed in August 6th (2020), to determine the current evidences and observations concerning the addictions and SARS-CoV2. We used all the names of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common substances of abuse. For the physiopathological parts, searches were conducted using key words such as "infection" or "pneumonia". For the lockdown effects, key words such as "quarantine", "disaster" or "outbreak" were used., RESULTS: Overall, pathophysiological data showed an increased risk of infections for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and a possible protective role of nicotine. During lockdown, there is a substantial risk of increasing SUDs. Individuals with opioid use disorder are particularly at risk of relapse or of involuntary withdrawal. After lockdown, increase of use may be observed as far as years after. Individuals with addictions are at higher risk of multimorbidity and mortality during COVID outbreak., CONCLUSION: This review describes useful strategies in clinical practice, including a systematic assessment of addiction comorbidity during this almost worldwide lockdown/pandemic. This review also highlights important areas for future research. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Clinical trials represent an essential component of improving treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). The SARS coronavirus-2 pandemic disrupted our ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation and forced us to rapidly implement changes to assure participants access to ongoing counseling and monitoring via telephone calls and/or video chat sessions. Our experiences suggest that this pandemic will lead to changes for both future clinical trial participants and project staff. While challenges remain, it will be important to assessing the impact of these changes with regard to participant experiences and treatment outcomes. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on sexual, mental and physical health. There were 262 respondents included in this study (38% female and 62% male) above 18 years of age from India. Statistical analysis was performed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. The numerical tests were performed by using Python 3 engine and R-squared (coefficient of multiple determinations for multiple regressions) for prediction and P value > 0.5 is considered to be statistically significant. The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the quality of sex life, changes in sexual behavior and mental health. Frequency of sexual intercourse, frequency of watching porn, sexual hygiene, frequency of physical activity, depression, desire for parenthood in female respondents have more significant R 2 (0.903, 0.976, 0.973, 0.989, 0.985, 0.862) value respectively as compared to male respondents. Financial anxiety, Smoking and drinking habits in male respondents have more significant R 2 (0.917, 0.964) value respectively as compared to female respondents. The aim of this study is to understand quality of sex life, sexual behavior, reproductive planning, mental health, physical health and adult coping during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as how past experiences have affected. Many respondents had a broad variety of problems concerning their sexual and reproductive well being. Measures should be set in order to safeguard the mental and sexual health of people during the pandemic. Copyright © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently require mechanical ventilation and have high mortality rates, but the impact of viral burden on these outcomes is unknown., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 30 to April 30, 2020 at two hospitals in New York City. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes among patients with high, medium, and low admission viral loads and assessed whether viral load was independently associated with risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality., RESULTS: We evaluated 678 patients with COVID-19. Higher viral load was associated with increased age, comorbidities, smoking status, and recent chemotherapy. In-hospital mortality was 35.0% with a high viral load (Ct<25; n=220), 17.6% with a medium viral load (Ct 25-30; n=216), and 6.2% with a low viral load (Ct>30; n=242; P<0.001). The risk of intubation was also higher in patients with a high viral load (29.1%), compared to those with a medium (20.8%) or low viral load (14.9%; P<0.001). High viral load was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.92-12.52; P<0.001) and intubation (aOR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.68-4.44; P<0.001) in multivariate models., CONCLUSIONS: Admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independently correlates with the risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Providing this information to clinicians could potentially be used to guide patient care. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide. Limited studies showed that smokers were at higher risk of having severe complications and higher mortality. We aimed to analyze the possible correlation between adult tobacco smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality all over the world., METHODS: this correlation study involved a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020., RESULTS: seventy-five countries included with median CFR 3.66%. There was no relationship between adult male or female smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence, respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there was a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the mortality of COVID-19. Each increment of one percentage of adult male smoking prevalence was associated with increase in COVID-19 CFR by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041)., CONCLUSION: there is correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening of tobacco control policies is essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC. This still warrants further studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of COVID-19., OBJECTIVES: This observational study compared the prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization in IBD patients with a control population with non-inflammatory bowel disorders., METHODS: This multicentre study, included 2733 outpatients (1397 IBD patients and 1336 controls), from eight major gastrointestinal centres in Lombardy, Italy. Patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire regarding demographic, historical and clinical features over the previous 6 weeks. The prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization for COVID-19 was assessed., RESULTS: 1810 patients (64%) responded to the questionnaire (941 IBD patients and 869 controls). IBD patients were significantly younger and of male sex than controls. NSAID use and smoking were more frequent in controls. IBD patients were more likely treated with vitamin-D and vaccinated for influenza. Highly probable COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms and signs was less frequent in the IBD group (3.8% vs 6.3%; OR:0.45, 95%CI:0.28-0.75). IBD patients had a lower rate of nasopharyngeal swab-PCR confirmed diagnosis (0.2% vs 1.2%; OR:0.14, 95%CI:0.03-0.67). There was no difference in hospitalization between the groups (0.1% vs 0.6%; OR:0.14, 95%CI:0.02-1.17)., CONCLUSION: IBD patients do not have an increased risk of COVID-19 specific symptoms or more severe disease compared with a control group of gastroenterology patients.

N2  - To explore the applicability of MuLBSTA Score in COVID-19 patients, a retrospective analysis was performed on 330 cases of COVID-19 patients in Southeast Hospital of Xiaogan City, Hubei Province. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients were described and multilobe infiltrate in CT, bacterial infection, lymphocyte count, smoke in history, history of hypertension, and age distribution in the population of mild and severe patients were analyzed. All included patients were scored according to the MuLBSTA early warning scoring system and its efficacy in early warning of severe symptoms was analyzed. CT feature of infiltration changes on multiple lobes, the absolute value of lymphocyte count of less than 0.8 x 109, accompanied by bacterial infection, history of smoking, history of hypertension, and an age of greater than 60 years old were all statistically significant factors in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis indicated that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the early warning system were 0.651, 0.954 and 0.93, respectively. The MuLBSTA Score has a good early warning effect on severe COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Schools are increasingly concerned with the well-being of the whole child - likely, more so since the COVID-19 pandemic - and goals here were to document the psychometric properties of a brief new measure of adolescent mental health, the Well-Being Index (WBI). The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

N2  - (1) Background: Nicotine is implicated in the SARS-COV-2 infection through activation of the alpha7-nAChR and over-expression of ACE2. Our objective was to clarify the role of nicotine in SARS-CoV-2 infection exploring its molecular and cellular activity. (2) Methods: HBEpC or si-mRNA-alpha7-HBEpC were treated for 1 h, 48 h or continuously with 10-7 M nicotine, a concentration mimicking human exposure to a cigarette. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting, migration by cell migration assay, senescence by SA-beta-Gal activity, and anchorage-independent growth by cloning in soft agar. Expression of Ki67, p53/phospho-p53, VEGF, EGFR/pEGFR, phospho-p38, intracellular Ca2+, ATP and EMT were evaluated by ELISA and/or Western blotting. (3) Results: nicotine induced through alpha7-nAChR (i) increase in cell viability, (ii) cell proliferation, (iii) Ki67 over-expression, (iv) phospho-p38 up-regulation, (v) EGFR/pEGFR over-expression, (vi) increase in basal Ca2+ concentration, (vii) reduction of ATP production, (viii) decreased level of p53/phospho-p53, (ix) delayed senescence, (x) VEGF increase, (xi) EMT and consequent (xii) enhanced migration, and (xiii) ability to grow independently of the substrate. (4) Conclusions: Based on our results and on evidence showing that nicotine potentiates viral infection, it is likely that nicotine is involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with lung cancers may have disproportionately severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Understanding the patient-specific and cancer-specific features that impact the severity of COVID-19 may inform optimal cancer care during this pandemic., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with lung cancer and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 102) at a single center from 12 March 2020 to 6 May 2020. Thresholds of severity were defined a priori as hospitalization, intensive care unit/intubation/do not intubate ([ICU/intubation/DNI] a composite metric of severe disease), or death. Recovery was defined as >14 days from COVID-19 test and >3 days since symptom resolution. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were inferred from MSK-IMPACT (n = 46) and compared with controls with lung cancer and no known non-COVID-19 (n = 5166)., RESULTS: COVID-19 was severe in patients with lung cancer (62% hospitalized, 25% died). Although severe, COVID-19 accounted for a minority of overall lung cancer deaths during the pandemic (11% overall). Determinants of COVID-19 severity were largely patient-specific features, including smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [odds ratio for severe COVID-19 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.07-9.44 comparing the median (23.5 pack-years) to never-smoker and 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.35-9.68, respectively]. Cancer-specific features, including prior thoracic surgery/radiation and recent systemic therapies did not impact severity. Human leukocyte antigen supertypes were generally similar in mild or severe cases of COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Most patients recovered from COVID-19, including 25% patients initially requiring intubation. Among hospitalized patients, hydroxychloroquine did not improve COVID-19 outcomes., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with high burden of severity in patients with lung cancer. Patient-specific features, rather than cancer-specific features or treatments, are the greatest determinants of severity. Copyright © 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to dramatic changes in oncology practice. It is currently unknown whether programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade therapy affects severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity on the basis of no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter. Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status. After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. PD-1 blockade does not appear to affect the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: A key question in oncology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is whether PD-1 blockade therapy affects COVID-19 severity. Our analysis of patients with lung cancers supports the safety of PD-1 blockade treatment to achieve optimal cancer outcomes. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.

N2  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting the human respiratory system severely challenges public health and urgently demands for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and replication. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Health information about COVID-19 has been circulating in social networking sites, including unproven claims that smoking and alcohol drinking could protect against COVID-19. We examined if exposure to such claims was associated with changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption., METHODS: We conducted a population-based, landline and mobile phone survey of 1501 randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older (47.5% male) in Hong Kong in April 2020. Respondents reported if they had ever seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from popular social networking platforms. Current tobacco and alcohol users reported if they had increased or reduced their consumption since the outbreak. Prevalence data were weighted by sex, age and education of the general adult population., RESULTS: 19.0% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.4%) of all respondents reported having seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from social networking sites. Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95% CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method., CONCLUSION: Our results first showed that exposure to health misinformation that smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19 was associated with self-reported increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Chinese during the pandemic.

T1  - PDE4 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for improvement of pulmonary dysfunctions in Covid-19 and cigarette smoking.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the binding-site and entry-point for SARS-CoV-2 in human and highly expressed in the lung. Cigarette smoking (CS) is the leading cause of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic CS leads to upregulation of bronchial ACE2 inducing a high vulnerability in COVID-19 smoker patients. Interestingly, CS-induced dysregulation of pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in part contributing into the potential pathogenesis COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, CS-mediated ACE2 activations is not the main pathway for increasing the risk of COVID-19, it appeared that AngII/AT1R might induce an inflammatory-burst in COVID-19 response by up-regulating cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which hydrolyses specifically the second intracellular messenger 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP). It must be pointed out that CS might induce PDE4 up-regulation similarly to the COVID-19 inflammation, and therefore could potentiate COVID-19 inflammation opening the potential therapeutic effects of PDE4 inhibitor in both COVID-19-inflammation and CS.

N2  - Morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is age-dependent. It remains unclear whether vertical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs during pregnancy and how such infection will affect fetal development. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of placenta and other tissues from fetuses in comparison with those from adults using public-available datasets. Our analysis revealed that a very small proportion of trophoblast cells expressed the Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, suggesting a low possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus during pregnancy. We found that the fetal adrenal gland, heart, kidney and stomach were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, because these organs contained cell clusters that expressed high levels of the ACE2 gene. In particular, a higher proportion of ACE2-expressing cell clusters in the adrenal gland and kidney also expressed the Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) gene compared with other organs. Surprisingly, ACE2-expressing type II alveolar (AT2) equivalent cells were absent in fetal lungs. This is in sharp contrast to adult lungs. As ACE2 expression is regulated by various conditions, including oxygen concentration, inflammation and smoking, caution is warranted to avoid triggering potential ACE2 expression in fetal and placental tissue.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, which was earliest reported in Wuhan, China, is now transmitting throughout the world. The aim of this study was to articulate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and to reveal possible factors that may affect the persistent time of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, so as to identify which patients may deteriorate or have poor prognoses as early as possible., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was carried out on 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to XinYu People's Hospital of JiangXi Province. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratorial, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed., RESULTS: In this study, patients were divided into two groups based on whether their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in respiratory specimens turn negative within (Group Rapid or Group R) or over (Group Slow or Group S) a week. There was no significant difference in age, sex, travel or exposure history, and smoking history between the two groups. Forty-two patients had been observed with comorbidities. Similar clinical manifestations, for instance fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue, have been observed among patients in both groups, except that patients in Group S were obviously more likely to get fatigue than patients in Group R. Both groups had shown decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte counts. Chest X-ray or computed tomography scan showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. High proportion in both groups has used nasal cannula (89.47% vs. 85.71%) to inhale oxygen. 10.53% of Group S have applied high-flow nasal cannula, while Group R used none. The current treatment is mainly antibiotics, antiviral, and traditional Chinese medicine, while a couple of patients has used methylprednisolone. Only 1 patient out of both groups got even worse despite this active treatment., CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include the exposure history and typical systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts, and infiltration in both lower lobes on CT imaging. Among them, fatigue appears to be an important factor that affects the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in respiratory specimens. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.

N2  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19. In response, most affected countries have enacted measures involving compulsory confinement and restrictions on free movement, which likely influence citizens' lifestyles. This study investigates changes in health risk behaviors (HRBs) with duration of confinement. An online cross-sectional survey served to collect data about the Spanish adult population regarding health behaviors during the first 3 weeks of confinement. A large sample of participants (N = 2,741) (51.8% women; mean age 34.2 years [SD 13.0]) from all Spanish regions completed the survey. Binomial logistic regressions adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, civil status, education, and occupation), body mass index (BMI), previous HRBs, and confinement context (i.e., solitude and exposure to COVID-19) were conducted to investigate associations between the number of weeks confined and a set of six HRBs (physical activity, alcohol consumption, fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours). When adjusted, we observed significantly lower odds of experiencing a higher number of HRBs than before confinement overall in a time-dependent fashion: OR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49-0.81 for the second and OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36-0.61 for the third week of confinement. These results were equally consistent in all age and gender subgroup analyses. The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each HRB except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of COVID-19 confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent worldwide, and its individual components obesity, diabetes, and hypertension have been identified as risk factors to develop severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, data on MetS and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 are scarce. This study aims to determine association between MetS and severe disease outcomes, that is, mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) requirement among patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This is a retrospective multihospital cohort study on 1871 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Patient data including demographics, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), smoking, laboratory data, and the clinical course of hospitalization were collected. Multivariable regression was performed adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance, smoking, and comorbidities., RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (median age 66 [interquartile range, IQR 54-75]; 965 (51.6%) males; 1494 (80%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 kg/m2 [IQR 25-35.8]; 573 (30.6%) patients with MetS) were included. Patients with MetS had increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75; P = .004), higher ICU admission (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.36-2.08; P < .001), and increased need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.37; P < .001). Among individual comorbidities, diabetes had significant association with mortality (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = 0.02), ICU admission (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.93; P < .001), and need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.03; P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: MetS is a better prognostic indicator for severe disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19 than its individual components. Patients with MetS had significantly higher mortality, increased ICU admissions, and need for mechanical ventilation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Comorbidities play a key role in severe disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID-19, accounting for other possible confounders, is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. During statistical analysis, possible confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities including, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, any history of cancer and prior liver disease, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke, were accounted for., RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (mean (SD) age, 64.11 (16) years; 965(51.6%) males; 1494 (79.9%) African Americans; 809 (43.2%) with >= 3 comorbidities) were included in the study. During their stay at the hospital, 613 patients (32.8%) died, 489 (26.1%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 592 (31.6%) required ICU admission. In fully adjusted models, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR), 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72; p = 0.01), higher rate of ICU admission (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.68; p = 0.009) and increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; p = 0.01). Additionally, patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55; p = 0.03) in fully adjusted models., CONCLUSION: Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes, in COVID-19 patients. These results can help facilitate efficient resource allocation for critical care services.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia., METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression., RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, chi = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]degreeC, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, chi = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 +/- 6.60 vs. 41.27 +/- 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (chi = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression., CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The number of deaths worldwide caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing rapidly. Information about the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to hospital is limited. Some risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 are controversial (eg, smoking). Moreover, the impact of city closure on mortality and admission rates is unknown., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 infection among a sample of patients in Wuhan whose conditions were reported on social media., METHODS: We enrolled 599 patients with COVID-19 from 67 hospitals in Wuhan in the study; 117 of the participants (19.5%) were not admitted to hospital. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of the patients were extracted from their social media posts and coded. Telephone follow-up was conducted 1 month later (between March 15 and 23, 2020) to check the clinical outcomes of the patients and acquire other relevant information., RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 who died (72 years, IQR 66.5-82.0) was significantly higher than that of patients who recovered (61 years, IQR 53-69, P<.001). We found that lack of admission to hospital (odds ratio [OR] 5.82, 95% CI 3.36-10.1; P<.001), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.1; P<.001), diffuse distribution (OR 11.09, 95% CI 0.93-132.9; P=.058), and hypoxemia (odds ratio 2.94, 95% CI 1.32-6.6; P=.009) were associated with increasing odds of death. Smoking was not significantly associated with mortality risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.44-1.85; P=.78)., CONCLUSIONS: Older age, diffuse distribution, and hypoxemia are factors that can help clinicians identify patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis. Our study suggests that aggregated data from social media can also be comprehensive, immediate, and informative in disease prognosis.

N2  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a target for disease prevention. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and its clinical implications in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we explored the location and expression of ACE2, and its correlation with gender, age, and cigarette smoke (CS), in a CS-exposed mouse model and 224 non-malignant lung tissues (125 non-smokers, 81 current smokers, and 18 ex-smokers) by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the correlations of ACE2 with CS-induced oxidative stress-related markers, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS-exposed mouse lungs. Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex-smokers compared with current smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF-1alpha, iNOS, and 4-HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles. The results were further validated using a publicly available dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our previous integrated data from Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray (AE-meta). Finally, our results showed that HIF-1alpha transcriptionally upregulates ACE2 expression. Our results indicate that smoking-induced ACE2 overexpression in the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells provides a route by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells, which supports clinical relevance in attenuating the potential transmission risk of COVID-19 in smoking populations by smoking cessation. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) depend on disease severity, but the prescribing pattern by severity and drivers of therapeutic choices remain unclear., OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19., METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged >= 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen <= 2, 3-4, and >= 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization., RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of disease severity and other determinants of COVID-19 drug use is necessary for appropriate conduct and interpretation of non-randomized studies evaluating outcomes of COVID-19 treatments.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption., METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread throughout the world. It has been reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is one of the major cellular entry receptors of SARS-CoV-2; thus, high ACE2 expression may increase susceptibility to infection. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in the blood to identify the individuals who may be susceptible to infection. Methods: In total, 229 subjects were enrolled in this study, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA assay was used to identify the level of ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein level in the blood. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, gender, weight, height, smoking habits, drinking habits, diabetes, and hypertension, were obtained using a face-to-face questionnaire. Independent Student's t-test, Pearson's linear correlation, logistic regression analysis, and multiple linear regression correlation were performed to assess the association between these factors and the expression of ACE2. Results: Higher level of ACE2 was observed in females, older subjects, subjects with hypertension, subjects with a cardiocerebrovascular disease, male smokers, and subjects with cancer (p < 0.05) than in other subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that there is a statistically significant correlation between being a female and ACE2 expression (beta = 0.550, p < 0.001), between older age and ACE2 expression (beta = 0.197, p = 0.003), between smoking and ACE2 expression (beta = 0.163, p = 0.037), and between cancer and ACE2 expression (beta = 0.265, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that female subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 2.255, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.770-2.872), subjects with hypertension (OR = 1.264, 95% CI = 1.075-1.486), subjects with a cardiocerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.271, 95% CI = 1.023-1.579), subjects with cancer (OR = 1.695, 95% CI = 1.253-2.293), and subjects above 60 years of age (OR = 3.097, 95% CI = 1.078-8.896) are at an increased risk of infection due to their high expression of ACE2. Conclusion:  The level of ACE2 is higher in females, older subjects, smokers, and subjects with cancer than in other subjects, indicating that some of which are at higher risk for the severe forms of COVID-19 when they are exposed to the SARS-Cov-2.

N2  - The COVID-19 virus has infected more than 38 million people and resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide as of October 14, 2020. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, economic inequality enhanced the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The per capita hospital beds correlated negatively with COVID-19 deaths. Blood types B and AB were protective factors for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV and influenza and pneumonia was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Increased intake of vegetables, edible oil, protein, vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk, while increased intake of alcohol was associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included age, sex, temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, health investment, urbanization level, and race. High temperature is a more compelling factor mitigating COVID-19 transmission than low temperature. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new pneumonia. It has been hypothesized that tobacco smoking history may increase severity of this disease in the patients once infected by the underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 because smoking and COVID-19 both cause lung damage. However, this hypothesis has not been tested., OBJECTIVE: Current study was designed to focus on smoking history in patients with COVID-19 and test this hypothesis that tobacco smoking history increases risk for severe COVID-19 by damaging the lungs., METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a single-site, retrospective case series study of clinical associations, between epidemiological findings and clinical manifestations, radiographical or laboratory results. In our well-characterized cohort of 954 patients including 56 with tobacco smoking history, smoking history increased the risk for severe COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.5 (95% CI: 3.1-9.9; P = 7.3 x 10-8 ). Meta-analysis of ten cohorts for 2891 patients together obtained an OR of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.9-3.3; P < 0.00001). Semi-quantitative analysis of lung images for each of five lobes revealed a significant difference in neither lung damage at first examination nor dynamics of the lung damage at different time-points of examinations between the smoking and nonsmoking groups. No significant differences were found either in laboratory results including D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels except different covariances for density of the immune cells lymphocyte (P = 3.8 x 10-64 ) and neutrophil (P = 3.9 x 10-46 )., CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoking history increases the risk for great severity of COVID-19 but this risk is achieved unlikely by affecting the lungs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, outcomes and the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia., METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases and compared severe (ICU) and nonsevere (non-ICU) groups., RESULTS: We included 12 cohort studies including 2,445 patients with COVID-19. Compared with nonsevere (non-ICU) patients, severe (ICU) disease was associated with a smoking history (P=.003) and comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=5.08, P < .001), diabetes (OR=3.17, P < .001), hypertension (OR=2.40, P < .001), coronary heart disease (OR=2.66, P < .001), cerebrovascular diseases (OR=2.68, P=.008), and malignancy (OR=2.21, P=.040). We found significant differences between the 2 groups for fever, dyspnea, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, and increased leukocyte count, C-creative protein, procalcitonin, lactose dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, and creatinine levels (P < .05). Significant differences were also observed for multiple treatments (P < .05). Patients in the severe (ICU) group were more likely to have complications and had a much higher mortality rate and lower discharge rate than those with nonsevere (non-ICU) disease (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe cases of COVID-19 will contribute to early prediction, accurate diagnosis, and treatment to improve the prognosis of patients with severe illness.

N2  - It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Existing literature indicated electronic cigarette users (vapers) have impaired immune response that might increase vulnerability to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. However, whether vapers are more susceptible to COVID-19 is unknown. Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureau and the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of statewide e-cigarette use prevalence with number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US on a state level from January 21, 2020 to April 25, 2020. The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554-0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3730 (95% CI: 0.0815-0.6646) in log scale in each US state. The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each US state in this ecological study suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 on a state level and warrants further investigation.

N2  - Since COVID-19 spread rapidly worldwide, many countries have experienced significant growth in the number of confirmed cases and deaths. Earlier studies have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19, such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature. As there is a lack of studies at the neighborhood-level detailing the spatial settings of built environment attributes, this study explored the variations in the size of the COVID-19 confirmed case clusters across the urban district Huangzhou in the city of Huanggang. Clusters of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed cases in an infectious cluster. The clues ch inducing a high risk of contagions have been evidenced and provided for the decision-making practice responding to the initial stage of possible severe epidemics, indicating that the local public health authorities should implement sufficient measures and adopt effective interventions in the areas and places with a high probability of crowded residents.

N2  - We studied sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, gender, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of the outbreak, lockdowns, viral testing, contact-tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of the outbreak in the country, and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, whereas duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all P < 0.001). Obesity and less stringent international travel restrictions were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. Internal lockdown was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4% reduction in mortality each week (P = 0.83). The association of contact-tracing policy with mortality was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries. Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers., RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

T1  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-encoded ORF8b strongly antagonizes IFN-beta promoter activation: its implication for vaccine design.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a causative agent of severe-to-fatal pneumonia especially in patients with pre-existing conditions, such as smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MERS-CoV transmission continues to be reported in the Saudi Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 2012. However, it has rarely been epidemic outside the area except one large outbreak in South Korea in May 2015. The genome of the epidemic MERS-CoV isolated from a Korean patient revealed its homology to previously reported strains. MERS-CoV encodes 5 accessory proteins and generally, they do not participate in the genome transcription and replication but rather are involved in viral evasion of the host innate immune responses. Here we report that ORF8b, an accessory protein of MERS-CoV, strongly inhibits both MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated activation of interferon beta promoter activity while downstream signaling molecules were left largely unaffected. Of note, MDA5 protein levels were significantly down-regulated by ORF8b and co-expression of ORF4a and ORF4b. These novel findings will facilitate elucidation of mechanisms of virus-encoded evasion strategies, thus helping design rationale antiviral countermeasures against deadly MERS-CoV infection.

T1  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-Encoded Accessory Proteins Impair MDA5-and TBK1-Mediated Activation of NF-kappaB.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging coronavirus which is zoonotic from bats and camels. Its infection in humans can be fatal especially in patients with preexisting conditions due to smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Among the 25 proteins encoded by MERS-CoV, 5 accessory proteins seem to be involved in viral evasion of the host immune responses. Here we report that ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF8b proteins, alone or in combination, effectively antagonize nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. Interestingly, the inhibition of NF-kappaB by MERS-CoV accessory proteins was mostly at the level of pattern recognition receptors: melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5). ORF4a and ORF4b additively inhibit MDA5-mediated activation of NF-kappaB while that of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) is largely not perturbed. Of note, ORF8b was found to be a novel antagonist of MDA5-mediated NF-kkappaB activation. In addition, ORF8b also strongly inhibits Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated induction of NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, MERS-CoV accessory proteins are involved in viral escape of NF-kappaB-mediated antiviral immune responses.

N2  - The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing severe acute respiratory disease pandemic COVID-19. Tissue and cellular tropism is one key to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), within the upper (nasal) and lower (pulmonary) respiratory tracts of human donors using a diverse panel of banked tissues. Here, we report our discovery that the ACE2 receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission. We further determine whether ciliary ACE2 expression in the upper airway is influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, or medication use, and show the first mechanistic evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) does not increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection through enhancing the expression of ciliary ACE2 receptor. These findings are crucial to our understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for prevention and control of this virulent pathogen.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to COVID-19.

Exposures: Ethnicity classified as White, Black, Asian, and Others. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission in England from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020., RESULTS: There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of being hospitalised (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: =4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the Other non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for 15 confounding factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, education, number in household, smoking, markers of body size, inflammation, and glycated haemoglobin, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings show clear ethnic differences in risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 which do not appear to be fully explained by known explanatory factors. If replicated, our results have implications for health policy, including the targeting of prevention advice and vaccination coverage.

T1  - Lifestyle factors in the prevention of COVID-19.

N2  - Confinement to the home and psychological distress due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to harmful health behaviors, such as overeating, sedentary behavior with reduced physical activity, elevated alcohol and tobacco use and increased screen time causing impaired sleep. All of these behaviors are associated with non-communicable diseases and can interfere with immunity. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. High-energy "Western" diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Alcohol use and tobacco also have detrimental effects on the immune system. Therefore, population-wide body weight control, reduction of smoking rates and limitation of alcohol consumption are important preventive measures. Furthermore, sufficient restorative sleep is needed for adequate immune functioning. Appropriate lifestyle changes in regard to nutrition, exercise, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake may help shift the population distribution of infection risk and aid in preventing severe COVID-19 disease. Large-scale surveys should explore the effects of lifestyle changes, and the provision of reliable lifestyle information and effective interventions to individuals and communities during the pandemic is a pressing need.

T1  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Smoking: How and Why We Implemented a Tobacco Treatment Campaign.
A1  - Lang, Adam Edward
A1  - Yakhkind, Aleksandra
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Smoking is associated with one of five deaths in the United States. Multimodality tobacco treatment increases rates of successful cessation by at least 20%. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has put a halt to many inpatient and outpatient medical visits that have been deemed nonessential, including tobacco treatment. The transition to telehealth has been wrought with challenges. Although data on the association between coronavirus disease 2019 and tobacco products are mixed, the overall health consequences of tobacco point towards increased risk of morbidity and death that is associated with the virus. This leaves smoking as one of the few readily modifiable risk factors in an environment understandably not set up to prioritize cessation. A military health facility on Fort Eustis in Virginia runs a successful tobacco treatment program and adapted it to pandemic times. This article describes the process and lessons learned from this initiative. The model is applicable and scalable to government and civilian health centers as health care adapts to a new normal.

N2  - Background and aim of the work The effect of tobacco smoking on COVID-19 disease is debated with common sense and experts suggesting a deleterious effect and manuscripts worldwide reporting a low prevalence of active tobacco smokers among intensive care unit patients. Methods We categorized countries worldwide into three groups with <25%; 25-45%; >45% of active male smokers with data expressed as median and interquartile range [IQR] and extracted data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths per million inhabitants. We also applied multivariate regression techniques to adjust for several epidemiological factors. Results COVID-19 mortality was 13 (5-24) per million inhabitants in countries with male smokers >45% and 33 (4-133) in countries where male smokers were <25%. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 436 (217-954) and 1139 (302-4084) with data confirmed when dividing data for each continent and when controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions We found a counterintuitive low COVID-19 mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection in countries with high prevalence of male smokers at the global level and within each continent, suggesting that active smoking habit is protective. Further research should urgently investigate which is the possible mechanism of action.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a "toxin-like" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human alpha7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the "toxin-like" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human alpha7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Data on patients with COVID-19 who have cancer are lacking. Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness., METHODS: In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing., FINDINGS: Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.53-2.21), male sex (1.63, 1.07-2.48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1.60, 1.03-2.47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4.50, 1.33-15.28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3.89, 2.11-7.18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5.20, 2.77-9.77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2.93, 1.79-4.79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0.24, 0.07-0.84) or the US-Midwest (0.50, 0.28-0.90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality., INTERPRETATION: Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with cancer, including the ability to continue specific cancer treatments., FUNDING: American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, and Hope Foundation for Cancer Research.

N2  - Now COVID-19 is causing a severe public health emergency and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the world. In the current pandemic era, although there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts, there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore, many patients have been dying due to a hyperinflammatory immunological reaction labeled as "cytokine storm". Severe patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done, though they have not been established yet. Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients. In this review, we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with COVID-19, which should help reducing morbidity and mortality. In this era, we suggest 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 based on the immunological point of view. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic considerably affects health, wellbeing, social, economic and other aspects of daily life. The impact of COVID-19 on blood pressure (BP) control and hypertension remains insufficiently explored. We therefore provide a comprehensive review of the potential changes in lifestyle factors and behaviours as well as environmental changes likely to influence BP control and cardiovascular risk during the pandemic. This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise. We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has highlighted the need for improved surveillance and understanding of the health burden imposed by non-influenza RNA respiratory viruses. Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with associated morbidity and mortality., OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to characterize the epidemiology of CoVs in our tertiary care centre, and identify clinical correlates of disease severity., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality., RESULTS: CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%. In a multivariate model, female gender and smoking were associated with increased likelihood of admission to ICU or death., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant burden of CoVs and justifies the need for surveillance in the acute care setting.

N2  - Combustible tobacco users appear to be at greater risk for serious complications from COVID-19. This study examined cigar smokers' perceived risk of COVID-19, quit intentions, and behaviors during the current pandemic. We conducted an online study between 23 April 2020 to 7 May 2020, as part of an ongoing study examining perceptions of different health effects of cigars. All participants used cigars in the past 30 days (n = 777). Three-quarters of the sample (76.0%) perceived they had a higher risk of complications from COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. The majority of participants (70.8%) intended to quit in the next six months due to COVID-19, and almost half of the sample (46.5%) reported making a quit attempt since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Far more participants reported increasing their tobacco use since COVID-19 started (40.9%) vs. decreasing their tobacco use (17.8%). Black or African American participants, participants who reported using a quitline, and participants with higher COVID-19 risk perceptions had higher intentions to quit using tobacco due to COVID-19, and higher odds of making a quit attempt since COVID-19 started. More research is needed to understand how tobacco users are perceiving COVID-19 risks and changing their tobacco use behaviors.

N2  - The effect of systemic corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. While the use of corticosteroids raises concerns regarding delayed viral clearance, secondary infections, and long-term complications that can lead to increased mortality, corticosteroids have the potential to reduce mortality if used appropriately. Herein, we report good outcomes in two patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. An 83-year-old man with hypertension and smoking history and a 62-year-old man with a drinking habit were transferred to our hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients developed general malaise and loss of appetite with persistent high fever. Despite the prescription of antiviral drugs, their hypoxemia progressed rapidly. However, after the introduction of systemic corticosteroids, their symptoms improved as the fever decreased, and their hypoxemia gradually improved. These results suggest that some patients with COVID-19 may benefit from the appropriate use of systemic corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already evolved into a rapidly expanding pandemic. Risk factors for COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly associated with smoking habits. The effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed. Emerging data indicate that smoking history is the major determinant of worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as a public health measure to limit the global impact of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020, Radcliffe Cardiology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists. EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom)., METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine., RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform "Screening adviser" to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement. The presented SWOT-analysis of this ongoing implementation process allows to plan and optimize future steps towards a state based and supports EBS program in Ukraine.

N2  - Background: Up to 50% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients do not receive recommended care for COPD. To address this issue, we developed Proactive Integrated Care (Proactive iCare), a health care delivery model that couples integrated care with remote monitoring., Methods: We conducted a prospective, quasi-randomized clinical trial in 511 patients with advanced COPD or a recent COPD exacerbation, to test whether Proactive iCare impacts patient-centered outcomes and health care utilization. Patients were allocated to Proactive iCare (n=352) or Usual Care ( =159) and were examined for changes in quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), symptoms, guideline-based care, and health care utilization., Findings: Proactive iCare improved total SGRQ by 7-9 units (p < 0.0001), symptom SGRQ by 9 units (p<0.0001), activity SGRQ by 6-7 units (p<0.001) and impact SGRQ by 7-11 units (p<0.0001) at 3, 6 and 9 months compared with Usual Care. Proactive iCare increased the 6-minute walk distance by 40 m (p<0.001), reduced annual COPD-related urgent office visits by 76 visits per 100 participants (p<0.0001), identified unreported exacerbations, and decreased smoking (p=0.01). Proactive iCare also improved symptoms, the body mass index-airway obstruction-dyspnea-exercise tolerance (BODE) index and oxygen titration (p<0.05). Mortality in the Proactive iCare group (1.1%) was not significantly different than mortality in the Usual Care group (3.8%; p=0.08)., Interpretation: Linking integrated care with remote monitoring improves the lives of people with advanced COPD, findings that may have been made more relevant by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With the continued spread of COVID-19 in the United States, identifying potential outbreaks before infected individuals cross the clinical threshold is key to allowing public health officials time to ensure local health care institutions are adequately prepared. In response to this need, researchers have developed participatory surveillance technologies that allow individuals to report emerging symptoms daily so that their data can be extrapolated and disseminated to local health care authorities., OBJECTIVE: This study uses a framework synthesis to evaluate existing self-reported symptom tracking programs in the United States for COVID-19 as an early-warning tool for probable clusters of infection. This in turn will inform decision makers and health care planners about these technologies and the usefulness of their information to aid in federal, state, and local efforts to mobilize effective current and future pandemic responses., METHODS: Programs were identified through keyword searches and snowball sampling, then screened for inclusion. A best fit framework was constructed for all programs that met the inclusion criteria by collating information collected from each into a table for easy comparison., RESULTS: We screened 8 programs; 6 were included in our final framework synthesis. We identified multiple common data elements, including demographic information like race, age, gender, and affiliation (all were associated with universities, medical schools, or schools of public health). Dissimilarities included collection of data regarding smoking status, mental well-being, and suspected exposure to COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Several programs currently exist that track COVID-19 symptoms from participants on a semiregular basis. Coordination between symptom tracking program research teams and local and state authorities is currently lacking, presenting an opportunity for collaboration to avoid duplication of efforts and more comprehensive knowledge dissemination.

N2  - Understanding behavioral responses to epidemics is important in evaluating the broad health consequences of emerging infectious diseases. Building on the economic epidemiology literature, this study investigates individual behavioral responses to the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Korea using a panel of individuals in a nationally representative survey. Results show that exposure to the epidemic led to lasting impacts on smoking and drinking behaviors, indicating that emerging infectious disease outbreaks are motivations for behavioral changes and opportunities for public policy interventions. In particular, individuals in the hardest-hit regions or socially connected persons were more likely to change their risky behaviors, suggesting that intensity of exposure and social interactions are potential mechanisms.

T1  - How nicotine can inhibit cytokine storm in the lungs and prevent or lessen the severity of COVID-19 infection?.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Statistical surveys of COVID-19 patients indicate, against all common logic, that people who smoke are less prone to the infection and/or exhibit less severe respiratory symptoms than non-smokers. This suggests that nicotine may have some preventive or modulatory effect on the inflammatory response in the lungs. Because it is known that the response to, and resolution of the SARS-CoV-2 infection depends mainly on the lung macrophages, we discuss the recent scientific findings, which may explain why and how nicotine may modulate lung macrophage response during COVID-19 infection.

T1  - The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19: the villain or the hero?.
A1  - Klhufek, Josef
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is the entry receptor for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19. At the same time, ACE 2 expression decreases during COVID-19. Two seemingly contradictory relationships between the expression of ACE 2 and COVID-19 have been reported. Increased level of expression of ACE 2 may be a risk factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, while reduced ACE 2 expression during COVID-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive overview of available scientific knowledge about the role of ACE 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which is available up to current day. Also, it discusses unknown factors that we will have to reveal in order to understand the whole role of ACE 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

N2  - E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury was recognized in the United States in the summer of 2019 and is typified by acute respiratory distress, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and fever, associated with vaping. It can mimic many of the manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some investigators have suggested that E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury was due to tetrahydrocannabinol or vitamin E acetate oil mixed with the electronic cigarette liquid. In experimental rodent studies initially designed to study the effect of electronic cigarette use on the cardiovascular system, we observed an E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury-like condition that occurred acutely after use of a nichrome heating element at high power, without the use of tetrahydrocannabinol, vitamin E, or nicotine. Lung lesions included thickening of the alveolar wall with foci of inflammation, red blood cell congestion, obliteration of alveolar spaces, and pneumonitis in some cases; bronchi showed accumulation of fibrin, inflammatory cells, and mucus plugs. Electronic cigarette users should be cautioned about the potential danger of operating electronic cigarette units at high settings; the possibility that certain heating elements may be deleterious; and that E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury may not be dependent upon tetrahydrocannabinol, vitamin E, or nicotine.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in a change in life routines for tobacco users, but little is known about the rationale underlying these changes. Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss. Few mentioned wanting to quit due to the pandemic. Discussion: Current tobacco users have experienced major changes in their tobacco use routines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Previous studies demonstrated a higher COVID-19 fatality rate in men. The aim of this study was to compare age and comorbidities between women and men who died from COVID-19. We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1 and May 9, 2020. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independently significant variables associated with gender in patients who died from COVID-19. The model was adjusted for age and comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 mortality. We identified 6760 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these patients, 3018/6760 (44.6%) were women. The mortality rate was higher for men (women 18.2% vs. men 20.6%, p = 0.039). Of the patients who died, women were on average 5 years older than men (woman 77.4 +/- 12.7 vs. men 72.4 +/- 13.0, p < 0.001). In the multivariable model, cardiovascular comorbidities were not significantly different between women and men. Chronic kidney disease (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and smoking (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) were more common in men. Age decile (aOR for women 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and obesity (aOR for women 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-3.0) were higher in women. This study demonstrates that women who died of COVID-19 showed a similar cardiovascular disease profile as men. Yet, they are 5 years older than men. Investigating the gender impacts of COVID-19 is an important part of understanding the disease behavior. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread, and younger patients are also being critically affected. This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than 50., METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1, 2020, and May 17, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI, and smoking status. Obesity groups included the following: BMI of 30 to < 40 kg/m2 and BMI >= 40 kg/m2 . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50., RESULTS: Overall, 3,406 patients were included; 572 (17.0%) patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI >= 40 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 5.1; 95% CI: 2.3-11.1). For the older population, BMI >= 40 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (adjusted odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3)., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with severe obesity are more likely to die of COVID-19. This is particularly relevant in the Western world, where obesity rates are high. Copyright © 2020 The Obesity Society.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern that can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical, based on disease severity. Since the identification of critical patients is crucial for developing effective management strategies, we evaluated clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment provided, and oxygenation to identify potential predictors of mortality among critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients. We retrospectively utilized data from seven critical patients who were admitted to our hospital during April 2020 and required mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was to clarify potential predictor of mortality. All patients were older than 70 years, five were men, six had hypertension, and three ultimately died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors tended to be never smokers (0 pack-years vs. 30 pack-years, p = 0.08), to have higher body mass index (31.3 kg/m2 vs. 25.3 kg/m2, p = 0.06), to require earlier tracheal intubation after symptom onset (2.7 days vs. 5.5 days, p = 0.07), and had fewer lymphocytes on admission (339 /muL vs. 518 /muL, p = 0.05). During the first week after tracheal intubation, non-survivors displayed lower values for minimum ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P/F ratio) (44 mmHg vs. 122 mmHg, p < 0.01) and poor response to intensive therapy compared with survivors. In summary, we show that obesity and lymphopenia could predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and that the trend of lower P/F ratio during the first week of mechanical ventilation could provide useful prognostic information.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics-baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms., METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)., RESULTS: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning model comprising simple patient-provided characteristics, which can efficiently predict the need for intensive care among patients with COVID-19.

N2  - The first reported U.S. case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected in January 2020 (1). As of June 15, 2020, approximately 2 million cases and 115,000 COVID-19-associated deaths have been reported in the United States.* Reports of U.S. patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) describe high proportions of older, male, and black persons (2-4). Similarly, when comparing hospitalized patients with catchment area populations or nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, high proportions have underlying conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or chronic respiratory disease (3,4). For this report, data were abstracted from the medical records of 220 hospitalized and 311 nonhospitalized patients aged >=18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from six acute care hospitals and associated outpatient clinics in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify patient characteristics associated with hospitalization. The following characteristics were independently associated with hospitalization: age >=65 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4), black race (aOR = 3.2), having diabetes mellitus (aOR = 3.1), lack of insurance (aOR = 2.8), male sex (aOR = 2.4), smoking (aOR = 2.3), and obesity (aOR = 1.9). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe outcomes, including death, and measures to protect persons from infection, such as staying at home, social distancing (5), and awareness and management of underlying conditions should be emphasized for those at highest risk for hospitalization with COVID-19. Measures that prevent the spread of infection to others, such as wearing cloth face coverings (6), should be used whenever possible to protect groups at high risk. Potential barriers to the ability to adhere to these measures need to be addressed.

N2  - Globally, health care providers have been challenged to provide adequate care during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Due to the ever changing and rapidly evolving nature of the novel coronavirus, there is increased public anxiety and knowledge gaps that have created major dilemmas in health care delivery. In this environment, there is tremendous pressure on clinicians to diagnose each and every case of COVID-19. This has led to a situation in which clinicians are primed to suspect all respiratory illness is due to COVID-19 infection until proven otherwise. Because of this, providers may misdiagnose patients who have illnesses that are distinct from COVID-19 but present in a similar manner. In the current article, we present the case of e-cigarette- and vaping-associated acute lung injury (EVALI) mimicking pneumonia secondary to the novel coronavirus. It is unknown if vaping puts patients at higher risk of respiratory failure if coinfected with COVID-19. Therefore, exposure history in patients presenting with pneumonia-like syndrome is important. Physicians should be aware of the overlap between these conditions and should pay particular attention during history taking to distinguish EVALI from COVID-19 pneumonia.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance. There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The pandemic of novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading rapidly across the United States. We provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Texas, which includes vast rural & vulnerable communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this new disease. All 254 Texas counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 from March 1 through April 8, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and case fatality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted incidence and case fatality rates by county-level demographic and healthcare resource factors. Counties which are part of metropolitan regions, such as Harris and Dallas, experienced the highest total number of confirmed cases. However, the highest incidence rates per 100,000 population were in found in counties of Donley (353.5), Castro (136.4), Matagorda (114.4) and Galveston (93.4). Among counties with greater than 10 cases, the highest CFR were observed in counties of Comal (10.3%), Hockley (10%), Hood (10%), and Castro (9.1%). Counties with the highest CFR (> 10%) had a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents, adults aged 65 and older, and adults smoking, but lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and number of primary care physicians per 1000 population. Although the urban areas of Texas account for the majority of COVID-19 cases, the higher case-fatality rates and low health care capacity in rural areas need attention.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a considerable number of deaths worldwide. This ecological study aimed to explore the relationship between COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality with smoking, obesity, and underlying conditions in Iran. Methods: Provincial-level COVID-19 data were obtained from the official reports. Two outcomes were assessed: the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Data on underlying health conditions, cigarette smoking, and obesity were obtained from national surveys. Negative binomial regression was used to report incident rate (IRR) ratios. Results: As of April 22, 2020, a total number of 43 950 lab-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations and 5391confirmed COVID-19 deaths were officially reported. Adjusting for underdetection to cover the number of clinically-confirmed COVID-19 cases, a total of 76 962 additional hospitalizations (ie, total lab- and clinically-confirmed hospitalizations = 120 912; 175% increase) and 7558 additional deaths (ie, total lab- and clinically-confirmed deaths = 12 949; 140% increase) were estimated during the same period. Provinces with a higher prevalence of obesity (IRR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.49, 5.10), cigarette smoking (1.81; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.27), hypertension (1.88; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.44), and diabetes mellitus (1.74; 95% CI: 0.96, 3.16) had a higher likelihood of COVID-19 death rates. Conclusion:  Inequality in COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality was observed in provinces whose populations had underlying diseases, in particular, obesity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily. Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed., RESULTS: This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress., CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.

N2  - Objectives: The coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the restructuring of health-services to prioritize the treatment of COVID-19. The severe restrictions on daily life affected the management of chronic diseases. Patients with a previous history of premature myocardial infarction (MI) are a vulnerable group requiring frequent and continued medical attention both in the pandemic and non-pandemic era. The present study was conducted to provide insight into the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on heart-healthy lifestyle and management of patients with a history of premature MI., Methods: This cross-sectional study included 170 consecutive patients with a history of premature MI who were already in regular follow-up in a tertiary out-patient prevention clinic before the pandemic. Inclusion criteria included age >=18 years and being on regular follow up with the diagnosis of premature MI (documented MI before the age of 55 years) at least for one year. All patients were contacted by phone-call and replied to a 23-item questionnaire measuring the impact of the pandemic on the management, healthy lifestyle habits, and anxiety level., Results: One patient died due to COVID-19 infection; therefore the analyses were conducted in 169 patients (age: 47.67 +/- 11.84 years, 21.3% women). The median age at first MI was 39 (IQR 10) years and the median time elapsed since the first MI was 7 years (IQR 10). The study population was highly compliant with the follow-up visits (78.1%) and pharmacological therapy (97%) before the pandemic according to the medical files. The majority (82.2%) of the patients were aware that having a history of premature MI would increase the risk and harm of COVID-19. Anxiety level increased in 62.7% of the study patients. Overall, 65.7% of the patient group reported a disruption at least in >=1 component(s) of healthy life-behaviors (non-compliance with the heart-healthy diet, an increase in alcohol intake, an increase in smoking, and/or reduced physical activity) since the emergence of the outbreak. The anxiety level (p = 0.001) and the prevalence of appetite change (p < 0.0001) and weight gain (p < 0.0001) was lower in the lifestyle compliant group than the non-compliant group. Avoidance of seeking medical care was reported in 33.7% of the patients. Statin use was 99.4% before the pandemic and decreased to 89.9% (p < 0.0001) despite the fact that medications were reimbursed and widely available., Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the heart-healthy lifestyle and anxiety levels of patients with a history of premature MI who were already in regular follow-up in a tertiary prevention clinic and led to significant avoidance of medical care. More rigorous follow-up, education, and reassurance of these patients with telemedicine are necessary for the prevention of further increase in their risk. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The coronavirus pandemic first started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and affected the whole world. In our country, new measures to be taken were announced after the first case was seen on March 11, 2020. In this study, patients who admitted to the smoking cessation clinic in 2018 and followed up by phone, regarding smoking cessation status in 2019 were questioned for their smoking cessation status after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In this descriptive study, the patients who applied to the smoking cessation outpatient clinic in 2018 were questioned regarding their smoking cessation status after 1 year and after the pandemic. It was investigated whether coronapandemia had an effect on smoking cessation. The data were evaluated by using SPSS 22 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 357 individuals with a median of Fagerstrom score of 7.0 were included in the study. Seventy-one (19.9%) of the subjects used nicotine tape, 268 (75.1%) used varenicline, and 18 (5.0%) used both. When the success of those who quit smoking before pandemic and those who quit smoking after pandemic were compared, a statistically significant relationship was found (p < 0.001). In our study, the rate of smoking cessation after 1 year was 23.7%, and the most common side effects were psychiatric complaints, whereas the rate of smoking cessation during the pandemic period was 31.1%. In order to increase the rate of smoking cessation, which is an important public health problem, more counseling should be provided, during the pandemic period.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - AIMS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients continue to require urgent surgery for hip fractures. However, the impact of COVID-19 on perioperative outcomes in these high-risk patients remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to establish the effects of COVID-19 on perioperative morbidity and mortality, and determine any risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing hip fracture surgery., METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 340 COVID-19-negative patients versus 82 COVID-19-positive patients undergoing surgical treatment for hip fractures across nine NHS hospitals in Greater London, UK. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, fracture configuration, and type of surgery performed. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify risk factors associated with increased risk of mortality., RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients had increased postoperative mortality rates (30.5% (25/82) vs 10.3% (35/340) respectively, p < 0.001) compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status (hazard ratio (HR) 15.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 52.2; p < 0.001) and greater than three comorbidities (HR 13.5 (95% CI 2.82 to 66.0, p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients had increased risk of postoperative complications (89.0% (73/82) vs 35.0% (119/340) respectively; p < 0.001), more critical care unit admissions (61.0% (50/82) vs 18.2% (62/340) respectively; p < 0.001), and increased length of hospital stay (mean 13.8 days (SD 4.6) vs 6.7 days (SD 2.5) respectively; p < 0.001), compared to COVID-19-negative patients., CONCLUSION: Hip fracture surgery in COVID-19-positive patients was associated with increased length of hospital stay, more admissions to the critical care unit, higher risk of perioperative complications, and increased mortality rates compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status and multiple (greater than three) comorbidities.

T1  - Twitter Discourse on Nicotine as Potential Prophylactic or Therapeutic for COVID-19.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Objective: The low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotine's therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them., Methods: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets., Results: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping., Conclusion: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.

T1  - SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 susceptibility and lung inflammatory storm by smoking and vaping.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The current pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe morbidity and mortality across the globe. People with a smoking history have severe disease outcomes by COVID-19 infection. Epidemiological studies show that old age and pre-existing disease conditions (hypertension and diabetes) result in severe disease outcome and mortality amongst COVID-19 patients. Evidences suggest that the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) membrane spike has a high affinity towards the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found on the host's lung epithelium. Likewise, TMPRSS2 protease has been shown to be crucial for viral activation thus facilitating the viral engulfment. The viral entry has been shown to cause 'cytokine storm' involving excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-7, IP-10, MCP-3 or GM-CSF, which is augmented by smoking. Future research could target these inflammatory-immunological responses to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. This mini-review provides a consolidated account on the role of inflammation and immune responses, proteases, and epithelial permeability by smoking and vaping during SARS-CoV2 infection with future directions of research, and provides a list of the potential targets for therapies particularly controlling cytokine storms in the lung.

T1  - Increased odds ratio for COVID-19 in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
A1  - Katz, Joseph

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The ACE2 receptor, the binding sites for the COVID-19, is expressed abundantly in the oral cavity, raising the question of whether the mouth is a target for the virus in addition to organs such as kidneys and lungs. Recently, a flurry of individual case reports on oral manifestation of COVID-19 including ulceration, blistering lesions, and stomatitis were published. However, it is not clear whether the oral presentations that are not unique to the virus are indeed related to the virus and appear at a higher prevalence than in the general population. We used the i2b2 platform of hospital patient's registry to determine the odds ratio for COVID-19 in patients that were diagnosed with recurrent aphthous stomatitis, an entity restricted to the oral cavity. The overall odds ratio for COVID-19 in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis before adjustments was 14 and after adjustment for gender, race, and age was 13.9, 6.5, and 2.93, respectively. The odds ratio remained increased after adjustments of the comorbidities such as respiratory disease, endocrine disease, obesity, diabetes, circulatory disease, and smoking and was 3.66, 7.46, 4.6, 10.54, 7.37, and 7.52, respectively. When adjusted for recurrent aphthous stomatitis, the respiratory disease had an odd ratio of 8.56 to be associated with COVID-19. African American race and age-group 18-34 were additional significant risk factors. The present study has demonstrated a significant association between COVID-19 and RAS; however, additional longitudinal and laboratory studies are necessary to establish a cause and effect relationship between these 2 conditions.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 771,000 deaths worldwide. Tobacco smoking is a major known risk factor for severe illness and even death from many respiratory infections. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 are currently controversial. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of smoking on the clinical manifestations, disease progression, inflammatory responses, immunopathogenesis, racial ethnic disparities, and incidence of COVID-19. This review also documents future directions of smoking related research in COVID-19. The current epidemiological finding suggests that active smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell and activate a 'cytokine storm' which can lead to worsen outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This receptor can also act as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on a legacy of inequalities regarding gender, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with active smoking, thus, smoking cessation may help in improving outcomes. In addition, to flatten the COVID-19 curve, staying indoors, avoiding unnecessary social contact, and bolstering the immune defense system by maintaining a healthy diet/living are highly desirable.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Although many countries in the world prioritize self-isolation measures during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period, the effects of this process on sexual functioning are not yet known., AIM: To evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual functioning of individuals who declared no medical history of the COVID-19 disease., METHODS: A total of 1,356 participants filled out an Internet-based survey between June 1 and June 20, 2020. The data from these participants were analyzed to determine sexual functioning in terms of sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroups analyses were also performed, wherein the subgroups were developed according to the population density of the cities in which the participants lived to examine whether population density has any effect on the sexual functions of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual functioning., RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.16 +/- 8.31 years. There was a statistically significant difference between the participants according to the decrease in the number of weekly sexual intercourses when they were compared in terms of smoking status, alcohol consumption, marital and parental status, being a health-care worker, having a regular sexual partner, and the working status during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each). In the subgroup analyses, it was observed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups for change in the number of sexual intercourses, the number of masturbations, and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each)., CONCLUSION: A decline in sexual functioning was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Living in a metropolitan area was associated with a decline in both sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Karsiyakali N, Sahin Y, Ates HA, et al.

T1  - Do men have a higher case fatality rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome than women do?.
T3  - [Comment in: Am J Epidemiol. 2004 Nov 1;160(9):925-6; PMID: 15496548 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496548]]

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative total of 8,099 probable cases and 774 deaths as of July 31, 2003, according to the World Health Organization. In Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, 1,755 SARS cases and 299 deaths had occurred as of September 22, 2003. The authors analyzed data from the Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR. The data series includes details regarding sex, age, and chronic disease history. Using data from early March to September 22, 2003, the authors found that males had a significantly (p < 0.0001) higher case fatality rate than females did, 21.9% versus 13.2%; the relative risk was 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35, 2.05), and it was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.16) after adjustment for age. Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis. The overall crude relative risk of mortality was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.74), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.00). Thus, among SARS patients, males may be more severely affected by the disease than females are. This finding could be related to a nonuniform case definition of SARS disease, a different treatment regimen, a past smoking history, work-environment factors, or gender-specific immune-defense factors, for instance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The lockdown imposed to counter the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evoked an unprecedented phenomenon that could affect health behaviors and beliefs., OBJECTIVE: To examine how medication-, dietary supplement- and health-related behaviors, beliefs and other psychological constructs changed in Polish online health service users during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown., METHODS: A one-time online survey accessed through a health service website was completed before and during the pandemic lockdown by separate samples of respondents. The survey examined beliefs about medicines and dietary supplements, consumption of dietary supplements, trust and contact with their advertisements, sources of dietary supplement knowledge as well as perceived health, diet, physical activity and smoking, among other things., RESULTS: The study included 1560 participants. Most examined outcomes remained unchanged over COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Beliefs that the dietary supplement quality is well controlled became significantly more pronounced during the lockdown (adjusted ratio of estimates 1.16, 95%CI 1.06-1.27, p = 0.001). Fewer people reported having contact with dietary supplement advertisements (adjusted odds ratio 0.59, 95%CI 0.43-0.83, p = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The results may help understand some health-related issues associated with COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and may be used to shape aspects of health-related policy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the modifiable risk factors for ST elevation myocardial infarction is prehospital delay. The purpose of our study was to look at the effect of contamination contamination obsession on prehospital delay compared with other measurements during the Covid-19 pandemic., METHOD: A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was >120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD)., RESULT: The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120-360), 120 (60-180), and 105 (60-180), respectively; P = 0.012). Multivariable logistic regression (model-2) was used to examine the association between 7 candidate predictors (age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, pain-onset time, and coronary artery disease (CAD) history), PI-WSUR C-OCD, and admission month with prehospital delay. Among variables, PI-WSUR C-OCD and admission month were independently associated with prehospital delay (OR 5.36 (2.11-13.61) (P = 0.01); 0.26 (0.09-0.87) p < 0.001] respectively]., CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that contamination obsession was associated with prehospital delay of STEMI patients, however anxiety and depression level was not associated during the pandemic.

N2  - There is widespread concern about treatment of psoriasis in COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment features of the psoriasis patients during the pandemic period. We conducted a study in dermatology clinics of seven different tertiary centers. All adult psoriasis patients who were followed up between 11 March 2020 and 28 June 2020, were phone called or questioned in their visit to their follow-up clinics. A semistructured questionnaire was applied and patients' demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. Of 1322 patients, 52.4% were male, and 47.6% were female. According to the questionnaire responses, 964 (72.9%) of these patients could not communicate with their physician during this period, remained 358 (27.1%) patients contacted the physician by phone, email, or hospital visit. From the patients diagnosed as probable/confirmed COVID-19, 14 were female, and 9 were male. Nine of 23 (39.1%) patients were using biologic treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hospitalization from COVID-19 between the patients using biologics (n = 9) and those who did not (n = 14) (P = 1.00). No mortality was observed among them. Obesity, smoking, age, and accompanying psoriatic arthritis were not among the risk factors affecting the frequency of COVID-19. We only encountered an increased risk in diabetic patients. Also, an exacerbation of psoriasis was observed with the infection. No difference was found in patients with psoriasis in terms of COVID-19 infection in patients who use biologics and those who don't. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (CoV) have been long recognized as a common cause of respiratory tract disease including severe respiratory tract illness. Coronavirus-HKU1 has been described predominantly among children less than 5 years of age in the United States with few studies characterizing the disease spectrum among adults., METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens of patients with respiratory symptoms were analyzed for CoV-HKU1 by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel multiplex assay from February 7, 2016 to April 30, 2016. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected on adults (patients >18 years) whose samples screened positive., RESULTS: Of 832 adult respiratory specimens screened, 13 (1.6%) cases of CoV-HKU1 were identified. Adults age ranged between 23 and 75 years and 6 (46%) were males. All of whom had 1 or more respiratory symptoms, and 5 (38%) also reported 1 or more gastrointestinal symptoms. Eleven (85%) reported history of smoking and 5 (38%) used inhaled steroids. Seven (54%) required hospitalization, 5 (71%) of these needed supplemental oxygen, and 2 (29%) were admitted to intensive care. Median length of hospitalization was 5 days. Eight (62%) received antibiotics despite identification of CoV-HKU1. Infectious work-up in 1 patient who died did not reveal any other pathogen. In 2 (15%) CoV-HKU1-positive adults, the only viral coinfection detected was influenza A., CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus-HKU1 accounted for 1.6% of adult respiratory infections and should be considered in differential diagnosis of severe respiratory illnesses among adults.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Exposure, risks and immunity of healthcare workers (HCWs), a vital resource during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, warrant special attention., METHODS: HCWs at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, filled in questionnaires and provided serum samples for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody screening by Euroimmun IgG assay in March-April 2020. Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+)., RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age <55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4% of those RT-PCR-negative. The rate of previously unidentified cases was 0.7% (8/1067) and asymptomatic ones 0% (0/36)., CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases among HCWs proved rare. An increased risk was associated with Covid-19-dedicated wards. Particularly high rates were seen for wards with liberal HCW-HCW contacts, highlighting the importance of social distancing also among HCWs. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is a significant challenge for health-care systems around the world., Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the impact of comorbidities on the case fatality rate (CFR) and the development of adverse events in patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Mexican population., Materials and methods: We analyzed the data from 13,842 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients in Mexico between January 1, 2020, and April 25, 2020. We investigated the risk of death and the development of adverse events (hospitalization, pneumonia, orotracheal intubation, and intensive care unit [ICU] admission), comparing the number of comorbidities of each patient., Results: The patient mean age was 46.6 +/- 15.6 years, 42.3% (n = 5853) of the cases were women, 38.8% of patients were hospitalized, 4.4% were intubated, 29.6% developed pneumonia, and 4.4% had critical illness. The CFR was 9.4%. The risk of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-3.7), pneumonia (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 2.6-3.5), ICU admission (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.5-2.7), and CFR (hazard ratio = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.9-4.2) was higher in patients with three or more comorbidities than in patients with 1, 2, or with no comorbidities., Conclusions: The number of comorbidities may be a determining factor in the clinical course and its outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The reports suggesting a beneficial effect of nicotine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity may encourage smoking. We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. The authors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the promotion of their results before the completion of the peer-review process. Twitter presents a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse during a health crisis. The research community should monitor the tobacco industry's social media.

N2  - There is mixed evidence surrounding the relationship between tobacco use and COVID-19 infection/progression. The current study investigates beliefs and tobacco use behaviors and COVID-19 infection among a sample of smokers and never-smokers. Data were collected using an online survey distributed through Telegram, a cloud-based social media networking application in Iran from April 1 to May 31, 2020. The study participants included never-smokers (n = 511), current (past-month) waterpipe smokers (n = 89), current cigarette smokers (n = 158), and ex-smokers (n = 172). Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare tobacco use groups with never- smokers on beliefs, controlling for potential confounders. The study participants (n = 944) was mostly male (64%), had > high school education (76%), and lived in an urban area (91%), with mean +/- SD age of 35.3 +/- 10.8. Key findings of this study are that compared with never-smokers: (1) cigarette smokers were less likely to believe that smoking cigarette can lead to spreading COVID-19; (2) waterpipe smokers were more likely to believe that smoking waterpipe at home was a safe practice, that waterpipe protects against COVID-19, and smoking waterpipe may lead to a more rapid recovery from COVID-19; (3) both waterpipe and cigarette smokers believed that using e-cigarettes in public places was a safe practice during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) more than half of the ex-smokers stopped smoking due to COVID-19 and most of them planned to continue abstaining from smoking after the pandemic. Our findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the unsupported claims of a lower hazard of using tobacco products or possible protective effects against COVID-19 and to promote cessation programs.

N2  - COVID19 is a devastating global pandemic with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and now the United States. While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases, individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss. To that end, less is known about how the virus may impact different organ systems. The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here, we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2. We advocate for higher surveillance and analysis of neurocomplications in infected cases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The COVID19 epidemic has spurred a global public health crisis. While many of the cases requiring hospitalization and intensive medical care center on cardiorespiratory treatment, a growing number of cases present neurological symptoms. Viral entry into the brain now appears a strong possibility with deleterious consequences and an urgent need for addressing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Latin America there are about 45 million indigenous people in 826 communities that represent 8.3% of the population. An estimated 798,365 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander were in Australia, 5,2 million indigenous people living in America and 2,13 million in Canada. Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increased especially in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic METHOD: : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers., RESULTS: According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink). The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population., CONCLUSION: providing psychological first aid is an essential care component for indigenous populations that have been victims COVID-19 pandemic.

Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increased especially in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic., Method: : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers., Results: : According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink). The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population., Conclusion: : providing psychological first aid is an essential care component for indigenous populations that have been victims COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - One of the biggest challenges of public health worldwide is reducing the number of events and deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, has been identified as a potent receptor for SARSCoV-2. In the last decades, ACE inhibition has assumed a central role in reducing cardiovascular and renal events. However, with the advent of COVID-19, attention has been turned to ACE-2 as a possible target to reduce virus binding to different human cells. This review aims to discuss recent developments related to medicinal properties of natural compounds as ACE/ACE-2 inhibitors, which should be highlighted in the future development of studies looking for modulators in SARSCoV-2 infection. Data show that bioactive compounds isolated from several natural products act by inhibiting ACE/ACE2, which changes the entire axis of this system. Of the compounds addressed in this review, 7 phenolic compounds, including quercetin, curcumin, naringenin, luteolin, hesperidin, mangiferin, and gallic acid showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico, and 1, esculetin, decreased ACE-2 expression in vivo. Regarding terpenoids and alkaloids, nimbin, withaferin A, andrographolide, zingiberene and, berberine, piperine and thebaine, respectively, showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico. These findings reinforce the need for future preclinical and clinical studies on these compounds and specific inhibitory effects on ACE-2 of all the other compounds described herein only as nonspecific ACE inhibitors. It is important to mention that some natural compounds such as magnolol, resveratrol, rosmarinic acid, tanshinone IIA, and nicotine have also demonstrated the potential to increase the activity or expression of ACE-2, and could therefore aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

N2  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on US adults' smoking and quitting behaviors is unclear. We explored the impact of COVID-19 on smoking behaviors, risk perceptions, and reactions to text messages during a statewide stay-at-home advisory among primary care patients who were trying to quit. From May-June 2020, we interviewed smokers enrolled in a 12-week, pilot cessation trial providing text messaging and mailed nicotine replacement medication (NCT04020718). Twenty-two individuals (82% white, mean age 55 years), representing 88% of trial participants during the stay-at-home advisory, completed exit interviews; four (18%) of them reported abstinence. Interviews were thematically analyzed by two coders. COVID-19-induced environmental changes had mixed effects, facilitating quitting for some and impeding quitting for others. While stress increased for many, those who quit found ways to cope with stress. Generally, participants felt at risk for COVID-19 complications but not at increased risk of becoming infected. Reactions to COVID-19 and quitting behaviors differed across age groups, older participants reported difficulties coping with isolation (e.g., feeling disappointed when a text message came from the study and not a live person). Findings suggest that cessation interventions addressing stress and boredom are needed during COVID-19, while smokers experiencing isolation may benefit from live-person supports.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if tobacco use in patients with Covid-19 is associated with a negative disease course and adverse outcome, and if smoking, current and past, is associated with a greater possibility of developing COVID-19., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of previously published works were performed. The search strategy included all known descriptors for Covid-19 and tobacco and was conducted in different databases. Appropriate statistical models were used to address the effect size in meta-analysis, namely random effects and fixed effects model., RESULTS: Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress., CONCLUSION: Current and past smoking produces a more serious clinical form of Covid-19 and more frequently leads to intensive care admission, intubation, and death.

N2  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive lung disease with few successful treatments, and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking (CS). Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide seriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because of lung dysfunction. Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China and Japan. Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative stress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood. The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue. The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IkappaB and NFkappaB and increased p-Akt. Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice. Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular toxicity as a consequence of nicotine from conventional tobacco cigarette smoking is well documented. However, little is known about the cardiovascular consequences of nicotine e-vaping. We review the literature and report a case series of three cases of major adverse cardiovascular clinical effects post nicotine e-vaping., Case summary: Three patients with known peripheral arterial disease who switched from heavy cigarette smoking consumption to a high-intensity dose of nicotine e-vaping all developed further arterial complications within 6-30 months., Discussion: With the recent epidemic of e-vaping in young individuals and the national outbreak of e-vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI), the dangers of e-vaping are now coming to light. The pulmonary effects are now well described, and this paper highlights three new cases of cardiovascular toxicity associated with e-vaping. The potential role of nicotine e-vaping and the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) will also be discussed. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 is a pandemic that is straining healthcare resources, mainly hospital beds. Multiple risk factors of disease progression requiring hospitalization have been identified, but medical decision-making remains complex., OBJECTIVE: To characterize a large cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, their outcomes, develop and validate a statistical model that allows individualized prediction of future hospitalization risk for a patient newly diagnosed with COVID-19., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 applying a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm to retain the most predictive features for hospitalization risk, followed by validation in a temporally distinct patient cohort. The final model was displayed as a nomogram and programmed into an online risk calculator., SETTING: One healthcare system in Ohio and Florida., PARTICIPANTS: All patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Those tested before May 1 were included in the development cohort, while those tested May 1 and later comprised the validation cohort., MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, social influencers of health, exposure risk, medical co-morbidities, vaccination history, presenting symptoms, medications, and laboratory values were collected on all patients, and considered in our model development., RESULTS: 4,536 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Of those, 958 (21.1%) required hospitalization. By day 3 of hospitalization, 24% of patients were transferred to the intensive care unit, and around half of the remaining patients were discharged home. Ten patients died. Hospitalization risk was increased with older age, black race, male sex, former smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung disease, poor socioeconomic status, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and certain medications (NSAIDs, immunosuppressive treatment). Hospitalization risk was reduced with prior flu vaccination. Model discrimination was excellent with an area under the curve of 0.900 (95% confidence interval of 0.886-0.914) in the development cohort, and 0.813 (0.786, 0.839) in the validation cohort. The scaled Brier score was 42.6% (95% CI 37.8%, 47.4%) in the development cohort and 25.6% (19.9%, 31.3%) in the validation cohort. Calibration was very good. The online risk calculator is freely available and found at https://riskcalc.org/COVID19Hospitalization/., LIMITATION: Retrospective cohort design., CONCLUSION: Our study crystallizes published risk factors of COVID-19 progression, but also provides new data on the role of social influencers of health, race, and influenza vaccination. In a context of a pandemic and limited healthcare resources, individualized outcome prediction through this nomogram or online risk calculator can facilitate complex medical decision-making.

T1  - You've got a friend in me: sociable robots for older adults in an age of global pandemics.
A1  - Jecker, Nancy S
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Social isolation and loneliness are ongoing threats to health made worse by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. During the pandemic, half the globe's population have been placed under strict physical distancing orders and many long-term care facilities serving older adults went into lockdown mode, restricting access to all visitors, including family members. Before the pandemic emerged, a 2020 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report warned of the underappreciated adverse effects of social isolation and loneliness on health, especially among older populations. Social isolation and loneliness predict all-cause mortality at rates that rival clinical risk factors, such as obesity and smoking; they are associated with greater incidence of psychological, cognitive, and physical morbidities. This paper sets forth a proposal to design robots to function as companions and friends for socially isolated and lonely older people during pandemic emergencies and in aging societies more generally. "The proposal" section presents and defends the proposal. The "Replies to objections" section answers objections based on coercive design, replacement of humans with robots, privacy incursions, and counterfeit companionship. The "Conclusion" section submits that sociable robots offer a promising avenue for addressing social isolation and loneliness during pandemics and hold promise for aging societies more broadly.

N2  - An increasing body of evidence suggests a protective effect of some psychoactive substances against SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2). Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases). We propose here a mixed pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacochemical hypothesis to explain these findings. A number of psychotropic drugs exhibit activities against coronaviruses (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)) and have been put forward as potentially anti-SARS-CoV-2. These treatments include numerous mee-too drugs (chemically and pharmacologically linked to those which have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy) which are frequently prescribed in psychiatric settings. Taken alone or in polypharmacy, these drugs could have a prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, explaining the unexpectedly low proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Associated factors such as nicotine can also be considered in the context of a broad chemoprophylactic hypothesis in patients with psychiatric disorders taking different psychoactive substances.

N2  - The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak was designated a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The relationship between vaping and contracting COVID-19 is unclear, and information on the internet is conflicting. There is some scientific evidence that vaping cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient in cannabis that is obtained from the hemp plant, or other substances is associated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. However, there is also inaccurate information that vaping can aid COVID-19 treatment, as well as expert opinion that CBD, possibly administered through vaping, can mitigate COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it is necessary to study the spread of inaccurate information to better understand how to promote scientific knowledge and curb inaccurate information, which is critical to the health of vapers. Inaccurate information about vaping and COVID-19 may affect COVID-19 treatment outcomes., OBJECTIVE: Using structural topic modeling, we aimed to map temporal trends in the web-based vaping narrative (a large data set comprising web-based vaping chatter from several sources) to indicate how the narrative changed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We obtained data using a textual query that scanned a data pool of approximately 200,000 different domains (4,027,172 documents and 361,100,284 words) such as public internet forums, blogs, and social media, from August 1, 2019, to April 21, 2020. We then used structural topic modeling to understand changes in word prevalence and semantic structures within topics around vaping before and after December 31, 2019, when COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization., RESULTS: Broadly, the web-based vaping narrative can be organized into the following groups or archetypes: harms from vaping; Vaping Regulation; Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment; and Vaping Lifestyle. Three archetypes were observed prior to the emergence of COVID-19; however, four archetypes were identified post-COVID-19 (Vaping as Harm Reduction or Treatment was the additional archetype). A topic related to CBD product preference emerged after COVID-19 was first reported, which may be related to the use of CBD by vapers as a COVID-19 treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is the emergence of a vape-administered CBD treatment narrative around COVID-19 when comparing the web-based vaping narratives before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are key to understanding how vapers respond to inaccurate information about COVID-19, optimizing treatment of vapers who contract COVID-19, and possibly minimizing instances of inaccurate information. The findings have implications for the management of COVID-19 among vapers and the monitoring of web-based content pertinent to tobacco to develop targeted interventions to manage COVID-19 among vapers.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The Asia-Pacific region is home to a large heterogeneous population whose respiratory health is influenced by diverse social, economic and environmental factors. Despite this variability, the most prevalent causes of respiratory morbidity and mortality are tobacco smoking, infection, and air pollution. This review aims to summarize current respiratory health issues in the region including smoking-related diseases especially COPD, lung cancer and infectious problems such as pandemic influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis, as well as the contribution of air pollution to respiratory disease. Published data on trends in the epidemiology and management of respiratory diseases and are summarized; finally, the limitations of available data and projections for the future of respiratory health in the region are discussed.

N2  - PURPOSE: Knowledge regarding patients' clinical condition at severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is sparse. Data in the international, multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients (LEOSS) cohort study may enhance the understanding of COVID-19., METHODS: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models., RESULTS: We included 2155 patients, 59.7% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was 66-85 years (39.6%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0% (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found. Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age [46-65 years: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.73, 95% CI 1.25-2.42, p = 0.001; 66-85 years: aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.36-2.74, p < 0.001; > 85 years: aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.49-3.81, p < 0.001 vs. individuals aged 26-45 years], male sex (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.50, p = 0.040), cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.72, p = 0.007), and diabetes (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.69, p = 0.023) were associated with complicated stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis., CONCLUSION: The LEOSS cohort identified age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male sex as risk factors for complicated disease stages at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, thus confirming previous data. Further data regarding outcomes of the natural course of COVID-19 and the influence of treatment are required.

T1  - Eye Diseases Direct Interest to Complement Pathway and Macrophages as Regulators of Inflammation in COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - ABSTRACT: Many of the risk factors for developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are also risk factors for eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). During the past decades, macrophages and the complement pathway (as a part of the innate immune system) have been identified as important contributors to the development of AMD, and we suggest that these mechanisms are of similar importance for the clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Based on the experience with AMD, we discuss how behavioral factors such as diet, smoking and higher body mass index, as well as genetic determinants such as the complement and immune pathway genes may lead to the overactive inflammatory phenotypes seen in some patients with COVID-19, and may in part explain the heterogeneity of disease manifestations and outcomes. Based on this experience, we discuss potential genetic research projects and elaborate on preventive and treatment approaches related to COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: On 23rd March 2020, the UK government released self-isolation/social distancing guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known., AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public., METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey., OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: "On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model., RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption., STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic., CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

N2  - AIM: To examine changes in smoking, drinking and quitting/reduction behaviour following the COVID-19 lockdown in England., DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (>= 16 years)., MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant)., FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75)., CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine associations between smoking and COVID-19 relevant outcomes, taking into account the influence of inequalities and adjusting for potential confounding variables., METHODS: Cross-sectional data were used from an online study of adults in the UK (n=53 002). Main outcome measures were confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and adherence to protective behaviours. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no), key worker status and comorbid health conditions., RESULTS: Compared with never smokers (0.26% (95% CI 0.21% to 0.33%)), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.56% (0.41% to 0.75%)) but not ex-smokers (0.19% (0.13% to 0.28%)). Associations were similar before (current: OR=2.14 (1.49-3.08); ex-smokers: OR=0.73 (0.47-1.14)) and after (current: OR=1.79 (1.22-2.62); ex-smokers: OR=0.85 (0.54-1.33)) adjustment. For current smokers, this was moderated by socio-economic position, with higher rates only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR=3.53 (2.04-6.10)). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% (10.6% to 11.9%), OR=1.11 (1.03-1.20)) and ex-smokers (10.9% (10.4% to 11.5%), OR=1.07 (1.01-1.15)) than never smokers (10.2% (9.9% to 10.6%)), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR=1.21 (1.13-1.29)). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR=1.34 (1.27-1.43); ex-smokers: OR=1.22 (1.16-1.28)). Adherence to recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19 was high (96.3% (96.1% to 96.4%)), but lower among current than never smokers (OR=0.70 (0.62-0.78))., CONCLUSIONS: In a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with self-reported confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socio-economic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

N2  - Researchers believe that smoking might increase the severity of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 by altering the viability and integrity of the BBB, while promoting the expression of ACE2 in endothelial cells, glia, and neurons. Moreover, as smoking increases the blood circulatory level of VWF and decreases the levels of thrombomodulin, it can lead to dysregulated blood homeostasis and hence, increased risk of thrombosis which significantly increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disorders. However, despite current controversies and remarkable study limitations, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis claims that the findings of 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies show that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalized. The authors state that their observations might be due to the effects of nicotine. We believe that the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected, if confirmed by further studies, can be due to the higher concentration of deposited energy of alpha particles emitted from radionuclides such as Po-210 in cigarette tobacco. The anti-inflammatory effects of localized radiation energy deposition of alpha particles as well as the effect of low doses of radiation on reducing the risk of thrombosis, are possibly involved in the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since the initial anecdotal reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from China, a growing number of studies have reported on smell and/or taste dysfunction (STD). Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers., METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study on patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish hospitals. Data on STD were collected prospectively using an in-person survey. The severity of STD was categorized using a visual analog scale. We analyzed time to onset, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia, comorbidities, smoking, and symptoms., RESULTS: STD was at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive patients than in controls. COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients were older, with a lower frequency of STD, and recovered earlier than outpatients. Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. In the multivariate analysis, older age (>60 years), being hospitalized, and increased C-reactive protein were associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement in smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey; in 90.6% this was within 2 weeks of infection., CONCLUSION: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19 and presents mainly in young and nonhospitalized patients. More studies are needed to evaluate follow-up of chemosensory impairment.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of our systematic review is to identify prognostic factors that may be used in decision-making related to the care of patients infected with COVID-19., DATA SOURCES: We conducted highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Embase. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 28, 2020. No study design, publication status or language restriction were applied., STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included studies that assessed patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease and examined one or more prognostic factors for mortality or disease severity. Reviewers working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome., RESULTS: We included 207 studies and found high or moderate certainty that the following 49 variables provide valuable prognostic information on mortality and/or severe disease in patients with COVID-19 infectious disease: Demographic factors (age, male sex, smoking), patient history factors (comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer and dyslipidemia), physical examination factors (respiratory failure, low blood pressure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, dyspnea, anorexia, tachypnea, haemoptysis, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and myalgia or arthralgia), laboratory factors (high blood procalcitonin, myocardial injury markers, high blood White Blood Cell count (WBC), high blood lactate, low blood platelet count, plasma creatinine increase, high blood D-dimer, high blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high blood C-reactive protein (CRP), decrease in lymphocyte count, high blood aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decrease in blood albumin, high blood interleukin-6 (IL-6), high blood neutrophil count, high blood B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), high blood creatine kinase (CK), high blood bilirubin and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), radiological factors (consolidative infiltrate and pleural effusion) and high SOFA score (sequential organ failure assessment score)., CONCLUSION: Identified prognostic factors can help clinicians and policy makers in tailoring management strategies for patients with COVID-19 infectious disease while researchers can utilise our findings to develop multivariable prognostic models that could eventually facilitate decision-making and improve patient important outcomes., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Prospero registration number: CRD42020178802.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study retrospectively examined the health and social determinants of the COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries from a spatial epidemiological approach., METHODS: We used spatial analysis to examine the cross-national determinants of confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization official COVID-19 data and the World Bank Indicators of Interest to the COVID-19 outbreak. All models controlled for COVID-19 government measures., RESULTS: The percentage of the population age between 15-64 years (Age15-64), percentage smokers (SmokTot.), and out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPExp) significantly explained global variation in the current COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries. The percentage population age group 15-64 and out of pocket expenditure were positively associated with COVID-19. Conversely, the percentage of the total population who smoke was inversely associated with COVID-19 at the global level., CONCLUSIONS: This study is timely and could serve as a potential geospatial guide to developing public health and epidemiological surveillance programs for the outbreak in multiple countries. Removal of catastrophic medical expenditure, smoking cessation, and observing public health guidelines will not only reduce illness related to COVID-19 but also prevent unecessary deaths.

N2  - Importance: Identifying independent risk factors for adverse outcomes in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can support prognostication, resource utilization, and treatment., Objective: To identify excess risk and risk factors associated with hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection., Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study included 88747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between Feburary 28 and May 14, 2020, and followed up through June 22, 2020, in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national health care system, including 10131 patients (11.4%) who tested positive., Exposures: Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, symptoms, and laboratory test results., Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards models., Results: The 10131 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly male (9221 [91.0%]), with diverse race/ethnicity (5022 [49.6%] White, 4215 [41.6%] Black, and 944 [9.3%] Hispanic) and a mean (SD) age of 63.6 (16.2) years. Compared with patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, those who tested positive had higher rates of 30-day hospitalization (30.4% vs 29.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.13), mechanical ventilation (6.7% vs 1.7%; aHR, 4.15; 95% CI, 3.74-4.61), and death (10.8% vs 2.4%; aHR, 4.44; 95% CI, 4.07-4.83). Among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, characteristics significantly associated with mortality included older age (eg, >=80 years vs <50 years: aHR, 60.80; 95% CI, 29.67-124.61), high regional COVID-19 disease burden (eg, >=700 vs <130 deaths per 1 million residents: aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (eg, >=5 vs 0: aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.54-2.42), fever (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.32-1.72), dyspnea (aHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07), and abnormalities in the certain blood tests, which exhibited dose-response associations with mortality, including aspartate aminotransferase (>89 U/L vs <=25 U/L: aHR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.35-2.57), creatinine (>3.80 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL: aHR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.62-5.48), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>12.70 vs <=2.71: aHR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.12-3.91). With the exception of geographic region, the same covariates were independently associated with mechanical ventilation along with Black race (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.85), male sex (aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.30-3.32), diabetes (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67), and hypertension (aHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64). Notable characteristics that were not significantly associated with mortality in adjusted analyses included obesity (body mass index >=35 vs 18.5-24.9: aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.21), Black race (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.21), Hispanic ethnicity (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79-1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88-1.19), hypertension (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.12), and smoking (eg, current vs never: aHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.13). Most deaths in this cohort occurred in patients with age of 50 years or older (63.4%), male sex (12.3%), and Charlson Comorbidity Index score of at least 1 (11.1%)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this national cohort of VA patients, most SARS-CoV-2 deaths were associated with older age, male sex, and comorbidity burden. Many factors previously reported to be associated with mortality in smaller studies were not confirmed, such as obesity, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and smoking.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated to microvascular alterations. We screened the fundus of patients with COVID-19 to detect alterations of the retina and its vasculature and to assess possible correlations with clinical parameters., Methods: Cross-sectional study. The presence of retinal alterations in patients with COVID-19 and subjects unexposed to the virus was assessed using fundus photographs and their prevalence was compared. Mean arteries diameter (MAD) and mean veins diameter (MVD) were compared between patients and unexposed subjects with multiple linear regression including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking/alcohol consumption, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes as covariates. The influence of clinical/lab parameters on retinal findings was tested in COVID-19 patients., Findings: 54 patients and 133 unexposed subjects were enrolled. Retinal findings in COVID-19 included: haemorrhages (9.25%), cotton wools spots (7.4%), dilated veins (27.7%), tortuous vessels (12.9%). Both MAD and MVD were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to unexposed subjects (98.3 +/- 15.3 microm vs 91.9 +/- 11.7 microm, p = 0.006 and 138.5 +/- 21.5 microm vs 123.2 +/- 13.0 microm, p<0.0001, respectively). In multiple regression accounting for covariates MVD was positively associated with COVID-19 both in severe (coefficient 30.3, CI95% 18.1-42.4) and non-severe (coefficient 10.3, CI95% 1.6-19.0) cases compared to unexposed subjects. In COVID-19 patients MVD was negatively correlated with the time from symptoms onset (coefficient -1.0, CI 95% -1.89 to -0.20) and positively correlated with disease severity (coefficient 22.0, CI 95% 5.2-38.9)., Interpretation: COVID-19 can affect the retina. Retinal veins diameter seems directly correlated with the disease severity. Its assessment could have possible applications in the management of COVID-19., Funding: None.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the arterial complications and hypercoagulability associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We sought to characterize our experience with arterial thromboembolic complications in patients with hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: All patients admitted from March 1 to April 20, 2020, and who underwent carotid, upper, lower and aortoiliac arterial duplex, computed tomography angiogram or magnetic resonance angiography for suspected arterial thrombosis were included. A retrospective case control study design was used to identify, characterize and evaluate potential risk factors for arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Demographics, characteristics, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed., RESULTS: During the study period, 424 patients underwent 499 arterial duplex, computed tomography angiogram, or magnetic resonance angiography imaging studies with an overall 9.4% positive rate for arterial thromboembolism. Of the 40 patients with arterial thromboembolism, 25 (62.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons and 15 (37.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The odds ratio for arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-6.78; P = .001). Although not statistically significant, in patients with arterial thromboembolism, patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with those testing negative or not tested tended to be male (66.7% vs 40.0%; P = .191), have a less frequent history of former or active smoking (42.9% vs 68.0%; P = .233) and have a higher white blood cell count (14.5 vs 9.9; P = .208). Although the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients trended toward a higher the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (8.9 vs 4.1; P = .134), creatinine phosphokinase level (359.0 vs 144.5; P = .667), C-reactive protein level (24.2 vs 13.8; P = .627), lactate dehydrogenase level (576.5 vs 338.0; P = .313), and ferritin level (974.0 vs 412.0; P = .47), these differences did not reach statistical significance. Patients with arterial thromboembolic complications and SARS-CoV-2 positive when compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons were younger (64 vs 70 years; P = .027), had a significantly higher body mass index (32.6 vs 25.5; P = .012), a higher d-dimer at the time of imaging (17.3 vs 1.8; P = .038), a higher average in hospital d-dimer (8.5 vs 2.0; P = .038), a greater distribution of patients with clot in the aortoiliac location (5 vs 1; P = .040), less prior use of any antiplatelet medication (21.4% vs 62.5%; P = .035), and a higher mortality rate (40.0% vs 8.0%; P = .041). Treatment of arterial thromboembolic disease in COVID-19 positive patients included open thromboembolectomy in six patients (40%), anticoagulation alone in four (26.7%), and five (33.3%) did not require or their overall illness severity precluded additional treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for acute arterial thromboembolic complications despite a lack of conventional risk factors. A hyperinflammatory state may be responsible for this phenomenon with a preponderance for aortoiliac involvement. These findings provide an early characterization of arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Copyright © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia is a serious adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is very rare in non-diabetic patients. This case report describes a non-diabetic patient without any other chronic diseases, who experienced mild hypoglycemia related to HCQ used for COVID-19 treatment., METHODS: All etiologies causing hypoglycemia were investigated and a 72-hour fast test was performed., RESULTS: A 34-years old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a high fever, cough, and chest pain. The result of his COVID-19 PCR test was positive. He received HCQ for 10 days for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. He experienced fatigue, dizziness, severe headache, weakness and feeling of hunger after discontinuation of HCQ during his isolation at home. Before COVID-19 infection, he never experienced hypoglycemia symptoms. He did not have a history of chronic diseases, drug use, alcohol consumption or smoking. A Seventy two-hour fasting test was performed. He complained about headache and weakness during the 72 hours test period. The PG level was determined as 49 mg/dl during these symptoms. Concurrent insulin and C-peptide levels were <2 mU/mL and 0.553 ng/mL, respectively. ACTH, cortisol, growth hormone, liver and kidney function tests were normal. HbA1c level was 4.7% (28 mmol/mol) (Normal Range %4,5-5,7)., CONCLUSION: Hypoglycemia may be observed as an adverse effect of HCQ used for COVID-19 infection even in patients without chronic diseases and comorbidities. We must be careful while using HCQ for these patients and must warn them about this effect. The warning about hypoglycemia effect of HCQ must be added to COVID-19 treatment guidelines.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of coronavirus associated disease (COVID-19) placed the health care workers at high risk. We investigated clinical and treatment characteristics of infected medical professionals in a cardiovascular hospital., METHODS: The study was retrospective, conducted in tertiary cardiovascular hospital and included employees with confirmed coronavirus infection. They filled out a questionnaire about health status, symptoms, admission to hospital and treatment. The vaccination status against tuberculosis, hepatitis B and seasonal influenza was assessed. Pneumonia was defined as CT finding of ground glass opacifications (GGO) with consolidations typical for COVID-19., RESULTS: The study included 107 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 out of 726 employees (15%). Most of the infected were from cardiac surgery department (74/107, 69%). Substantial number of employees did not have any symptoms [31 (28.9%)] and 38 patients (35.5%) were admitted to hospital. The average hospital length of stay was 8.1 +/- 5.6 days. Seventy-five of 107 (70.1%) received seasonal influenza vaccine. Pneumonia with CT features of GGO and consolidation occurred in 25/107 (23.4%) patients of which 14/107 (13.1%) had bilateral involvement. In multivariate logistic regression analysis including recognized characteristics associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 (obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, current smoking, heart failure, influenza immunization), only influenza immunization remained an independent predictor of occurrence of bilateral pneumonia (OR 0.207; 95%CI[0.050 - 0.847]; p = 0.029)., CONCLUSIONS: The association of influenza immunization and less aggressive form of pneumonia might provide a finding that supports the institution of preventive measures that can be beneficial in reduction of global coronavirus burden.

N2  - In this study, we report a large family cluster consisting of 29 genetically related patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Twenty-nine patient files were investigated in group 1 and group 2 was created with 52 consecutive patients with COVID-19 having age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, and disease course. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of inhospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in the group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay, and transferred to intensive care unit were found to be statistically significantly higher in the group 1. In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared with consecutive patients with COVID-19 presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prediction of COVID-19 disease behavior in the early phase of infection is challenging but urgently needed. MuLBSTA score is a scoring system that predicts the mortality of viral pneumonia induced by a variety of viruses, including coronavirus, but the scoring system has not been verified in novel coronavirus pneumonia. The aim of this study was to validate this scoring system for estimating the risk of disease worsening in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This study included the patients who were treated between April 1 st and March 13 th , 2020. The patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups according to the extent of respiratory failure. MuLBSTA score was applied to estimate the risk of disease worsening in each severity group and we validated the utility of the scoring system., RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were analyzed. Among the 46 patients with mild disease, 17 showed disease progression to moderate or severe disease after admission. The model showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of only 34.5% with a cut-off value of 5 points. Among the 55 patients with mild or moderate disease, 6 deteriorated to severe disease, and the model showed a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4% with a cut-off value of 11 points., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MuLBSTA score is a potentially useful tool for predicting COVID-19 disease behavior. This scoring system may be used as one of the criteria to identify high-risk patients worsening to life-threatening status.

N2  - Purpose: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was firstly reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and soon after, the number of cases increased rapidly worldwide. As of May 2, 2020, more than 3,000,000 confirmed cases have been reported world. In Macao, there were 45 confirmed COVID-19 cases until May 2, 2020., Material and Methods: In this study, we summarized the radiological features of these cases and analyzed relationship between the clinical characteristics and radiological findings. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging manifestations of the 45 cases with COVID-19 in Macao, focusing on identifying and characterizing the most common radiological findings of COVID-19. We retrospectively analyze the relationship between the clinical features and radiological finding of COVID-19 pneumonia., Results: This study showed that chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multiple ground-glass densities in both lungs. It is dominated by bilateral peripheral subpleural distribution, which may be accompanied by consolidation, interlobular septa thickening, and adjacent pleura thickening. As the disease progresses, it can manifest as consolidation of the lungs in CT scan. We also found the age, smoking and hypertension may be risk factor for predicting the severity of COVID-19 in radiology., Conclusion: COVID-19 should be diagnosed based on the clinical feature, nCoV PCR test and radiological manifestation. The main manifestation of COVID-19 is peripheral ground glass opacity. Age, smoking and hypertension may be used to predict the severity of COVID-19. Chest CT is the important radiological method for screening and detecting COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The first wave of the London COVID-19 epidemic peaked in April 2020. Attention initially focused on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. While general practice has seen a rapid uptake of technology to allow for virtual consultations, little is known about the pattern of suspected COVID-19 presentations in primary care., AIM: To quantify the prevalence and time course of clinically suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices, to report the risk of suspected COVID-19 by ethnic group, and to identify whether differences by ethnicity can be explained by clinical data in the GP record., DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of approximately 1.2 million adults registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups. The study population includes 55% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England., METHOD: Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified clinically and recorded using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included data on 16 long-term conditions, body mass index, and smoking status., RESULTS: GPs recorded 8985 suspected COVID-19 cases between 10 February and 30 April 2020.Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in the odds of suspected COVID-19 for South Asian and black adults compared with white adults. In a fully adjusted analysis that included clinical factors, South Asian patients had nearly twice the odds of suspected infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83 to 2.04). The OR for black patients was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.38 to 1.57)., CONCLUSION: Using data from GP records, black and South Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of suspected COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission reports. Further understanding of these differences requires social and occupational data. Copyright ©The Authors.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objective: Clinical and laboratory biomarkers to predict the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential in this pandemic situation of which resource allocation must be urgently prepared especially in the context of respiratory support readiness. Lymphocyte count has been a marker of interest since the first COVID-19 publication. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association of lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of COVID-19. We would also like to analyze whether patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities affect the relationship between lymphocyte count and COVID-19., Methods: Comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, ProQuest, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar. Research articles in adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with information on lymphocyte count and several outcomes of interest, including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) care, and severe COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Inverse variance method was used to obtain mean differences and its standard deviations. Maentel-Haenszel formula was used to calculate dichotomous variables to obtain odds ratios (ORs) along with its 95% confidence intervals. Random-effect models were used for meta-analysis regardless of heterogeneity. Restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-regression was performed for age, gender, cardiac comorbidity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and smoking., Results: There were a total of 3099 patients from 24 studies. Meta-analysis showed that patients with poor outcome have a lower lymphocyte count (mean difference - 361.06 muL [- 439.18, - 282.95], p < 0.001; I 2 84%) compared to those with good outcome. Subgroup analysis showed lower lymphocyte count in patients who died (mean difference - 395.35 muL [- 165.64, - 625.07], p < 0.001; I 2 87%), experienced ARDS (mean difference - 377.56 muL [- 271.89, - 483.22], p < 0.001; I 2 0%), received ICU care (mean difference - 376.53 muL [- 682.84, - 70.22], p = 0.02; I 2 89%), and have severe COVID-19 (mean difference - 353.34 muL [- 250.94, - 455.73], p < 0.001; I 2 85%). Lymphopenia was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 3.70 [2.44, 5.63], p < 0.001; I 2 40%). Meta-regression showed that the association between lymphocyte count and composite poor outcome was affected by age (p = 0.034)., Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that lymphopenia on admission was associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition plays a critical role in the onset and progress of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19., METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 122 patients infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, China, a specialized infectious hospital affiliated with the Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI score was calculated as serum albumin (g/L) + 5 x total lymphocyte count (/nL)., RESULTS: The study population consisted of 105 patients (86.1%) with a common form and 17 patients (13.9%) with a severe form of COVID-19. PNI score significantly decreased from patients with common to severe forms of COVID-19 (P = .029) regardless of sex, age range, and body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P = .030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P = .402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into 3 disease severity groups (nonsevere, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression., RESULTS: Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age >65 years (P < .001), smoking (P = .001), critical disease status (P = .002), diabetes (P = .025), high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL, P = .02), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L, P < .001), and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L, P < .001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (P < .001), which was confirmed by survival analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was commonly reported in COVID-19 patients. However, the relationship between LDH and the incidence of severe cases has not been characterized in those patients. We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of patients from a designated isolation medical center for COVID-19 patients diagnosed from February 6 to March 1. Variables accessed within 48 hours on admission were compared between patients with and without the severe disease. Logistic model analyses were performed to examine the prognostic value of LDH for predicting severe disease.52 (28.6%) patients later developed severe disease. Comparing to non-severe cases, severe cases had a higher level of serum LDH (321.85 +/- 186.24 vs 647.35 +/- 424.26, P < .001), neutrophils (5.42 +/- 3.26 vs 9.19 +/- 6.33, P < .001), and C-reactive protein (38.63 +/- 43.14 vs 83.20 +/- 51.01, P < .001). The patients with severe disease tended to be male (44.6% vs 80.8%, P < .001), lower level of serum albumin (31.41 +/- 6.20 vs 27.18 +/- 5.74, P < .001), and SpO2 (96.30 +/- 2.75 vs 92.37 +/- 8.29, P < .001). In the multivariate analysis model, LDH and sex remained independent risk factors for severe disease. The serum LDH predicted severe cases with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7999. A combination of serum LDH and sex predicted severe cases with an AUC of 0.849. A combination of serum LDH accessed on admission and sex had a better predictive performance than the serum LDH (P = .0238). Serum LDH on admission combined with sex is independently associated with severe disease in COVID-19.

N2  - Background: Health disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations., Methods: We develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020., Findings: We estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR( t ) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR( t ) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits., Interpretation: The risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major threat to public health since the outbreak in Wuhan in 2019. Chest computed tomography is recommended for COVID-19 cases for evaluation and follow up of pneumonia and related complication. We report the case of a 66-year-old man with underlying hypertension and a history of smoking 76 packs a year; he was frequently monitored by computed tomography for pulmonary changes during the period from early symptom onset to death. Furthermore, he developed a pneumothorax during the course. The occurrence of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients is not common, and there have been only a few previous reports. This is a valuable case of pneumothorax in a patient with COVID-19 treated with a ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This case and previous reports suggest that pneumothorax occurs in COVID-19 with a relatively late onset (3-8 weeks). Long-term pneumonia morbidity, steroid therapy, positive pressure ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can cause pneumothorax, leading to capillary and alveolar damage.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap., METHODS: UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, and were asked to log their condition daily. Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of 'classic' symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers., RESULTS: Between 24 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, data were available on 2 401 982 participants, mean (SD) age 43.6 (15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834 437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to report symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.14 (1.10 to 1.18); >5 symptoms 1.29 (1.26 to 1.31); >10 symptoms 1.50 (1.42 to 1.58). The pattern of association between reported symptoms did not vary between smokers and non-smokers., INTERPRETATION: These data are consistent with people who smoke being at an increased risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19.

N2  - The aim of this study was to test how youth and young adult e-cigarette users responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Youth and Young Adult Vaping Survey (N = 1,308) included 540 (44.7%) participants that reported differences in their vaping behaviors since the onset of the pandemic. Gender was the only relevant covariate that yielded a significant effect and/or interaction through a multivariate test. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to test the effect of pandemic onset (pre- vs. during-pandemic), gender (males vs. females), and their interaction on vaping behaviors (days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode). Respondents reported fewer days of vaping per week, episodes of vaping per day, and puffs per vaping episode during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [F (3,533) = 52.81, p < 0.001, etap2 = 0.229]. The multivariate effect of gender on the three vaping outcomes was not statistically significant [F (3, 533) = 2.14, p = 0.095, etap2 = 0.012], though the interaction between pandemic onset and gender was [F (3, 533) = 2.86, p = 0.036, etap2 = 0.016]. Males reported fewer episodes of vaping per day [t (262) = 7.40, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 5.19-8.97] and puffs per vaping episode [t (263) = 3.23, p = 0.001, 95% CI:0.292-1.20] during-pandemic than pre-pandemic. Females reported fewer vaping episodes per day during-pandemic than pre-pandemic [t (273) = 5.14, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.76-6.18]. Further, females reported more frequent puffs per vaping episode in comparison to males during-pandemic [t (538) = -2.38, p = 0.017, 95% CI: -2.09-0.200]. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reduce vaping through health promotion messaging. Since females take more puffs per vaping episode overall, they may benefit the most from greater vaping cessation supports. Copyright © 2021 Hopkins and Al-Hamdani.

T1  - COVID-19 and heme oxygenase: novel insight into the disease and potential therapies.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic needs therapies that are presently available and safe. We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19's heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection's damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin. Controlled trials of these HO-1 inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes has been associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, but the association between modifiable risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and obesity, and COVID-19-related mortality among people with diabetes is unclear. We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes., METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England. National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models., FINDINGS: Weekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017-19 by 672 (50.9%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16 071 (64.3%) in people with type 2 diabetes. Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264 390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2 874 020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36 291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes. Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10 525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62.3%) and 5833 (55.4%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (6.5-7.0%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (10.0%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.23 [95% CI 1.50-3.30, p<0.0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1.61 [1.47-1.77, p<0.0001] in type 2 diabetes). In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (7.6%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (HR 1.22 [95% CI 1.15-1.30, p<0.0001] for 59-74 mmol/mol [7.6-8.9%] and 1.36 [1.24-1.50, p<0.0001] for 75-85 mmol/mol [9.0-9.9%]). The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 25.0-29.9 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 20.0 kg/m2 had an HR of 2.45 (95% CI 1.60-3.75, p<0.0001) and a BMI of 40.0 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 2.33 (1.53-3.56, p<0.0001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 2.33 (2.11-2.56, p<0.0001) and 1.60 (1.47-1.75, p<0.0001)., INTERPRETATION: Deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in England. Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI., FUNDING: None.

N2  - Objectives. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental distress in US adults. Methods. Participants were 5065 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet panel representative of the US adult population. The main exposure was survey completion date (March 10-16, 2020). The outcome was mental distress measured via the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. Results. Among states with 50 or more COVID-19 cases as of March 10, each additional day was significantly associated with an 11% increase in the odds of moving up a category of distress (odds ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.01, 1.21; P = .02). Perceptions about the likelihood of getting infected, death from the virus, and steps taken to avoid infecting others were associated with increased mental distress in the model that included all states. Individuals with higher consumption of alcohol or cannabis or with history of depressive symptoms were at significantly higher risk for mental distress. Conclusions. These data suggest that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mental distress may continue to increase and should be regularly monitored. Specific populations are at high risk for mental distress, particularly those with preexisting depressive symptoms.

N2  - Tobacco use is a possible risk factor for contracting and spreading COVID-19. We aimed to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Youth Quitline service and quitting behaviors of its users in Hong Kong. We conducted a telephone survey involving 201 participants of the Youth Quitline service, and retrospectively analyzed the operation and use of Quitline since the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. The number of incoming calls to the Youth Quitline and the participants' quit rate has increased since the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Many participants (68%) did not realize that tobacco use potentially increased their risk for developing and spreading COVID-19; however, 43% agreed that the pandemic motivated their intention to quit, and 83% changed their smoking habits during the pandemic. These changes were mainly due to wearing masks (30%), closure of bars/pubs (25%), suspension of classes (14%), and being unable to socialize with friends (24%). Overall, 58% reduced their tobacco use; of these participants, 66% reported a >=50% reduction in daily cigarette consumption. The participants reduced their smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic despite lacking knowledge about the potentially increased risk for contracting COVID-19 from continued smoking. The pandemic could create new opportunities to motivate young smokers to quit smoking, especially those seeking support for smoking cessation, and may further contribute to reducing the risks posed by COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Data is conflicting regarding the impact of tobacco smoking in people with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19)., METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study of 9,991 consecutive patients hospitalized in a major New York academic centre between March 7th and June 5th, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The clinical outcomes assessed included risk of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for mechanical ventilation among smokers (current and former). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score models were built to adjust for potential confounders., FINDINGS: Among 9,991 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 2,212 (22.1%) patients were self-reported smokers (406 current and 1806 former). Current smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (propensity score [PS]-adjusted OR 0.91; p=0.46), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.77; p=0.12), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.18; p=0.37), or intubation (PS-OR 1.04; p=0.85). Similarly, former smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.88; p=0.11), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.78), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.95), or intubation (PS-OR 0.93; p=0.57). Furthermore, smoking (current or former) was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.85; p=0.05), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.94; p=0.49), ICU admission (PS-OR 0.86; p=0.17), or intubation (PS-OR 0.79; p=0.06)., INTERPRETATION: Smoking is a well-known risk factor associated with greater susceptibility and subsequent increased severity of respiratory infections. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers may have increased risk and severe pneumonia. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers are believed to have an increased risk of mortality as well as severe pneumonia. However, in our analysis of real-world clinical data, smoking was not associated with increased in-patient mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, in accordance with prior reports.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19, and compared them to risk factors for pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank., DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: UK Biobank., PARTICIPANTS: 49-83 year olds (in 2020) from a general population study., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes., RESULTS: Among 235 928 participants, 397 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index and higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (RR 1.28 and RR 1.14 per SD increase, respectively), smoking (RR 1.39), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.53), and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.33). Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were both associated with lower risk (RR 0.84 and RR 0.83 per SD increase, respectively). Non-modifiable risk factors included male sex (RR 1.72), black ethnicity (RR 2.00), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.17 per SD increase in Townsend Index), and high cystatin C (RR 1.13 per SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat, less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

T1  - Interleukin 6 in inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer.
A1  - Hirano, Toshio
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved both in immune responses and in inflammation, hematopoiesis, bone metabolism and embryonic development. IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune cells and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-kappaB and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-kappaB followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is a NF-kappaB target, simultaneous activation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-kappaB activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

T1  - Sexual Orientation Disparities in Risk Factors for Adverse COVID-19-Related Outcomes, by Race/Ethnicity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2017-2019.
A1  - Heslin, Kevin C

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Sexual minority persons experience health disparities associated with sexual stigma and discrimination and have a high prevalence of several health conditions that have been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). Current COVID-19 surveillance systems do not capture information about sexual orientation. To begin bridging the gap in knowledge about COVID-19 risk among sexual minority adults, CDC examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults in the prevalence of underlying conditions with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe COVID-19-related illness (3), by using data from the 2017-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). * When age, sex, and survey year are adjusted, sexual minority persons have higher prevalences than do heterosexual persons of self-reported cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease (including myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease), obesity, smoking, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and stroke. Sexual minority adults who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic also have higher prevalences of several of these health conditions than do racial/ethnic minority adults who are heterosexual. Collecting data on sexual orientation in COVID-19 surveillance and other studies would improve knowledge about disparities in infection and adverse outcomes by sexual orientation, thereby informing more equitable responses to the pandemic.

T1  - Obesity is the comorbidity more strongly associated for Covid-19 in Mexico. A case-control study.
A1  - Hernandez-Garduno, Eduardo
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Some comorbidities are associated with severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) but it is unclear whether some increase susceptibility to Covid-19. In this case-control Mexican study we found that obesity represents the strongest predictor for Covid-19 followed by diabetes and hypertension in both sexes and chronic renal failure in females only. Active smoking was associated with decreased odds of Covid-19. These findings indicate that these comorbidities are not only associated with severity of disease but also predispose for getting Covid-19. Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in each comorbidity and the apparent "protective" effect of cigarette smoking.

N2  - The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases. BCG vaccination has recently been proposed as a strategy to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, supported by its potential to boost innate immunity and initial epidemiological analyses which observed reduced severity of COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccination policies. Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our epidemiological findings do not provide evidence to correlate overall BCG vaccination policy with the spread of CoV-2 and its associated mortality.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the world is currently facing high morbidity and mortality rates as well as severe disruption to normal societal and social structures. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In a recent publication of The Journal of Pathology, Liu and coworkers highlight the effects of cigarette smoking on ACE2 expression in the respiratory epithelium. The authors studied the effects of acute cigarette smoke exposure in a murine model and confirmed their findings in human lung tissues and gene expression datasets. Their findings demonstrate that cigarette smoking increases ACE2 expression specifically at the apical surface of the airway epithelium. Smoking cessation resulted in lower ACE2 expression, with implications for attenuating the risk of transmission of the virus. The role of ACE2 expression in the development of COVID-19 symptoms is still under investigation, with conflicting results from experimental models on the role of ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury. In this commentary, we highlight the implications and limitations of the study of Liu et al as well as future therapeutic strategies directed towards ACE2. © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - It has long been suggested that NO may inhibit an early stage in viral replication. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Despite smoking being listed as a risk factor to contract Covid-19, only a low proportion of the smokers suffered from SARS-corona infection in China 2003, and from Covid-19 in China, Europe and the US. We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO2 concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO. Specialized iNO machines can now be developed to provide the drug intermittently in short bursts at high concentration dose, which would then provide both a preventative drug for those at high risk, as well as an effective treatment, without the health hazards associated with smoking.

T1  - Chest pain and high troponin level without significant respiratory symptoms in young patients with COVID-19.
A1  - Hedayat, Behnam

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: Of all patients infected with COVID-19, 95% have mild symptoms, but 5% may experience severe illness. There are reports of myocardial injury associated with the COVID19 infection in middle-aged and old people with baseline cardiac conditions. Acute myocardial injury has been suggested as a marker for disease severity. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between acute coronary syndrome and acute myocarditis; hence detailed history taking, lab tests and imaging will be necessary., Case Presentation: Herein, we described two young patients presenting with chest pain and no significant respiratory symptoms, one without cardiovascular risk factors and another one with diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. COVID-19 was documented with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)., Conclusion: Early Chest CT scan besides coronary CT angiogram (if available) in suspicious cases can help physician to make fast decisions. These two cases both had complication-free hospital stay. Despite markedly high on-admission troponin levels, which is known as a marker of poor prognosis they discharged in good condition. One month follow-up was also uneventful.

T1  - Electrostatic fine particles emitted from laser printers as potential vectors for airborne transmission of COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 14 million people globally. Recently, airborne transmission has been postulated to be a major contributor to the spread of the novel coronavirus, especially in enclosed public spaces. While many studies have demonstrated positive correlations between atmospheric pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of indoor air pollutants on airborne transmission has been largely overlooked. In particular, laser printers are a primary source of particle emission that increases the concentrations of particulate matter in indoor atmosphere by releasing substantial quantities of electrostatic fine particles, at rates comparable with tobacco smoking and incense burning. We hypothesized that particles emitted from laser printers present a potential risk factor for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in offices and other indoor environments with high user occupancy. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed recent knowledge on the characteristics of particles emitted by laser printing, including their emission rates and accumulation in indoor air, electrostatic charges, localized emission and subsequent particle diffusion in relation to the human breathing zone. We then discuss the potential impact on the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 in indoor spaces. We found that emission rates from laser printers ranged from 108 to 1012 particles min-1, and these fine particles typically remain suspended for prolonged periods in indoor air. Electrostatic charges carried by these particles can reach 260-379 e per particle, thus enhancing their surface adsorption and deposition in human airways. Localized emission by laser printers and subsequent diffusion highly increase particle concentrations near the human breathing zone. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

N2  - Objective: During the follow-up of patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the quarantine and observation period, some of the cured patients showed positive results again. The recurrent positive RT-PCR test results drew widespread concern. We observed a certain number of cured COVID-19 patients with positive RT-PCR test results and try to analyze the factors that caused the phenomenon., Methods: We conducted an observational study in COVID-19 patients discharged from 6 rehabilitation stations in Wuhan, China. All observed subjects met the criteria for hospital discharge and were in quarantine. Data regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI), course of disease, comorbidity, smoking status and alcohol consumption, symptoms in and out of quarantine, and intervention were collected from the subjects' medical records and descriptively analyzed. The main outcome of this study was the RT-PCR test result of the observed subjects at the end of quarantine (negative or positive). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors related to recurrent positive RT-PCR test results., Results: In this observational study, 420 observed subjects recovered from COVID-19 were included. The median age was 56 years, 63.6% of the subjects were above 50 years old, and 50.7% (213/420) were female. The most common comorbidities were hypertension [26.4% (111/420)], hyperlipidemia [10.7% (45/420)], and diabetes [10.5% (44/420)]. 54.8% (230/420) manifested one or more symptoms at the beginning of the observation period, the most common symptoms were cough [27.6% (116/420)], shortness of breath 23.8% (100/420)], and fatigue [16.2% (68/420)], with fever rare [2.6% (11/420)]. A total of 325 subjects were exposed to comprehensive intervention; 95 subjects were absence of intervention. The recurrence rate of positive RT-PCR test results with comprehensive intervention was 2.8% (9/325), and that with no intervention was 15.8% (15/95). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusted for factors such as age, sex, and comorbidity and found out that comprehensive intervention was correlated with the recurrent positive RT-PCR test results. There was appreciably less recurrence in the comprehensive intervention group., Conclusions: The factors related to positive RT-PCR test results in observed subjects recovered from COVID-19 were age, comorbidity, and comprehensive intervention, among which comprehensive intervention might be a protective factor., Clinical Trial Registration: Chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2000030747.

T1  - Endothelial activation and dysfunction in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and coronavirus disease 2019.
A1  - Hayden, Melvin R
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is a serious global concern. Increased morbidity and mortality is associated with older age, male gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking. As COVID-19 spreads from coastal borders, both state to state and country to country, our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved. Age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play especially important roles in COVID-19 progression. T2DM is an age-related disease associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and endothelial activation and dysfunction. This review evaluates the relationships and intersection between endothelial cell activation and dysfunction in T2DM and COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple injuries of the terminal bronchioles and alveolar blood-gas barrier and associated ultrastructural tissue remodeling. COVID-19 may unmask multiple vulnerabilities associated with T2DM including damage to the endothelial glycocalyx and multiple end-organ macro and microvascular diseases. Unmasking existing vulnerabilities in diabetic patients with COVID-19 is important. Globally, we must come together to better understand why T2DM is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Precision Aging R is a novel concept that we have recently employed to describe how the model of precision medicine can be used to understand and define the multivariate risks that drive age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI). Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are key risk factors for both brain function and cognitive aging. In this review, we will discuss the common mechanisms underlying the risk factors for both hypertension and ARCI and how the convergence of these mechanisms may be amplified in an individual to drive changes in brain health and accelerate cognitive decline., RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, our cognitive health span does not match our life span. Age-related cognitive impairment and preventing and treating ARCI will require an in-depth understanding of the interrelated risk factors, including individual genetic profiles, that affect brain health and brain aging. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are important risk factors for ARCI. And, many of the risk factors for developing hypertension, such as diabetes, smoking, stress, viral infection, and age, are shared with the development of ARCI. We must first understand the mechanisms common to the converging risk factors in hypertension and ARCI and then design person-specific therapies to optimize individual brain health. The understanding of the convergence of shared risk factors between hypertension and ARCI is required to develop individualized interventions to optimize brain health across the life span. We will conclude with a discussion of possible steps that may be taken to decrease ARCI and optimize an individual's cognitive life span.

N2  - Behavioral and life style factors plausibly play a role in likelihood of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Genetic vulnerability to hospitalization after SARS-CoV2 infection may partially relate to comorbid behavioral risk factors, especially the use of combustible psychoactive substances. Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis has been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. By leveraging genome-wide association summary statistics of CUD and COVID-19, we find that at least 1/3 rd of the genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 overlaps with genomic liability to CUD (rg=.34, p=0.0003). Genetic causality as a potential mechanism of risk could not be excluded. The association between CUD and COVID-19 remained when accounting for genetics of trying marijuana, tobacco smoking (ever smoking regularly, cigarettes per day, smoking cessation, age of smoking initiation), BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, and Townsend deprivation index. Heavy problematic cannabis use may increase chances of hospitalization due to COVID-19 respiratory complications. Curbing excessive cannabis use may be an essential strategy in COVID-19 mitigation.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - COVID-19 a systemic inflammation involving multiple organs, affecting all age groups, with high mortality rate, severe adverse outcomes, and high economic burden need to be described. A systematic review of systematic reviews conducted. We searched PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane library, COVID-19 resource centers of N Engl. J Med, AHA, and LITCOVID. Certainty of evidences was evaluated by GRADE approach. Meta-analysis according to random effects model was conducted. Seventy-one eligible systematic reviews are included in the study. A total of 86.5% of them had high quality, and 13.5% had medium quality. Meta-analysis results are presented in tabular format, and the remaining results are presented in narration fashion. COVID-19 involves blood vessels, lung, heart, nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal system, kidney, eyes, and other organs and infects adult and children, neonates, pregnant women, and elderly, transmitted via air born and droplet. Comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are HTN 20.7%, CVD 9.6%, DM 9.55%, respiratory diseases 7%, and 9% of cigarette smoking. Prognostic factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases are acute cardiac injury, diagnosed CVD, DM, respiratory disease, and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease severity are CVD and HTN. Prognostic factors for disease progression were fever, shortness of breath, and smoking. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Preventive measures including physical distancing of 2 m and more, using PPE, avoiding social gatherings, quarantine, and isolation have been recommended. Encouraging telemedicine, online training, and homeschooling are highly recommended. Vaccine is approaching, and concerns exist about vaccine with a high efficacy. Modification of CVD and cardiometabolic risk became the cornerstone for sustainable control of pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a complex inflammatory syndrome predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. The clinical and laboratory profile can easily mimic infectious and noninfectious conditions. The exclusion of these conditions is essential to establish the diagnosis. Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C knowledge is evolving. The current criteria to establish the diagnosis are not specific and have overlapping features with EVALI, making the accurate diagnosis a clinical challenge during continued COVID-19 transmission within the community., CASE REPORT: Three young adults evaluated at our emergency department for prolonged fever and gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were initially assessed for possible MIS-C due to epidemiologic links to COVID-19 and were eventually diagnosed with EVALI. The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of both entities are explored, as well as the appropriate medical management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Physician awareness of overlapping and differentiating EVALI and MIS-C features is essential to direct appropriate diagnostic evaluation and medical management of adolescents and young adults presenting with systemic inflammatory response during the unfolding pandemic of COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Introduction: Nigeria is the most populous country in the African continent. The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria., Methods: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age >=65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model., Results: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR., Conclusion: this study indicates that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain States in Nigeria. Population susceptibility factors include higher economic development but not literacy or unemployment. Death rates were mildly lower in States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG vaccination coverage. Copyright: Zubaida Hassan et al.

T1  - An urgent impetus for action: safe inhalation interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission and fatality risk among people who smoke crack cocaine in the United Kingdom.
A1  - Harris, Magdalena
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Crack cocaine use is rising in the United Kingdom (UK), with smoking the primary form of administration. Provision of safe inhalation equipment for crack cocaine is prohibited under UK law. Pipes used for crack cocaine smoking are often homemade and/or in short supply, exacerbating COVID-19 transmission and respiratory risk. This is of concern, given high prevalence of respiratory health harms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among people who smoke illegal drugs. This commentary draws on scoping review and mixed method empirical evidence to argue for provision of safe crack inhalation equipment in the UK, with commensurate legal reform. Review of crack inhalation interventions illustrates the health protective and service engagement benefits of smoking equipment supply. Survey data generated with 455 people who inject drugs in London illustrate high prevalence of current crack use (66%, n=299). Qualitative accounts illustrate perceptions of relative smoking safety - alongside accounts of severe respiratory-related health harms. To date, injecting drug use has been of primary concern in relation to harm reduction initiatives. It is crucial that people who smoke illegal drugs are considered a vulnerable population in regard to COVID 19 transmission and fatality risk, with innovative harm reduction measures scaled up in response.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized., METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level >35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared., RESULTS: Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 47.0 [35.0-55.0] years; 40.5% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2-6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11-16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups., DISCUSSION: We found that 28.2% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels on admission, which could partially be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male patients had a higher risk of liver enzyme level elevation. With early medical intervention, liver enzyme level elevation did not worsen the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.

N2  - RATIONALE: Currently, COVID-19 has made a significant impact on many countries in the world. However, there have been no reported cases of pulmonary lobectomy with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection. We are the first to report such a case., PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 63-year-old Wuhan male patient with smoking history of 40 cigarettes per day for 40 years. He sought medical consultation for right lower lung nodules found by CT scan., DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: The patient's postoperative pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lung. On the fourth day after the operation, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test showed a positive result. After the operation, we routinely give symptomatic treatments such as anti-infection, nebulization and oxygen inhalation. We also change antibiotics several times depending on the patient's condition., OUTCOMES: The patient's condition continued to deteriorate. On the fifth day after surgery, the patient died despite medical treatment., LESSONS: We are the first to report the diagnosis and treatment process of patients with COVID-19 during perioperative period of lobectomy. It provides a case for the postoperative management of such patients.

N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the least deadly but most infectious coronavirus strain transmitted from wild animals. It may affect many organ systems. Aim of the current guideline is to delineate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver. Asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations are common in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Its pathogenesis may be multifactorial. It may involve primary liver injury and indirect effects such as "bystander hepatitis," myositis, toxic liver injury, hypoxia, and preexisting liver disease. Higher aminotransferase elevations, lower albumin, and platelets have been reported in severe compared with mild COVID-19. Despite the dominance of respiratory disease, acute on chronic liver disease/acute hepatic decompensation have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting liver disease, in particular cirrhosis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has a higher risk of respiratory disease progression than those without MAFLD. Alcohol-associated liver disease may be severely affected by COVID-19-such patients frequently have comorbidities including metabolic syndrome and smoking-induced chronic lung disease. World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) recommends that interventional procedures such as endoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed in emergency cases or when they are considered strictly necessary such as high risk varices or cholangitis. Hepatocellular cancer surveillance may be postponed by 2 to 3 months. A short delay in treatment initiation and non-surgical approaches should be considered. Liver transplantation should be restricted to patients with high MELD scores, acute liver failure and hepatocellular cancer within Milan criteria. Donors and recipients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 and if found positive donors should be excluded and liver transplantation postponed until recovery from infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: ACE2 has been identified as the entry receptor for coronaviruses into human cells, including SARS-COV-2 that causes COVID-19. Since hypertension is a leading comorbidity in non-survivors of COVID-19, we tested for association between ACE2 gene and hypertension in interaction with specific pre-existing conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 severity., METHODS: Genetic analysis of ACE2 gene was conducted in French-Canadian and British populations., RESULTS: In French-Canadian individuals, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2074192 of ACE2 gene was a risk factor for hypertension in adult obese males [odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.83)] and even more so in obese males who smoked (OR=1.67, CI: 1.24-2.55), but not in lean males, non-smoker males or females. The T allele was significantly associated with severity of hypertension and with earlier penetrance of hypertension in obese smoking males. Significant interaction between the T allele and obesity was present in both sexes. The association of ACE2 (rs233575) genotype with blood pressure was also seen in adolescents but the interaction with obesity was present only in females. Several variants in ACE2 gene were found to be associated with hypertension in obese, smoking males in British individuals of the UK Biobank. In addition, we observed more severe outcomes to COVID-19 in association with ACE2 risk alleles in obese, smoking males., CONCLUSION: This is the first report that ACE2 variants are associated with earlier penetrance and more severe hypertension and with more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in obese smoking males.

N2  - Aims: It is important to identify characteristics of people who may be most at risk of COVID-19 to inform policy and intervention. Little is known about the impact of unhealthy lifestyles including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake. We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for COVID-19., Methods: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 +/-8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020., Results: There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52 - 7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19., Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, accounting for up to half of severe cases. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.

N2  - We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake) for COVID-19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage to hospitalisation. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 +/- 8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52-7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10-16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore knowledge and attitude about Covid-19, among Syrian refugee mothers in the Governorate of Irbid, where the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Jordan took place., METHODS: This is a cross-section study among Syrian refugee mothers, who were pregnant or having had children. Data was collected through an online questionnaire. The survey link was distributed in April 2020, through the social network's messaging services Facebook and WhatsApp. Contact information was obtained from local community centres and non-governmental organisations in the town of Irbid, the north of Jordan., RESULTS: In total, 389 Syrian refugee mothers participated in the study. It showed that 66% of mother's access information regarding Covid-19. The main sources of information were Facebook 87%, WhatsApp 69%, television 53%, while 21% indicated that they access professional databases or government websites. In general, Syrian refugee mothers were knowledgeable about Covid-19 transmission and prevention. However, they lacked adequate knowledge about transmission of Covid-19 between the mother and the child, and smoking risks associated with Covid-19., CONCLUSIONS: There are gaps in the knowledge and attitude of Syrian refugee mothers in the Governorate of Irbid in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a need for further health education measures. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have flagged racial and ethnic differences in health outcomes in western countries as an urgent global public health priority. Kuwait has a unique demographic profile with two-thirds of the population consisting of non-nationals, most of which are migrant workers. We aimed to explore whether there is a significant difference in health outcomes between non-Kuwaiti and Kuwaiti patients diagnosed with COVID-19., METHODS: We used a prospective COVID-19 registry of all patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in Kuwait who tested positive from February 24th to April 20th, 2020, collected from Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, the officially-designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in the country. We ran separate logistic regression models comparing non-Kuwaitis to Kuwaitis for death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia., RESULTS: The first 1123 COVID-19 positive patients in Kuwait were all recruited in the study. About 26% were Kuwaitis and 73% were non-Kuwaiti. With adjustments made to age, gender, smoking and selected co-morbidities, non-Kuwaitis had two-fold increase in the odds of death or being admitted to the intensive care unit compared to Kuwaitis (OR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.12-4.32). Non-Kuwaitis had also higher odds of ARDS (OR:2.44, 95% CI 1.23-5.09) and pneumonia (OR: 2.24, 95% CI 1.27-4.12)., CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report on COVID-19 outcomes between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti patients. The current pandemic may have amplified the differences of health outcomes among marginalized subpopulations. A number of socioeconomic and environmental factors could explain this health disparity. More research is needed to advance the understanding of policymakers in Kuwait in order to make urgent public health interventions.

N2  - Vulnerable adolescents may lose control over cigarette use within a day or two after smoking their first cigarette, as nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms may appear before actual daily smoking and usually occur at low levels of daily smoking. Moreover, smoking can cause illnesses and promote other types of substance abuse. Therefore, it was deemed essential to adapt the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale to develop and validate the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) in Lebanese adolescents and evaluate whether cumulative cigarette smoking is associated with nicotine dependence and symptoms of dependence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, during the partial sanitary lockdown imposed by the government to limit COVID-19, coinciding with the summer holidays for most Lebanese. The total sample consisted of 564 community-dwelling adolescents aged 13 to 18. A factor analysis was performed using a varimax rotation. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's sphericity test were appropriate. The factors retained corresponded to Eigenvalues > 1. Cronbach's alpha value represented the internal consistency of the scale. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) was used to screen for dependence symptoms. All items of the YACD were extracted, except for items 4 (smoking to concentrate at work) and 18 (smoking as a habit), which yielded a three-factor solution (factor 1 = smoking patterns; factor 2 = positive and negative reinforcements; factor 3 = smoking cessation) with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 56.18%; KMO = 0.784; Bartlett's sphericity test p < 0.001; alphaCronbach = 0.875). The newly generated scale was termed Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) and consisted of 19 items. Higher ACDS scores (higher cigarette dependence) were significantly associated with higher HONC scores (higher symptoms of dependence) (rho = 0.647; p < 0.001). Having deceased (B = 8.54) or divorced (B = 4.26) parents and higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.29) were significantly associated with higher ACDS scores. Higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.05) was significantly associated with higher HONC scores due to cigarettes. This study could validate a new tool to evaluate nicotine dependence among Lebanese adolescents, the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS). This version adapted from the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale is reliable and valuable and correlates well with other scales, such as the HONC. However, further studies are necessary to improve this instrument, adding new questions useful for the diagnosis and evaluation of cigarette dependence.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We studied clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients living with HIV (PLH) in comparison to non-HIV population., DESIGN: Analysis of a multicentre research network TriNETX was performed including patients more than 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19., METHODS: Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH)., RESULTS: Fifty thousand one hundred and sixty-seven patients with COVID-19 were identified (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be men, African-American, obese and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nicotine dependence compared with non-PLH cohort (all P values <0.05). We performed 1 : 1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and sex. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days [risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.01-2.39] and were more likely to need inpatient services (risk ratio 1.83, 95% CI: 1.496-2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (risk ratio 1.33, 95% CI: 0.69-2.57). A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31 vs. 11.39%, risk ratio 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21-2.38). Mean C-reactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with a history of antiretroviral treatment., CONCLUSION: Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensity-matched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and intensive surveillance are needed to prevent a 'Syndemic' of diseases in this vulnerable cohort.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affecting the lungs. All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations., METHOD: Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020., RESULTS: Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration., CONCLUSIONS: Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.

N2  - Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that can cause disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and animals. Lately, a new coronavirus causing pneumonia cases was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Soon after, the name of the virus was identified as the "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2", and the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In our country, the first cases began to appear in the second week of March. In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographic characteristics and risk factors of patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 100 patients (53 female and 47 male) were included in our study. The patients included in the study were randomly selected from the registration system and their information was evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.42 (Age range= 20-90). When the risk factors for catching the disease were evaluated; it was determined that there was at least one risk factor in 46 patients; 30 patients had close contact with the COVID-19 patient in the social environment (30%) and 16 patients had a travel history outside the city in the last 14 days (16%). The most common symptoms in our patients were; cough (93%), fever (42%), dyspnea (22%), weakness (8%), sore throat (7%), diarrhea (6%), headache (5%) and sputum (2%). The most common comorbid conditions in our patients were detected as hypertension (42%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (21%), congestive heart failure (10%), allergic asthma (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6%), rheumatoid arthritis (3%), coronary artery disease (2%), solid organ tumour (2%), depression (1%) and epilepsy (1%). The mean age of our 15 patients who were monitored in intensive care unit was 65 y (+/- 11.46), the mean age of 85 patients followed in the service was 52.55 (+/- 16.35) and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.006). When these two groups were compared in terms of comorbid diseases, the presence of DM was 40% higher (n= 6) in intensive care patients, and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.05). In addition, the majority [11 patients (73%)] of the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit were male (p= 0.03). When smoking was evaluated as a risk factor for serious illness, 4 of 11 patients (26%) in intensive care unit had a smoking history, while none of the patients who have died due to COVID-19 had a smoking history. These findings suggested to us that smoking does not increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. As a result, knowledge about the disease should be increased rapidly by sharing the studies on risk factors, transmission routes and clinical features of COVID-19 infection, which affects the whole world.

N2  - Twenty-five patients with chronic bronchitis were studied intensively from 1968 to 1972. Viral, bacteriologic, mycologic, and mycoplasmal studies, both serologic and cultural, were carried out in an attempt to determine the role these agents play in exacerbations. All of the usual viral agents associated with exacerbations and 2 members of the coronavirus group, 229E and OC43, were detected. One third (33.6 per cent) of the 116 exacerbations observed could be related to viral infection or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1 exacerbation). Viral infection was also noted to occur during periods of remission but was more commonly associated with periods of exacerbation(P less than 0.001). No interrelationship between viral and bacterial infection was apparent and neither Streptococcus pneumoniae nor Haemophilus influenzae was present more frequently in the sputum of patients in exacerbation. However, the number of S. pneumoniae organisms present in the sputum was significantly greater (P=0.04) during exacerbation than during remission and their presence was significatnly correlated with increases sputum purulence (P LESS THAN 0.01). This was not true of H. influenzae. Ampicillin was effective in clearing the sputum of S. pneumoniae but not of H. influenzae; the reverse was true of tetracycline.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2) and was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019, but quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic. While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach., Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing nonsevere and severe patients were included. Nonsevere cases were described as mild, common type, nonintensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and nonsurvivors., Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P < .001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P < .008). In 10.7% (978/9067) of nonsmokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases., Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking. The trial is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42020180173. Copyright © 2020 Askin Gulsen et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to determine the prevalence of current and past SARS-CoV-2 infections among police employees., METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 5082 police employees from Mazowieckie Province, Poland. RT-PCR testing for current SARS-CoV-2 infection and serological tests (ELISA) for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA and IgG antibodies were performed., RESULTS: All RT-PCR tests were negative. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM+IgA index was positive (>8) in 8.9% of participants, including 11.2% women and 7.7% men (p < 0.001). Equivocal IgM+IgA index (6-8) was found in 9.8% of participants, including 11.9% women and 8.7% men (p < 0.001). The IgG index was positive (>6) in 4.3% and equivocal (4-6) in 13.2% of participants. A higher odds of positive IgM+IgA index was found in women vs. men (OR: 1.742) and police officers vs. civilian employees (OR: 1.411). Participants aged >=60 years had a higher odds of positive IgG index vs. those aged 20-29 years (OR: 3.309). Daily vaping also increased the odds of positive IgG index (OR: 2.058)., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Polish police employees are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaping and older age (>=60 years) were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

N2  - Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) may be at an increased risk of a severe course due to cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CLD in COVID-19 patients and to analyze the course of the infection, compared with patients with non-liver disease. Material This was a retrospective single center study of all patients with a positive SARS-Cov2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from March 23 to April 30, 2020. Clinical and biochemical data of patients with and without CLD and COVID-19 were collected from the medical records. Result 447 patients with a SARS-Cov2 positive PCR were included, 6.3% had CLD. 69.7% of patients with CLD were male, with a median age of 65.5 years and active alcohol consumption and smoking 75% had non-advanced liver fibrosis and most were Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The hospital admission rate (92.9% vs 47.7% p<0.001), concomitant comorbidities (diabetes 38.5 vs 16.5% p=0.011; obesity 30.8 vs 8.5% p=0.033; cancer 23.1 vs 5% p=0.027 and COPD 19.2 vs 9% p=0.009) and concomitant antibiotics treatment (19.3 vs 5%; p= 0.018) were higher in patients with CLD than those without CLD. In-patient hospital mortality rate were similar in both groups (30.8 vs 19.6% p=0.289). The presence of CLD was not associated with mortality (OR= 1.06; 95% IC= 0.35- 3.18; p=0.924). However, patients with CLD and COVID-19 who were male, obese or under concomitant antibiotic treatment had the highest risk of mortality according to the univariate analysis. Conclusion Patients with CLD had a higher risk of hospital admission, with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 infection associated to other concomitant comorbidities and a suspicion of bacterial co-infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status., METHODS: We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities., RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9 years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424-5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03-2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07-2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60-7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 1.79 (1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities., CONCLUSION: Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. Copyright ©ERS 2020.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Blacks/African-Americans are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors., OBJECTIVE: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes., DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups., SETTING: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020., PARTICIPANTS: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score., RESULTS: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.62-4.02; P<.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pre-existing type II diabetes/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.

N2  - Importance: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration., Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics., Exposure: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription-PCR tests performed in external labs., Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs)., Results: Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P = .009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P = .02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P = .02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P < .001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P = .04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P < .001; P for interaction = .02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P = .005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P = .53; P for interaction = .04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P = .001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P = .88; P for interaction = .02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P < .001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P = .59; P for interaction = .046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis., Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in high-population density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. Associations of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: There has been significant speculation regarding the association between the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and smoking. We provide an overview of the available literature regarding the association between smoking, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and risk of severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcomes, with the aim of informing public health policy and practice, particularly in England., METHODS: Publications were identified utilising a systematic search approach on PUBMED and Google Scholar. Publications presenting a systematic review or meta-analysis considering the association between smoking and SARS-COV-2 infection or COVID-19 outcomes were included., RESULTS: Eight studies were identified. One considered the relationship between smoking and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, three considered the association between COVID-19 hospitalisation and smoking history, and six reviewed the association between smoking history and development of severe COVID-19. One study specifically investigated the risk of mortality. The studies considering risk of severe disease indicate that there is a significant association between COVID-19 and current or ever smoking., CONCLUSIONS: This is a rapidly evolving topic. Current analysis remains limited due to the quality of primary data, although, early results indicate an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity. We highly recommend public health messaging to continue focusing on smoking cessation efforts. Copyright © 2020 Grundy E.J. et al.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The pace and scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with ongoing efforts by health agencies to communicate harms, have created a pressing need for data to inform messaging about smoking, vaping, and COVID-19. We examined reactions to COVID-19 and traditional health harms messages discouraging smoking and vaping., METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 810 US adults recruited online in May 2020. All participated in a smoking message experiment and a vaping message experiment, presented in a random order. In each experiment, participants viewed one message formatted as a Twitter post. The experiments adopted a 3 (traditional health harms of smoking or vaping: three harms, one harm, absent) x 2 (COVID-19 harms: one harm, absent) between-subjects design. Outcomes included perceived message effectiveness (primary) and constructs from the Tobacco Warnings Model (secondary: attention, negative affect, cognitive elaboration, social interactions)., RESULTS: Smoking messages with traditional or COVID-19 harms elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging smoking than control messages without these harms (all p <0.001). However, including both traditional and COVID-19 harms in smoking messages had no benefit beyond including either alone. Smoking messages affected Tobacco Warnings Model constructs and did not elicit more reactance than control messages. Smoking messages also elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping. Including traditional harms in messages about vaping elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping (p <0.05), but including COVID-19 harms did not., CONCLUSIONS: Messages linking smoking with COVID-19 may hold promise for discouraging smoking and may have the added benefit of also discouraging vaping.

N2  - Entire world is battling the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. India too, has undertaken stringent containment measures to combat this disease. The country is in a state of national lockdown, which has inadvertently led more than a quarter of the Indian population to not use tobacco. This paper discusses the opportunity that surfaces with unavailability of tobacco products, and advocates the need for escalation of tobacco cessation services as well as strategic management of stress to stay tobacco-free.

N2  - Objective. This study was designed to investigate UK smokers' accounts of impacts of COVID-19 on their smoking, to develop implications for supporting smoking cessation. Design. One hundred and thirty-two smokers aged 19-52 years (mean age 25 years), recruited through an advert distributed through social media and a dedicated Twitter page, completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures. Smokers produced written accounts of how COVID-19 had impacted their smoking. Responses were of unlimited length and completed online 22nd May-22nd June 2020 during UK COVID-19 lockdown. Results. Inductive thematic analysis generated three themes: i) increased smoking as a coping mechanism to deal with anxiety, boredom, stress, and anger in COVID-19 lockdown; ii) lockdown as enabling quitting through lifting social barriers and enabling a focus on health benefits; and iii) no change, avoiding Government/media COVID-19 information due to disbelief, lack of trust, and perceptions of bias. Conclusions. Results demonstrate a need for credible public health messaging on COVID-19 risk aimed at smokers. Implications for supporting smoking cessation are discussed, including maintaining quitting in those "social smokers" who quit during lockdown, and support on stress-management and emotion regulation in those who use smoking as a way to cope with stress, anger, and boredom.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Bronchial asthma has not been adequately assessed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Respiratory allergy is associated with significant reductions in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is the entry receptor for COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: To observe COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with bronchial asthma, analyze the prevalence of asthma in a large cohort of consecutive outpatient subjects who were tested with the RT-PCR assay for COVID-19., METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using data from a large nationwide health maintenance organization in Israel. All health maintenance organization enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the subjects with negative and positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and between COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive subjects with and without asthma were analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 37,469 subjects were tested for COVID-19 RT-PCR, and results for 2,266 (6.05%) of them were positive. A significantly higher proportion of smokers was observed in the COVID-19-negative group than in the COVID-19-positive group (4734 [13.45%] vs 103 [4.55%]; P < .001). Asthma was found in 153 (6.75 %) subjects of the COVID-19-positive group and in 3388 (9.62%) subjects of the COVID-19-negative group (P < .001). No significant impact of antileukotrienes, inhaled corticosteroids, and long-acting beta-blockers use was revealed on COVID-19 positivity proportions. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, smoking, and comorbidity revealed a negative association of asthma with the likelihood of being positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87; P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed lower COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with preexisting asthma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clozapine, an antipsychotic with unique efficacy in treatment-resistant psychosis, is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, including pneumonia., AIMS: To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications in a geographically defined population in London, UK., METHOD: Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and SLAM service use., RESULTS: Of 6309 participants, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted hazard ratio HR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.73-3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted HR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.72)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - In this study, we aimed to present a geriatric patient with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and with contradictory results in rRT-PCR examinations in short time intervals. A 69-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room on the 18th day of May 2020, with the complaints of fever, sweating, myalgia, dry cough that continued for 5 days, and the lack of taste that started on the day he applied to the emergency room. Comorbidity factors include diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, and hypertension. The patient has a history of 36 years of smoking 1.5 packs per day. High laboratory findings during hospitalization: monocytes, creatinine, CRP (C-reactive protein). In the thorax CT, in the parenchyma areas of both lungs, there are increases in attenuation with multilobe distributions (more visible at the level of the upper lobes) in the form of ground-glass opacities. May 19, 2020, was subjected to the rRT-PCR test, repeated twice on the 19th of May which also resulted in positive. Despite rRT-PCR tests, which were negative on 27th of May and positive on 28th of May, the patient, whose symptoms disappeared, and general condition improved, was discharged on June 1, 2020, with the recommendation for home isolation. In our case, unlike the incubation period only, we encountered a negative rRT-PCR result on the 8th day after diagnosis. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic control and filiation evaluation with the rRT-PCR test may produce false negative results. Copyright © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, and is characterized by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Great efforts are currently being made to block the signal transduction pathway of pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to control this "cytokine storm" and rescue severely affected patients. Consequently, possible treatments for cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation, preferably within approved safe therapies, are urgently being researched to reduce rising mortality. One approach to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine release is to activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAchR). Nicotine, an exogenous alpha7nAchR agonist, is clinically used in ulcerative colitis to counteract inflammation. We have found epidemiological evidence, based on recent clinical SARS-CoV-2 studies in China, that suggest that smokers are statistically less likely to be hospitalized. In conclusion, our hypothesis proposes that nicotine could constitute a novel potential CRS therapy in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It produces severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, characterised by the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to the World Health Organization, those who smoke are likely to be more vulnerable to infection. Here, in order to clarify the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and COVID-19, we present a systematic literature review until 28th April 2020 and a meta-analysis. We included 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies based on smoking patient status from 720 initial studies in China, the USA, and Italy. The percentage of hospitalised current smokers was 7.7% (95% CI: 6.9-8.4) in China, 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-2.9) in the USA and 7.6% (95% CI: 4.2-11.0) in Italy. These percentages were compared to the smoking prevalence of each country and statistically significant differences were found in them all (p < 0.0001). By means of the meta-analysis, we offer epidemiological evidence showing that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalised (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14-0.23, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the analysis of data from 18 studies shows a much lower percentage of hospitalised current smokers than expected. As more studies become available, this trend should be checked to obtain conclusive results and to explore, where appropriate, the underlying mechanism of the severe progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for thousands of deaths and hospitalizations. To curb the spread of this highly transmissible disease, governments enacted protective guidelines for its citizens, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. These restrictions on social interactions can be especially problematic for individuals managing or recovering from addiction given that treatment often involves access to services and resources that became limited or even unavailable at this time. Social media sites like Twitter serve as a space for users to post questions and concerns about timely topics and allow for researchers to track common themes among the public. The goal of this study was to identify how the public was discussing addiction on Twitter during the COVID pandemic. Methods: We performed a text mining analysis to analyze tweets that contained "addiction" and "covid" to capture posts from the public that illustrated comments and concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on 3,301 tweets captured between January 31 and April 23, 2020. The study was conducted in the United States, but contained tweets from multiple countries. Results: The most prevalent topics had to do with services offered by Acadia Healthcare and Serenity Healthcare Centers, attempts to manage time while home, difficulties of coping with alcoholism amidst rising sales of alcohol, and attention to ongoing health crises (e.g.,., opioids, vaping). Additional topics included affordable telehealth services, research from France on the relationship between nicotine and COVID-19, concerns about gambling addiction, and changing patterns in substance misuse as drug availability varies. Conclusions: Analyzing Twitter content enables health professionals to identify the public's concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from text mining studies addressing timely health topics can serve as preliminary analyses for building more comprehensive models, which can then be used to generate recommendations for the larger public and inform policy.

N2  - AIMS: In Danish patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases to explore self-protection strategies and health behaviour including adherence to disease-modifying antirheumatic treatment (DMARD) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and again after the reopening of the society started. Furthermore, to identify characteristics of patients with high levels of anxiety and self-isolation., METHODS: Patients in routine care followed prospectively in the nationwide DANBIO registry were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding disease activity and COVID-19 infection, behaviour in March and June 2020. Responses were linked to patient data in DANBIO. Characteristics potentially associated with anxiety, self-isolation and medication adherence (gender/age/diagnosis/education/work status/comorbidity/DMARD/smoking/EQ-5D/disease activity) were explored with multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: We included 12 789 patients (8168 rheumatoid arthritis/2068 psoriatic arthritis/1758 axial spondyloarthritis/795 other) of whom 65% were women and 36% treated with biological DMARD. Self-reported COVID-19 prevalence was 0.3%. Patients reported that they were worried to get COVID-19 infection (March/June: 70%/45%) and self-isolated more than others of the same age (48%/38%). The fraction of patients who changed medication due to fear of COVID-19 were 4.1%/0.6%. Female gender, comorbidities, not working, lower education, biological treatment and poor European Quality of life, 5 dimensions were associated with both anxiety and self-isolation., CONCLUSION: In >12 000 patients with inflammatory arthritis, we found widespread anxiety and self-isolation, but high medication adherence, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This persisted during the gradual opening of society during the following months. Attention to patients' anxiety and self-isolation is important during this and potential future epidemics.

T1  - Tripartite Combination of Candidate Pandemic Mitigation Agents: Vitamin D, Quercetin, and Estradiol Manifest Properties of Medicinal Agents for Targeted Mitigation of the COVID-19 Pandemic Defined by Genomics-Guided Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 Targets in Human Cells.
A1  - Glinsky, Gennadi V
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN, were employed as baits to build genomic-guided molecular maps of upstream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in the human body, and pathophysiologically relevant cell types. Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Women are predicted to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased carer responsibilities, loss of income, worry about the virus and a predominantly female healthcare workforce. Whilst there is emerging evidence that negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be more pronounced for women than men, less attention has focussed on changes to health behaviours and health seeking experienced by women. Similarly, the impact of the pandemic in rural areas has not been investigated in detail. Our research questions were 'have females residing in rural areas experienced changes in alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption, smoking, exercise or health seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'are there differences in health behaviour changes between rural females living with or without children?'. Net increases (scale of 0-1) in consumption of unhealthy food (95% CI 0.05, 0.22) and alcohol (95% CI 0.12, 0.29) were observed. Net decreases (scale of -1 to 0) in visits to the doctor (95% CI -0.23, -0.35) and other health professionals (95% CI -0.40, -0.54) were observed. Compared with females living without children, females who lived with children were significantly associated with increased alcohol consumption (OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 4.1), decreased visits to the doctor (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.2) and decreased visits to other health professionals (OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1, 3.3). Results suggest that public health approaches may be required to support females residing in rural areas to optimise their health behaviours during the pandemic, particularly for those living with children. Policies must be gender responsive to counteract worsening health and social inequities both during and after the pandemic.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some populations being confined to their homes as part of infection control measures. This situation can be hard to cope with due to separation from loved ones, prohibition of regular activities, fear of infection, loss of freedom, and so on. These negative impacts cause considerable psychological stress, and all the more so when the situation continues for an extended period, as was the case in Spain. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of COVID-19 quarantine on the emotional functioning of confined Spanish individuals after 8 weeks of lockdown by means of a cross-sectional study. The possible associations between changes in emotional functioning and demographic variables (age and sex), health habits (physical exercise, following a routine, and smoking), social support, and resilience were also analyzed., Methods: A total of 906 Spanish adults completed an online survey to gather information about their prevailing mood and affects (before and after 8 weeks of lockdown), using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), and other variables related to their habits and protective factors., Findings: As expected, the data indicated an increase in negative affects (e.g., "upset," "afraid," "distressed") and a decrease in positive affects after 8 weeks under lockdown, as well as a general decline in overall mood. The largest increases in negative affects were observed in young adults (18-35 years) and women. We did not find any differences between people who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Adhering to a routine, maintaining the same weight, and moderate physical exercise were associated with fewer negative affects, which indicates they are important protective factors, as are perceived social support and resilience., Conclusion: In order to mitigate the psychological impact of confinement, it is important to develop psychoeducational measures that encourage subjects to adhere to health habits and promote social support and resilience as protective factors. A special preventive focus should be placed on the most vulnerable population groups, namely women and young adults. For a public health lockdown to succeed, its negative consequences must be minimized insofar as possible through adequate knowledge of the risk factors and protective factors, and by means of prevention-oriented organization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is insufficient information about risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse outcomes from low and middle-income countries (LMICs)., OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico., METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome., RESULTS: Overall, 236 439 patients were included, with 89 756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome., CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic. Copyright ©ERS 2020.

N2  - Little information is available on the beneficial effects of cholecalciferol treatment in comorbid patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the clinical outcome of patients receiving in-hospital high-dose bolus cholecalciferol. Patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and overt COVID-19, hospitalized from 15 March to 20 April 2020, were considered. Based on clinical characteristics, they were supplemented (or not) with 400,000 IU bolus oral cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and the composite outcome (transfer to intensive care unit; ICU and/or death) was recorded. Ninety-one patients (aged 74 +/- 13 years) with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Fifty (54.9%) patients presented with two or more comorbid diseases. Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 +/- 10 days), 27 (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Racial/ethnic minorities experience more severe outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the general US population. This study was undertaken to examine the association between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 hospitalization, ventilation status, and mortality in people with rheumatic disease., METHODS: US patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 were entered into the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry between March 24, 2020 and August 26, 2020 were included. Race/ethnicity was defined as White, African American, Latinx, Asian, or other/mixed race. Outcome measures included hospitalization, requirement for ventilatory support, and death. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, medication use prior to infection, and rheumatic disease activity., RESULTS: A total of 1,324 patients were included, of whom 36% were hospitalized and 6% died; 26% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable models, African American patients (OR 2.74 [95% CI 1.90-3.95]), Latinx patients (OR 1.71 [95% CI 1.18-2.49]), and Asian patients (OR 2.69 [95% CI 1.16-6.24]) had higher odds of hospitalization compared to White patients. Latinx patients also had 3-fold increased odds of requiring ventilatory support (OR 3.25 [95% CI 1.75-6.05]). No differences in mortality based on race/ethnicity were found, though power to detect associations may have been limited., CONCLUSION: Similar to findings in the general US population, racial/ethnic minorities with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 had increased odds of hospitalization and ventilatory support. These results illustrate significant health disparities related to COVID-19 in people with rheumatic diseases. The rheumatology community should proactively address the needs of patients currently experiencing inequitable health outcomes during the pandemic. Copyright © 2020, American College of Rheumatology.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood. The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease., METHODS: Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed., RESULTS: A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose >=10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed., CONCLUSIONS: We found that glucocorticoid exposure of >=10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease. Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

N2  - Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from China in 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Patients with metabolic comorbid conditions are more susceptible to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interlinked metabolic risk factors that predispose patients to increased risk of complications. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of NAFLD., Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between metabolic syndrome components and the risk of COVID-19., Methods: We reviewed data from a large commercial database (Explorys IBM) that aggregates electronic health records from 26 large nationwide healthcare systems. Using systemized nomenclature of clinical medical terms (SNOMED-CT), we identified adults with the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and its individual components from 1999 to 2019. We included patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from December 2019 to May 2020. Comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, male gender, African American, and hypertension were collected. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate whether metabolic syndrome or its individual components are independently associated with the risk of COVID-19., Results: Out of 61.4 million active adult patients in the database, 8885 (0.01%) had documented COVID-19. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher if metabolic syndrome was the primary diagnosis (0.10% vs 0.01%, OR 7.00 [6.11-8.01]). The adjusted odds (aOR) of having COVID-19 was higher in patients if they were African Americans (aOR 7.45 [7.14-7.77]), hypertensive (aOR 2.53 [2.40-2.68]), obese (aOR 2.20 [2.10-2.32]), diabetic (aOR 1.41 [1.33-1.48]), hyperlipidemic (aOR 1.70 [1.56-1.74]), or diagnosed with NASH (aOR 4.93 [4.06-6.00]). There was a slight decrease in the adjusted odds of having COVID-19 in males as compared to females (aOR 0.88 [0.84-0.92])., Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic syndrome is high. Among all comorbid metabolic conditions, NASH had the strongest association with COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters., Methods: We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors., Results: During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with >20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98)., Conclusions: We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global crisis, necessitating the identification of genetic factors that modulate the risk of disorder or its severity. The current data about the role of genetic risk factors in determination of rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in each ethnic group and the severity of disorder is limited. Moreover, several confounding parameters such as the number of tests performed in each country, the structure of the population especially the age distribution, the presence of risk factors for respiratory disorders such as smoking and other environmental factors might be involved in the variability in disease course or prevalence of infection among different ethnic groups. However, assessment of the role of genetic variants in determination of the course of other respiratory infections might help in recognition of possible candidate for further analysis in patients affected with SARS-CoV-2. In the current review, we summarize the data showing the association between genomic variants and risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory infections or severity of these conditions with an especial focus on the SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: New Zealand's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most restrictive lockdowns of any country, inevitably causing stress for many people. Because situations that increase stress and anxiety are associated with higher smoking prevalence, we examined self-reported smoking before and during the lockdown, and analyzed factors associated with reported changes in cigarette consumption., AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown; the final, weighted sample included 261 daily smokers and 71 weekly smokers. We measured psychological distress and anxiety, as well as situational factors, tobacco consumption, and demographic attributes., RESULTS: Nearly half of daily smokers reported smoking more during than before the lockdown, on average, an increase of six cigarettes a day; increased daily cigarette consumption was associated with loneliness and isolation. Most weekly smokers reported either that their smoking during the lockdown had not changed or had slightly reduced., CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation services need to anticipate that unexpected disruptions, such as pandemic lockdowns, may be associated with increased daily tobacco consumption, and that this increase may be sustained after lockdown. While public health responses to pandemics predictably focus on immediate and obvious consequences, interventions to support recent quitters and those making quit attempts should also form a key component of pandemic planning., IMPLICATIONS: As governments introduce unprecedented measures to manage COVID-19, they need also to consider other public health risks, such as increased smoking among current smokers or relapse among recent quitters. Evidence that loneliness was associated with increased smoking during a lockdown suggests a need for cessation out-reach strategies that promote and support smoke-free practices.

N2  - It is an ugly fact that a significant amount of the world's population will contract SARS-CoV-II infection with the current spreading. While a specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death. The careful individual assessment for the possible dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Early reports on patients with cancer and COVID-19 have suggested a high mortality rate compared with the general population. Patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary comorbidities, in addition to cancer treatments. We aimed to study the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on patients with thoracic malignancies., METHODS: The Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT) registry is a multicentre observational study composed of a cross-sectional component and a longitudinal cohort component. Eligibility criteria were the presence of any thoracic cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small-cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumours, and other pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms) and a COVID-19 diagnosis, either laboratory confirmed with RT-PCR, suspected with symptoms and contacts, or radiologically suspected cases with lung imaging features consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and symptoms. Patients of any age, sex, histology, or stage were considered eligible, including those in active treatment and clinical follow-up. Clinical data were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients from Jan 1, 2020, and will be collected until the end of pandemic declared by WHO. Data on demographics, oncological history and comorbidities, COVID-19 diagnosis, and course of illness and clinical outcomes were collected. Associations between demographic or clinical characteristics and outcomes were measured with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, with sex, age, smoking status, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease included in multivariable analysis. This is a preliminary analysis of the first 200 patients. The registry continues to accept new sites and patient data., FINDINGS: Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients with COVID-19 and thoracic cancers from eight countries were identified and included in the TERAVOLT registry; median age was 68.0 years (61.8-75.0) and the majority had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (142 [72%] of 196 patients), were current or former smokers (159 [81%] of 196), had non-small-cell lung cancer (151 [76%] of 200), and were on therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (147 [74%] of 199), with 112 (57%) of 197 on first-line treatment. 152 (76%) patients were hospitalised and 66 (33%) died. 13 (10%) of 134 patients who met criteria for ICU admission were admitted to ICU; the remaining 121 were hospitalised, but were not admitted to ICU. Univariable analyses revealed that being older than 65 years (OR 1.88, 95% 1.00-3.62), being a current or former smoker (4.24, 1.70-12.95), receiving treatment with chemotherapy alone (2.54, 1.09-6.11), and the presence of any comorbidities (2.65, 1.09-7.46) were associated with increased risk of death. However, in multivariable analysis, only smoking history (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.11-9.06) was associated with increased risk of death., INTERPRETATION: With an ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, our data suggest high mortality and low admission to intensive care in patients with thoracic cancer. Whether mortality could be reduced with treatment in intensive care remains to be determined. With improved cancer therapeutic options, access to intensive care should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting based on cancer specific mortality and patients' preference., FUNDING: None.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and could develop more severe symptoms if they contract the disease owing to their impaired immune responses to viral infections. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been widely used by individuals worldwide to express their responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal changes in the attitudes of Twitter users who used e-cigarettes toward the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compare differences in attitudes between e-cigarette users and nonusers based on Twitter data., METHODS: The study dataset containing COVID-19-related Twitter posts (tweets) posted between March 5 and April 3, 2020, was collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface with COVID-19-related keywords. Twitter users were classified into two groups: Ecig group, including users who did not have commercial accounts but posted e-cigarette-related tweets between May 2019 and August 2019, and non-Ecig group, including users who did not post any e-cigarette-related tweets. Sentiment analysis was performed to compare sentiment scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic between both groups and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling was performed to compare the main topics discussed between the groups., RESULTS: The US COVID-19 dataset consisted of 4,500,248 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 187,399 unique Twitter users in the Ecig group and 11,479,773 COVID-19-related tweets collected from 2,511,659 unique Twitter users in the non-Ecig group. Sentiment analysis showed that Ecig group users had more negative sentiment scores than non-Ecig group users. Results from topic modeling indicated that Ecig group users had more concerns about deaths due to COVID-19, whereas non-Ecig group users cared more about the government's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that Twitter users who tweeted about e-cigarettes had more concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform public health practitioners to use social media platforms such as Twitter for timely monitoring of public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and educating and encouraging current e-cigarette users to quit vaping to minimize the risks associated with COVID-19.

To better understand public health and addiction, this study investigated to what extent work-time and leisure-time internet use relate to problematic internet use and perceived quality of life among college students and highly educated adults. An online cross-sectional survey with 446 individuals was assessed in Germany. Linear regression analyses were used to predict problematic internet use. Ordinal regression analyses were applied to predict perceived quality of life. Results showed that leisure-time internet use, but not work-time internet use, was positively associated with problematic internet use. Participants whose work-time internet use could be considered balanced (5-28 h/week in this study) indicated a higher perceived quality of life compared to individuals with little or large amount of internet use for work. The findings still emerged when taking negative feelings, perceived stress, smoking status and alcohol consumption into account. As both work-time and leisure-time internet use can be risk factors for mental health in terms of problematic internet use and perceived quality of life, well-controlled internet use rather than excessive use is recommended. This should be kept in mind when dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath.

N2  - Several cases have recently been reported concerning the development of a syndrome of acute lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarettes, leading to respiratory failure and several deaths. We present a case of a young veteran who presented with e-cigarette vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) to a primary care clinic and who required subsequent inpatient admission and home oxygen therapy after discharge. The patient afterwards improved after a three-month course of steroids and cessation of THC-containing electronic cigarettes, consistent with previously reported cases. Furthermore, evidence on bronchoscopy and biopsy demonstrated intracellular lipid droplets in the patient's macrophages. This outpatient case of EVALI prompts primary care providers to raise suspicion of this condition, and enquire about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, similar clinical and radiographic presentations between COVID-19 and EVALI can be seen. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2. This infection can cause mild to very severe respiratory and systemic illness mainly related with a cytokine storm. The epidemiology of COVID-19 is under continuous evolution, and studies are ongoing aiming at identifying the possible factors facilitating the diffusion of this infection. It is documented that air pollution and smoking are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality globally, and can increase the risk of many diseases, including respiratory diseases. Overall, a linear relationship between exposure to atmospheric pollutants and diffusion of the Sars-Cov2 virus seems to exist. However, this correlation, cannot be regarded as a cause-effect relationship. The available data show that air pollution is responsible for inflammation and hyper-activation of innate immunity that are associated with the worst outcomes of covid-19 but do not allow to conclude that atmospheric particulate is responsible for increased contagion. As to smoking, nicotine activation of nicotinic receptors leads to enhanced protease activation, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling through the same pathways (Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) used by the virus increasing the inflammatory/destructive action of the virus itself. The increase in non-communicable diseases and of chronic inflammatory diseases is in line with environmental pollution, related climate changes, and with an augmented susceptibility to infectious diseases with increased contagiousness and morbidity. Restrictive measures to limit environmental pollution are needed worldwide as this represents a threat for human health.

N2  - Background: On February 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic began in Italy. In order to contain the spread of the virus, the Italian government adopted emergency measures nationwide, including closure of schools and universities, workplaces and subsequently lockdown. This survey was carried out among Italian undergraduates to explore their level of knowledge about the epidemic and the behaviors they adopted during the lockdown. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was administered to the students attending three Italian universities. Results: A good level of knowledge about the epidemic and its control was registered in the sample, mainly among students attending life sciences degree courses. The majority of the students did not modify their diet and smoking habits, while a great part of the sample reported a decrease in physical activity (PA). Conclusions: Students from life sciences courses showed a higher awareness regarding the infection and the control measures. The lockdown caused an important reduction of PA. Preventive interventions should transform the restrictive measures also as an opportunity to improve lifestyle.

N2  - Importance: Understanding patterns of e-cigarette use and access during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is important because e-cigarettes may put users at risk for more severe respiratory effects and other health problems., Objective: To examine whether underage youth and young adults who ever used e-cigarettes self-reported changes in access and use of e-cigarettes since the COVID-19 pandemic began., Design, Setting, and Participants: A national, cross-sectional online survey study was conducted from May 6 to May 14, 2020. This sample of 4351 participants aged 13 to 24 years across the US included 2167 e-cigarette ever-users. Quota sampling was used to balance for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 50% having ever used e-cigarettes., Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in e-cigarette use (increase, decrease, quit, no change, and switch to another product) and access to e-cigarettes (easier or harder, and change in point-of-purchase) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic began, reasons for change, number of times e-cigarettes were used, nicotine dependence, and sociodemographic data., Results: This study focused on 2167 e-cigarette ever-users among 4351 participants who completed the survey. Among 2167 e-cigarette users, a total of 1442 were younger than 21 years and 725 were aged 21 years or older; 1397 were female (64.5%) and 438 identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (20.2%). The survey completion rate was 40%. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, 1198 of 2125 e-cigarette users (56.4%) changed their use: 388 individuals (32.4%) quit, 422 individuals (35.3%) reduced the amount of nicotine, 211 individuals (17.6%) increased nicotine use, 94 individuals (7.8%) increased cannabis use, and 82 individuals (6.9%) switched to other products. Participants reported that not being able to go to vape shops and product unavailability were the reasons accessing e-cigarettes was difficult after the pandemic began. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, individuals reported purchasing from alternative retail stores (disposables, 150 of 632 [23.7%]; pod-based, 144 of 797 [18.1%]; and other e-cigarette, 125 of 560 [22.3%], ie, between 18.1% and 23.7%), purchasing online instead of retail (disposables, 115 of 632 [18.2%]; pod-based, 156 of 797 [19.6%]; and other e-cigarette, 111 of 560 [19.8%], ie, between 18.2% to 19.8%), and shifted to retail instead of online (disposables, 11 of 632 [1.7%]; pod-based, 17 of 797 [2.0%]; and other e-cigarette, 13 of 560 [2.3%], ie, between 1.7%-2.3%). Other individuals reported no change: from retail stores (disposables 262 of 632 [41.5%]; pod-based 344 of 797 [43.2%]; and other e-cigarette, 223 of 560 [39.8%], ie, between 39.8% and 43.2%) and online (disposables 94 of 632 [14.9%]; pod-based 136 of 797 [17.1%]; and other e-cigarette, 88 of 560 [15.8%], ie, between 14.9% and 17.1%). Underage youth reported e-cigarette deliveries from vape shops and/or dealers or friends who received such deliveries, and 63 of 229 (27.5%) self-reported accessing e-cigarettes without age verification. e-Cigarette users were 52% less likely to quit or reduce their use if they previously used e-cigarettes between 11 and 99 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.78), 68% less likely to quit if they previously used e-cigarettes more than 100 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51), and 51% were less likely to quit if they were nicotine dependent (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.70)., Conclusions and Relevance: During the COVID-19 pandemic, youth e-cigarette users reported changes in e-cigarette use, point-of-purchase, and ability to purchase e-cigarettes without age verification. The US Food and Drug Administration and local policy makers may find these data useful to inform policies to prevent e-cigarette sales to underage youth.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess whether youth cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, and diagnosis., METHODS: An online national survey of adolescents and young adults (n = 4,351) aged 13-24 years was conducted in May 2020. Multivariable logistic regression assessed relationships among COVID-19-related symptoms, testing, and diagnosis and cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only and dual use, sociodemographic factors, obesity, and complying with shelter-in-place., RESULTS: COVID-19 diagnosis was five times more likely among ever-users of e-cigarettes only (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-13.96), seven times more likely among ever-dual-users (95% CI: 1.98-24.55), and 6.8 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 2.40-19.55). Testing was nine times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 5.43-15.47) and 2.6 times more likely among past 30-day e-cigarette only users (95% CI: 1.33-4.87). Symptoms were 4.7 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 3.07-7.16)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with youth use of e-cigarettes only and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes, suggesting the need for screening and education.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review new pediatric lung disorders-including disorders that have occurred in recent years years such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine-origin influenza A (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia-to enhance understanding of the characteristic imaging findings. CONCLUSION. Although the clinical symptoms of SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and COVID-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients may be nonspecific, some characteristic imaging findings have emerged or are currently emerging. It is essential for radiologists to have a clear understanding of the characteristic imaging appearances of these lung disorders in pediatric patients to ensure optimal patient care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., AIMS: We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 SCZ patients with those of non-SCZ patients., METHOD: This was a case-control study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 AP-HM/AMU acute care hospitals in Marseille, southern France. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample and/or on chest computed scan among patients requiring hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission., RESULTS: A total of 1092 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9.0%. The SCZ patients had an increased mortality compared to the non-SCZ patients (26.7% vs. 8.7%, P=0.039), which was confirmed by the multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, obesity and comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio 4.36 [95% CI: 1.09-17.44]; P=0.038). In contrast, the SCZ patients were not more frequently admitted to the ICU than the non-SCZ patients. Importantly, the SCZ patients were mostly institutionalized (63.6%, 100% of those who died), and they were more likely to have cancers and respiratory comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SCZ is not overrepresented among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, but SCZ is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality, confirming the existence of health disparities described in other somatic diseases.

N2  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a high-mortality global pandemic. The clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is desirable for management, and prioritization for trial enrollment. We developed a prediction rule for COVID-19 mortality in a population-based cohort in Ontario, Canada., Methods: Data from Ontario's provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Logistic regression-based prediction rules and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model were developed and validated using split-halves validation. Sensitivity analyses were performed, with varying approaches to missing data., Results: Of 21 922 COVID-19 cases, 1734 with complete data were included in the derivation set; 1796 were included in the validation set. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease, and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded, long-term care excluded, and Cox model-based). All displayed excellent discrimination (area under the curve for all rules > 0.92) and calibration (P > .50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All performed well in the validation set and were robust to varying approaches to replacement of missing variables., Conclusions: We used a public health case management data system to build and validate 4 accurate, well-calibrated, robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be useful tools for management, risk stratification, and clinical trials. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

T1  - The temporary ban on tobacco sales in South Africa: lessons for endgame strategies.
A1  - Filby, Samantha

A1  - van Walbeek, Corne
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The endgame literature recommends that, for a tobacco sales ban to be successful, several demand-side preconditions (eg, low prevalence and effective cessation support) should be in place. The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown., OBJECTIVES: To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning., METHODS: Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban., RESULTS: About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels., CONCLUSIONS: The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Identification of reliable outcome predictors in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of paramount importance for improving patient's management., METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted until 24 April 2020. From 6843 articles, 49 studies were selected for a pooled assessment; cumulative statistics for age and sex were retrieved in 587 790 and 602 234 cases. Two endpoints were defined: (a) a composite outcome including death, severe presentation, hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation; and (b) in-hospital mortality. We extracted numeric data on patients' characteristics and cases with adverse outcomes and employed inverse variance random-effects models to derive pooled estimates., RESULTS: We identified 18 and 12 factors associated with the composite endpoint and death, respectively. Among those, a history of CVD (odds ratio (OR) = 3.15, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 2.26-4.41), acute cardiac (OR = 10.58, 5.00-22.40) or kidney (OR = 5.13, 1.78-14.83) injury, increased procalcitonin (OR = 4.8, 2.034-11.31) or D-dimer (OR = 3.7, 1.74-7.89), and thrombocytopenia (OR = 6.23, 1.031-37.67) conveyed the highest odds for the adverse composite endpoint. Advanced age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, acute cardiac or kidney injury, lymphocytopenia and D-dimer conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death. With respect to the treatment of the acute phase, therapy with steroids was associated with the adverse composite endpoint (OR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.934-6.73), but not with mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, comorbidities, abnormal inflammatory and organ injury circulating biomarkers captured patients with an adverse clinical outcome. Clinical history and laboratory profile may then help identify patients with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

N2  - AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the changes in smoking addiction levels during the on-going Covid-19 pandemic., METHODS: This study included 104 participants, >=18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio-demographic information and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data., RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre-pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively., CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid-19 in smokers. Health institutions should therefore take advantage of this period and focus more efforts on the cessation of smoking and other substance abuse issues. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of global concern. Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclinicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population., RESULTS: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84%) had solid tumors and 31 (16%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age >= 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P < .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease., CONCLUSION: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population. Fragile patients and smokers are entitled to active preventive measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close monitoring in the case of exposure or COVID-19-related symptoms.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: to study the impact of social isolation, related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, on lifestyles in Italy, with particular reference to physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits. Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics., DESIGN: epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods., RESULTS: the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones., CONCLUSIONS: the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and effects of current smoking on adverse outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients., Methods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) relevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating prevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current and former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was performed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis., Results: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8-9.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16-0.25, p < 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19-0.30, p < 0.001). Current smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06-2.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27-0.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added (n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19-0.38, p < 0.001) and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24-0.48, p < 0.001)., Conclusion: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be considered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may have a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and by the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored in laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations., METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations., RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94)., CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.

N2  - The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.

N2  - While SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cell entry, it is important to examine other potential interactions between the virus and other cell receptors. Based on the clinical observation of low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we examined and identified a "toxin-like" amino acid (aa) sequence in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 375-390), which is homologous to a sequence of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1, one of the many snake venom toxins that are known to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We present the 3D structural location of this "toxin-like" sequence on the Spike Glycoprotein and the superposition of the modelled structure of the Neurotoxin homolog NL1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. We also performed computational molecular modelling and docking experiments using 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the extracellular domain of the nAChR alpha9 subunit. We identified a main interaction between the aa 381-386 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the aa 189-192 of the extracellular domain of the nAChR alpha9 subunit, a region which forms the core of the "toxin-binding site" of the nAChRs. The mode of interaction is very similar to the interaction between the alpha9 nAChR and alpha-bungarotoxin. A similar interaction was observed between the pentameric alpha7 AChR chimera and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. The findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with nAChRs, supporting the hypothesis of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system being implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Nicotine and other nicotinic cholinergic agonists may protect nAChRs and thus have therapeutic value in COVID-19 patients.

Revealing the health effects associated with smoking has been in the focus of intense research for decades. Due to these research efforts, there is a convincing evidence regarding the negative effects of conventional cigarettes. However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored. The lack of pertinent information regarding the late effects of e-cigarette and hookah does not imply that there is no health risk associated with their consumption. On the contrary, in addition to the regular antismoke measures, pulmonologists and policy makers should do everything to lower the consumption of these alternative products.

N2  - Cigarette smoking has negative health implications for surgical patients. Smoking cessation before surgery reduces complications; however, information on the risks of smoking and benefits of quitting on surgical outcomes are not regularly provided to patients. It is especially important for smokers to quit now because they are at increased risk of serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a program for smoking cessation in a preanesthesia clinic associated with a southwestern medical center to increase motivation to quit smoking. The evidence-based program involved development of a provider toolkit, a referral process, provider education, and program evaluation. After provider education, the program commenced. Of the 134 current smokers encountered over a 16-week period, most were ready to quit within 30 days (n = 92, 68.66%). Of the smokers who were ready to quit, 50 (37.31%) accepted referral for smoking cessation counseling, treatment, or both. Only 13 (9.70%) of the 134 smokers were already receiving treatment. This program enabled providers to feel more comfortable discussing the implications of smoking, advising smokers to quit, providing education materials, and offering referral services at the appropriate stage of readiness for behavior change.

N2  - This study aims to predict death after COVID-19 using only the past medical information routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs) and to understand the differences in risk factors across age groups. Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65-85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality. The ability to compute precise individual-level risk scores exclusively based on the EHR is crucial for effectively allocating and distributing resources, such as prioritizing vaccination among the general population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early reports indicate that COVID-19 may require intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 5-26% and overall mortality can rise to 11% of the recognised cases, particularly affecting the elderly. There is a lack of evidence-based targeted pharmacological therapy for its prevention and treatment. We aim to compare the effects of a World Health Organization recommendation-based education and a personalised complex preventive lifestyle intervention package (based on the same WHO recommendation) on the outcomes of the COVID-19., METHODS: PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomised controlled clinical trial with adaptive "sample size re-estimation" design. Hungarian population over the age of 60 years without confirmed COVID-19 will be approached to participate in a telephone health assessment and lifestyle counselling voluntarily. Volunteers will be randomised into two groups: (A) general health education and (B) personalised health education. Participants will go through questioning and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health, (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity, (4) dietary habits, and (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. Assessment will be done weekly during the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. The composite primary endpoint will include the rate of ICU admission, hospital admission (longer than 48 h), and mortality in COVID-19-positive cases. The estimated sample size is 3788 subjects per study arm. The planned duration of the follow-up is a minimum of 1 year., DISCUSSION: These interventions may boost the body's cardiovascular and pulmonary reserve capacities, leading to improved resistance against the damage caused by COVID-19. Consequently, lifestyle changes can reduce the incidence of life-threatening conditions and attenuate the detrimental effects of the pandemic seriously affecting the older population., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been approved by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Hungarian Medical Research Council (IV/2428- 2 /2020/EKU) and has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04321928 ) on 25 March 2020.

N2  - COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the whole world by increasing morbidity and mortality rates day by day. Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with COVID-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus pro-inflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen COVID-19 patients at high risk of worsening. Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score = SOFA), MuLBSTA Score (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension, and age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). In our study, the mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from the hospital. According to the results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA, and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors that emphasize the use of anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk, or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors that enhance the use of anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects, or no success to antiviral treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The presence of atopy is considered as a risk factor for severe respiratory symptoms in children. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of atopy on the course of disease in children hospitalised with viral pneumonia., METHODS: Children between the ages of 1 and 6 years hospitalised due to viral pneumonia between the years of 2013 and 2016 were included to this multicentre study. Patients were classified into two groups as mild-moderate and severe according to the course of pneumonia. Presence of atopy was evaluated with skin prick tests. Groups were compared to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe viral pneumonia., RESULTS: A total of 280 patients from nine centres were included in the study. Of these patients, 163 (58.2%) were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), Influenza A (20.5%), rhinovirus (18.9%), adenovirus (10%), human metapneumovirus (8%), parainfluenza (5.2%), coronavirus (6%), and bocavirus (1.6%) were isolated from respiratory samples. Eighty-five (30.4%) children had severe pneumonia. Atopic sensitisation was found in 21.4% of the patients. Ever wheezing (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.4), parental asthma (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.2), other allergic diseases in the family (RR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9) and environmental tobacco smoke (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-3.5) were more common in the severe pneumonia group., CONCLUSIONS: When patients with mild-moderate pneumonia were compared to patients with severe pneumonia, frequency of atopy was not different between the two groups. However, parental asthma, ever wheezing and environmental tobacco smoke exposure are risk factors for severe viral pneumonia in children. Copyright © 2017 SEICAP. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The effects of obesity and smoking in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remain controversial. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept. Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this review is to emphasize the mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction and its impact on the enhanced risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: In the beginning of 2020, an unexpected outbreak due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world. Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19 patients., Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant articles that reported clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis., Results: The data of 76993 patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study. According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%-23.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%-22.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%-12.43%) and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%-9.28%), respectively., Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: A life-threatening respiratory disease, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe since December 2019. Many prognostic factors have already been put forward to predict the risk of death and other outcomes. The current study is evaluating the survival rate between hypertensive and non-hypertensive infected patients., METHODS: Patients who were included in this study were admitted between 20 February to 1 March 2020 in Fars (southwest of Iran) province hospitals. Data were collected from the electronic base registry which contained demographic information, medical symptoms, and signs, underlying diseases, CT scan results, and final outcome., RESULTS: Of all 1239 positive cases, 159 (12.83%) had known with hypertension ant this group was significantly older than non-hypertensive patients (66.1 years Vs 48.95 years, p < .001). According to Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test, it was seen hypertensive patients deteriorated more rapidly than non-hypertensive group (p = .032). Moreover, HIV, cardiovascular, and kidney disease were diagnosed as factors that increase the risk of death in hypertensive patients., CONCLUSION: The current study about the survival rate of COVID-19 patients had shown hypertensive patents are in danger of disease severity, although it may be related to their age. Moreover, the probability of other complications like diabetes, smoking, asthma, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases, and either some other infections such as HIV can make the condition complicated and need more consideration to prevent noxious outcomes.

N2  - Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the worldwide higher educational institutes to adopt distance learning mode. Further, remote electronic exams (E-exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medical Sciences students in Jordan. Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical Sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students' health benefits. This is of particular importance since the current students at Faculties of Medical Sciences are the future health care providers. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Most studies of severe/fatal COVID-19 risk have used routine/hospitalisation data without detailed pre-morbid characterisation. Using the community-based UK Biobank cohort, we investigate risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in comparison with non-COVID-19 mortality. We investigated demographic, social (education, income, housing, employment), lifestyle (smoking, drinking, body mass index), biological (lipids, cystatin C, vitamin D), medical (comorbidities, medications) and environmental (air pollution) data from UK Biobank (N = 473,550) in relation to 459 COVID-19 and 2626 non-COVID-19 deaths to 21 September 2020. We used univariate, multivariable and penalised regression models. Age (OR = 2.76 [2.18-3.49] per S.D. [8.1 years], p = 2.6 x 10-17), male sex (OR = 1.47 [1.26-1.73], p = 1.3 x 10-6) and Black versus White ethnicity (OR = 1.21 [1.12-1.29], p = 3.0 x 10-7) were independently associated with and jointly explanatory of (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.79) increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. In multivariable regression, alongside demographic covariates, being a healthcare worker, current smoker, having cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and oral steroid use at enrolment were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Penalised regression models selected income, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cystatin C, and oral steroid use as jointly contributing to COVID-19 mortality risk; Black ethnicity, hypertension and oral steroid use contributed to COVID-19 but not non-COVID-19 mortality. Age, male sex and Black ethnicity, as well as comorbidities and oral steroid use at enrolment were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 death. Our results suggest that previously reported associations of COVID-19 mortality with body mass index, low vitamin D, air pollutants, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may be explained by the aforementioned factors.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking may increase susceptibility to and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This information may influence smoking cessation related beliefs in smokers., METHODS: Online questionnaires were answered from 26 March to 3 April 2020 in the Netherlands by 340 smokers willing to quit smoking. Beliefs regarding (quitting) smoking and (consequences of) the coronavirus are described and associations with motivation to quit due to the coronavirus are reported., RESULTS: While 67.7% of the smokers indicated that the coronavirus did not influence the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 18.5% smoked less cigarettes and 13.8% smoked more cigarettes per day due to the coronavirus. One-third of the smokers were more motivated to quit smoking due to the coronavirus. Motivation to quit due to the coronavirus was positively associated with beliefs about the coronavirus as a serious threat, being at high risk of catching the coronavirus and developing severe illness, smokers being at higher risk than non-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce complaints, the social environment endorsing quitting, and perceived stress., CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of smokers may be receptive to smoking cessation advice due to COVID-19. Because of the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus (e.g. stay at home as much as possible), personalized digital health interventions may be particularly suitable to reach smokers at home.

T1  - Amid COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges with access to care for COPD patients.
A1  - Elbeddini, Ali
A1  - Tayefehchamani, Yasamin
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammation in the lungs that causes obstruction in the airway, poor airflow, and irreversible loss of lung function. In clinical practice, comprehensive care for COPD patients includes the diagnosis using spirometry, clinical examination and comprehensive pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, dyspnea and lung function impairment and can be mild to very severe. Symptoms are examined using the COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and dyspnea grade are examined using a modified MRC from GOLD guidelines. When mild, the care includes self-management education, smoking cessation, lifestyle modifications, vaccination, and short-acting bronchodilators. Self-management education involves inhaler device training, breathing technique, early recognition of acute exacerbations and writing action plans. As the disease progresses, other care measures are added. These measures include the addition of long-acting inhaler therapies, pulmonary rehabilitation, oral therapies, oxygen and lung transplantation. During the final stages of COPD, patients receive end-of-life care (Bourbeau et al., 2019). 1 The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is spread through respiratory droplets. This infectious disease has led to a pandemic and is affecting the lives of many around the world, including Canadians. During this pandemic, the non-essential health services, including caring for patients with COPD, have been put on hold to reduce the risk of spread. Other implications of this pandemic for COPD patients include the health risk in case of infection. A meta-analysis including studies from January to March 2020 in Wuhan showed that pre-existing COPD worsens the risk of COVID-19 progression and leads to poorer prognostics. The sub-group analysis showed a significantly higher risk of ICU requirements and death in COPD patients who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies suggest strong efforts to mitigate the risk of infection in this population (Zhao et al., May 2020). 2 This makes caring for this population even more critical during the pandemic.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Efforts have been made to contain COVID-19. Human behavior, affected by knowledge and perceptions, may influence the course of disease., METHODOLOGY: A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 422 participants. It consisted of 28 questions in four sections; seven questions about sociodemographic characteristics of participants, 12 questions to estimate level of knowledge about COVID-19, six questions to evaluate attitudes toward disease, and three questions to assess practices to prevent disease transmission., RESULTS: Their overall understanding of COVID-19 was satisfactory. 69% of the participants had satisfactory levels of knowledge, and the main sources of information were social media platforms (79.70%) and television (70.90%). There was a significant difference in knowledge as a function of gender (p = 0.50), occupation (p = 0.012), and smoking (p = 0.041). The participants held optimistic attitudes and adopted appropriate protective measures. Most participants agreed that COVID-19 can cause death (64.7%), poses greater risks to elderly (93.4%) and those with chronic diseases (96.7%), it is mandatory to quarantine infected individuals (98.1%), preventive health measures are important (97.6%), and health authorities will succeed in controlling the pandemic (67.5%). There was a statistically significant association between satisfactory levels of knowledge and the practice of wearing masks and the adoption of protective measures (avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing)., CONCLUSIONS: Residents of Al-Jouf region in Saudi Arabia have satisfactory levels of knowledge, optimistic attitudes, and good practice during the rapid rise period of the pandemic. Awareness campaigns will improve any misbeliefs and risky behaviors. Copyright (c) 2021 Eman A El-Masry, Rehab A Mohamed, Rehab I Ali, Marwa F Al Mulhim, Ahmed E Taha.

N2  - To compare the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scores from frontal chest radiographs (CXRs) for predicting patient outcomes and the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65 +/- 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores. AI algorithm is as robust a predictor of adverse patient outcome (death or need for mechanical ventilation) as subjective RALE scores in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

N2  - Lungs of smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are severely compromised and are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attack. The dangerous combination of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 attachment receptor protein ACE2 along with an increase in endocytic vacuoles will enable viral attachment, entry, and replication. The objective of the study was to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 host attachment receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) along with endocytic vacuoles, early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1), late endosome marker RAB7, cathepsin-L, and lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) as lysosome markers in the airways of smokers and COPD patients. The study design was cross-sectional and involved lung resections from 39 patients in total, which included 19 patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I or GOLD stage II COPD, of which 9 were current smokers with COPD (COPD-CS) and 10 were ex-smokers with COPD (COPD-ES), 10 were normal lung function smokers, and 10 were never-smoking normal controls. Immunostaining for ACE2, EEA1, RAB7, and cathepsin-L was done. A comparative description for ACE2, EEA1, RAB7, and cathepsin-L expression pattern is provided for the patient groups. Furthermore, staining intensity for LAMP-1 lysosomes was measured as the ratio of the LAMP-1-stained areas per total area of epithelium or subepithelium, using Image ProPlus v7.0 software. LAMP-1 expression showed a positive correlation to patient smoking history while in COPD LAMP-1 negatively correlated to lung function. The active presence of ACE2 protein along with endocytic vacuoles such as early/late endosomes and lysosomes in the small airways of smokers and COPD patients provides evidence that these patient groups could be more susceptible to COVID-19.

N2  - PURPOSE: The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing., METHODS: Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, Mage = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect., RESULTS: For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic., CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and currently has detrimental human health, community and economic impacts around the world. In SARS-CoV-2-infected lung, induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines is initially poor. When induction does occur, this may in fact exacerbate infection. These observations suggest that baseline levels of leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may be important for orchestrating an effective early immune response. Hence, we performed "in silico flow cytometry" on 1,927 human lung tissues to deconvolute the levels of seven leukocyte types involved in triggering an acute anti-viral cellular immune response. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated NK cells are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses that include sex, age, race, body mass index and smoking history, and in two independent datasets. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that a subgroup of individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to COVID-19 due to concomitant high preexisting ACE2 expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing insurmountable psychosocial impact on the whole mankind. Marginalized community, particularly those with substance use disorders (SUD), are particularly vulnerable to contract the infection and also likely to suffer from greater psychosocial burden. This article analyses the intricate bi-directional relationship between COVID-19 and addiction., METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar are searched with the following key terms- "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV2", "Pandemic", "Addiction", "Opioid", "Alcohol", "Smoking", "Addiction Psychiatry", "Deaddiction", "Substance use disorders", "Behavioral addiction". Few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and addiction have also been added as per context., RESULTS: People with SUD are at greater risk of worse COVID-19 outcome. There is surge of addictive behaviors (both new and relapse) including behavioral addiction in this period. Withdrawal emergencies and death are also being increasingly reported. Addicted people are especially facing difficulties in accessing the healthcare services which are making them prone to procure drugs by illegal means., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and addiction are the two pandemics which are on the verge of collision causing major public health threat. While every effort must be taken to make the public aware of deleterious effects of SUD on COVID-19 prognosis, the resumption of deaddiction services and easier accessibility of prescription drugs are needs of the hour.

N2  - COVID-19 has a benign outcome in most cases, yet it can also be fatal and no specific treatment is available as of yet. Older age and several medical comorbidities are risk factors for COVID-19 complications. We report on an elderly man with a longstanding history of bipolar affective disorder associated with heavy smoking, alcohol abuse and multiple comorbidities, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrent pulmonary sepsis, who contracted COVID-19 during his inpatient treatment of a manic episode, and who fully recovered from COVID-19 without any need for respiratory support. We discuss how his excessive use of nicotine replacement therapy may have contributed to his emerging unscathed from COVID-19. Nicotine, an alpha7-nACh receptor agonist, may boost the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and hinder the uncontrolled overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is understood to be the main pathway to poor outcomes and death in severe COVID-19.

We report on an elderly man with a longstanding history of bipolar affective disorder associated with heavy smoking, alcohol abuse and multiple comorbidities, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrent pulmonary sepsis, who contracted COVID-19 during his inpatient treatment of a manic episode, and who fully recovered from COVID-19 without any need for respiratory support. We discuss how his excessive use of nicotine replacement therapy may have contributed to his emerging unscathed from COVID-19. Nicotine, an alpha7-nACh receptor agonist, may boost the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and hinder the uncontrolled overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is understood to be the main pathway to poor outcomes and death in severe COVID-19.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Progression of COVID-19 to severe disease and death is insufficiently understood., OBJECTIVE: Summarize the prevalence of risk factors and adverse outcomes and determine their associations in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized., METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for case-series and observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through August 31, 2020. Data were analyzed by fixed-effects meta-analysis using Shore's adjusted confidence intervals to address heterogeneity., RESULTS: Seventy-seven studies comprising 38906 hospitalized patients met inclusion criteria; 21468 from the US-Europe and 9740 from China. Overall prevalence of death [% (95% CI)] from COVID-19 was 20% (18-23%); 23% (19-27%) in the US and Europe and 11% (7-16%) for China. Of those that died, 85% were aged>=60 years, 66% were males, and 66%, 44%, 39%, 37%, and 27% had hypertension, smoking history, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. The case fatality risk [%(95% CI)] were 52% (46-60) for heart disease, 51% (43-59) for COPD, 48% (37-63) for chronic kidney disease (CKD), 39% for chronic liver disease (CLD), 28% (23-36%) for hypertension, and 24% (17-33%) for diabetes. Summary relative risk (sRR) of death were higher for age>=60 years [sRR = 3.6; 95% CI: 3.0-4.4], males [1.3; 1.2-1.4], smoking history [1.3; 1.1-1.6], COPD [1.7; 1.4-2.0], hypertension [1.8; 1.6-2.0], diabetes [1.5; 1.4-1.7], heart disease [2.1; 1.8-2.4], CKD [2.5; 2.1-3.0]. The prevalence of hypertension (55%), diabetes (33%), smoking history (23%) and heart disease (17%) among the COVID-19 hospitalized patients in the US were substantially higher than that of the general US population, suggesting increased susceptibility to infection or disease progression for the individuals with comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Public health screening for COVID-19 can be prioritized based on risk-groups. Appropriately addressing the modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes could reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19; public messaging can be accordingly adapted.

N2  - Data sources It is not made clear in this review the different databases selected or how they conducted their search. The studies used are from 1975-2020Study selection The authors have performed a scoping review using 84 studies ranging from 1975-2020. The majority of these are from before the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak period. This is indicative of the lack of evidence on this topic and exemplifies why a scoping review was carried out rather than a systematic review. The studies that were reviewed were predominately cohort and case studies. With regards to previous treatment outcomes, a few systematic reviews were included, but again, the novel nature of this outbreak means that largely, there are only cohort or case studies available for review.Data extraction and synthesis There are ten authors, with no indication of how many performed the literature review or if a mediator was involved in the final decision making on what papers would be reviewed. Results Excessive consumption of alcohol, history of tobacco use, an ageing population, and comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary issues are substantial risk factors for episodes of unfavourable respiratory outcomes. The risk of these outcomes is increased by some of the toxic effects of treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak has a potentially disproportionate impact on the cohort of head and neck cancer patients, and the respiratory effects this has on these patients may increase morbidity and mortality. It is important to include alcohol and smoking cessation, along with good oral hygiene instruction in the care of these patients.

N2  - AIM: To investigate the effect of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on lifestyle behaviors and mood changes in the Croatian general population., METHODS: During ten days of the COVID-19 lockdown in Croatia, 3027 respondents (70.3% female) from the general population completed an online, self-report questionnaire. Demographic data and data on lifestyle habits and mood changes before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were collected., RESULTS: A total of 95.64% of respondents reported to follow most or all restrictions, with female sex (P<0.001) and higher education level (P<0.001) being associated with higher restriction compliance. Women smoked an increased number of cigarettes (P<0.001). The proportion of respondents of both sexes who did not drink or drank 7 drinks per week or more increased (P<0.001). Women also reported lower frequency (P=0.001) and duration of physical exercise (P<0.001). In total, 30.7% of respondents gained weight, with female sex (OR, 2.726) and higher BMI (OR, 1.116; both P<0.001) being associated with an increased likelihood of gaining weight. Both men and women felt more frequently afraid (P<0.001), discouraged (P<0.001), and sad (P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Public health authorities should promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles in order to reduce long-term negative effects of the lockdown.

N2  - Cigarette smoking, the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has been implicated as a risk factor for severe disease in patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we show that mice with lung epithelial cell-specific loss of function of Miz1, which we identified as a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, spontaneously develop progressive age-related changes resembling COPD. Furthermore, loss of Miz1 up-regulates the expression of Ace2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Concomitant partial loss of NF-kappaB/RelA prevented the development of COPD-like phenotype in Miz1-deficient mice. Miz1 protein levels are reduced in the lungs from patients with COPD, and in the lungs of mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke. Our data suggest that Miz1 down-regulation-induced sustained activation of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation in the lung epithelium is sufficient to induce progressive lung and airway destruction that recapitulates features of COPD, with implications for COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a heavy burden on health care systems and governments. Health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (as measured by the eHealth Literacy Scale [eHEALS]) are recognized as strategic public health elements but they have been underestimated during the pandemic. HL, eHEALS score, practices, lifestyles, and the health status of health care workers (HCWs) play crucial roles in containing the COVID-19 pandemic., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the eHEALS and examine associations of HL and eHEALS scores with adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures, lifestyle changes, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs during lockdown., METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 5209 HCWs from 15 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from April 6 to April 19, 2020. Participants answered questions related to sociodemographics, HL, eHEALS, adherence to IPC procedures, behavior changes in eating, smoking, drinking, and physical activity, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and bivariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to validate the eHEALS and examine associations., RESULTS: The eHEALS had a satisfactory construct validity with 8 items highly loaded on one component, with factor loadings ranked from 0.78 to 0.92 explaining 76.34% of variance; satisfactory criterion validity as correlated with HL (rho=0.42); satisfactory convergent validity with high item-scale correlations (rho=0.80-0.84); and high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=.95). HL and eHEALS scores were significantly higher in men (unstandardized coefficient [B]=1.01, 95% CI 0.57-1.45, P<.001; B=0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.00, P<.001), those with a better ability to pay for medication (B=1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.05, P<.001; B=0.60, 95% CI 0.34-0.86, P<.001), doctors (B=1.29, 95% CI 0.73-1.84, P<.001; B 0.56, 95% CI 0.20-0.93, P=.003), and those with epidemic containment experience (B=1.96, 95% CI 1.56-2.37, P<.001; B=0.64, 95% CI 0.38-0.91, P<.001), as compared to their counterparts, respectively. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures (B=0.13, 95% CI 0.10-0.15, P<.001; B=0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26, P<.001), had a higher likelihood of healthy eating (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, P=.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, P=.002), were more physically active (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03, P<.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05, P<.001), and had a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, P<.001; OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98, P<.001), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The eHEALS is a valid and reliable survey tool. Gender, ability to pay for medication, profession, and epidemic containment experience were independent predictors of HL and eHEALS scores. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures, healthier lifestyles, and a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Efforts to improve HCWs' HL and eHEALS scores can help to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize its consequences.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vascular surgeons in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System have been undertaking only essential cases, such as advanced critical limb ischemia. Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999-2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via chi2-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort., RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1 +/- 10.4 years and 68.2 +/- 10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01)., CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - COVID-19 is a relatively new and rapidly emerging disease. Given current knowledge of the disease process, it is of the utmost importance to gain further insight into its different clinical manifestations. In this report we describe three cases involving Hispanic males with COVID-19 all of whom developed pneumomediastinum during their hospital course. We want to emphasize the importance of this adverse event despite their non-smoking history and the exclusion of positive pressure ventilation. Frequent chest radiographs help with early recognition of this disease process. Early detection of pneumomediastinum is important as this could lead to worse morbidity if left unrecognized despite its usually benign nature. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle., METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged >= 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020., RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18-30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated in future more extensive population studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to stress worldwide, especially in vulnerable people like those suffering from mental illness. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures, and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as a potential predictor of distress severity., METHODS: Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress., RESULTS: In our sample (n=112), 29 subjects (25.9 %) reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 %) and 48 (42.9 %) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (p=0.005) and MDD diagnosis (p=0.001) specifically predicted the severity of psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with COVID-19 related distress., CONCLUSIONS: Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that vitamin D may represent a biological factor mediating the psychological response to stress in individuals with affective disorders and provide further insight into tailoring intervention strategies.

N2  - The world is facing Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing a large number of deaths and burden on intensive care facilities. It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.

N2  - The newly recognised coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused a pandemic with huge ramifications for human interactions around the globe. As expected, research efforts to understand the virus and curtail the disease are moving at a frantic pace alongside the spread of rumours, speculations and falsehoods. In this article, we aim to clarify the current scientific view behind several claims or controversies related to COVID-19. Starting with the origin of the virus, we then discuss the effect of ibuprofen and nicotine on the severity of the disease. We highlight the knowledge on fomites and SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the evidence and explications for a disproportionately stronger impact of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities, including a potential protective role for vitamin D. We further review what is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, including their role in transmission of the disease, and conclude with the science on different mortality rates between different countries and whether this hints at the existence of more pathogenic cohorts of SARS-CoV-2.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To systematically review clinical and biochemical characteristics associated with the severity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (COVID-19)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review of observational studies from PubMed, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases including people affected by COVID-19 and reporting data according to the severity of the disease. Data were combined with odds ratio (OR) and metanalysed. Severe COVID-19 was defined by acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission and death., RESULTS: We included 12 studies with 2794 patients, of whom 596 (21.33%) had severe disease. A slightly higher age was found in severe vs non-severe disease. We found that prevalent cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-7.72), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.10-5.19), prevalent cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-5.10), diabetes (OR: 2.78, 95% CI 2.09-3.72), hypertension (OR: 2.24, 95% CI 1.63-3.08), smoking (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22) and male sex (OR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.49) were associated with severe disease. Furthermore, increased procalcitonin (OR: 8.21, 95% CI 4.48-15.07), increased D-Dimer (OR: 5.67, 95% CI 1.45-22.16) and thrombocytopenia (OR: 3.61, 95% CI 2.62-4.97) predicted severe infection., CONCLUSION: Characteristics associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection may allow an early identification and management of patients with poor outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The older population has been especially affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the incidence, severity, mortality rate, clinical features, and risk factors of symptoms of COVID-19 in home-dwelling older people, and its association with type of residence, cognitive deterioration, and neurodegenerative diseases., METHODS: Data about symptoms of COVID-19 were collected through a telephone survey in the cohort of 913 older volunteers of the Vallecas Project, aged 75-90 years, most of them (902) home-dwelling, in Madrid, Spain. The association of demographic and anthropometric measures, genetic polymorphisms, comorbidities, life habits, type of residence, and frailty surrogates were explored as potential risk factors for the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 in the older population., FINDINGS: Sixty-two cases reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19; 6 of them had died, 4 in their home and 2 in the nursing home. Moderate/severe cases were significantly older and more frequently males. The APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with the presence of symptoms of COVID-19. Higher systolic blood pressure, more intense smoking habit, more alcohol intake, lower consumption of coffee and tea, and cognitive impairment were associated with disease severity., CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in this older cohort of Madrid was 6.8%, with an overall mortality rate of 0.7% (18.2% in those living in a nursing home) and a fatality rate of 9.9%. Our exploratory study indicates that life habits, other clinical conditions and, the epsilon4 variant of the APOE gene are associated with the presence and clinical severity of coronavirus infection.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sounded alarm bells throughout global health systems. As of late May, 2020, over 100,000 COVID-19-related deaths were reported in the United States, which is the highest number of any country. This article describes COVID-19 as the next historical turning point in the physical therapy profession's growth and development. The profession has had over a 100-year tradition of responding to epidemics, including poliomyelitis; 2 world wars and geographical regions experiencing conflicts and natural disasters; and, the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The evidence-based role of noninvasive interventions (nonpharmacological/nonsurgical) that hallmark physical therapist practice has emerged as being highly relevant today in addressing COVID-19 in 2 primary ways. First, despite some unique features, COVID-19 presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome in its severe acute stage. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is very familiar to physical therapists in intensive care units. Body positioning and mobilization, prescribed based on comprehensive assessments/examinations, counter the negative sequelae of recumbency and bedrest; augment gas exchange and reduce airway closure, deconditioning, and critical illness complications; and maximize long-term functional outcomes. Physical therapists have an indisputable role across the contiuum of COVID-19 care. Second, over 90% of individuals who die from COVID-19 have comorbidities, most notably cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical therapists need to redouble their efforts to address NCDs by assessing patients for risk factors and manifestations and institute evidence-based health education (smoking cessation, whole-food plant-based nutrition, weight control, physical activity/exercise), and/or support patients' efforts when these are managed by other professionals. Effective health education is a core competency for addressing risk of death by COVID-19 as well as NCDs. COVID-19 is a wake-up call to the profession, an opportunity to assert its role throughout the COVID-19 care continuum, and augment public health initiatives by reducing the impact of the current pandemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), to be a pandemic. From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on Google R Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted., RESULTS: Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network., METHODS: We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network., FINDINGS: We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18.4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13.3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.27-1.89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18.5%] of 1316 adults aged 40-64 years vs 23 [4.6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5.36, 95% CI 3.28-8.76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15.5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62.1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4.75, 95% CI 2.65-8.51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26.2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5.6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.57-5.90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29.5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7.7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.51-2.71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32.9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14.4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.31-2.78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20.9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13.2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11.4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17.9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.71)., INTERPRETATION: A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.

T1  - A putative role for the tobacco mosaic virus in smokers' resistance to COVID-19.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Reports from various countries suggest that tobacco smoking might protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is lower than in the respective general population. Apart from nicotine or other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, we propose that a single-stranded RNA virus that infects tobacco leaves, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), might be implicated in this effect. TMV, though non-pathogenic, is found in smokers' airways, and stimulates adaptive and innate immunity, with release of specific antibodies and interferons. The latter may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against COVID-19. If confirmed by epidemiological and interventional studies, this might lead to the use of TMV as an immunological adjuvant against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.

N2  - Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 based on the medical history of patients, simplified risk prediction models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.

N2  - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening nature of the infection. The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour. Scientists globally also need to up their game to design more specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counteract the pandemic. In this Viewpoint, we provide a brief outline of the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss some probable ways to design therapeutic strategies to overcome the present global crisis.

N2  - The clinical presentation of children and adolescents infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can range from asymptomatic to mild or moderate manifestations. We present a case series of three adolescents who presented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with symptoms concerning for COVID-19, including fever, abdominal symptoms, cough, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. Their laboratory results showed elevated inflammatory markers that are also commonly seen in COVID-19. The chest imaging studies mimicked COVID-19 with non-specific ground glass opacities and interstitial prominence patterns. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing was negative and further questioning of these adolescents and their parents revealed a history of vaping marijuana-related products leading to the eventual diagnosis of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury. Our patients were successfully treated with corticosteroids. The providers caring for pediatric patients, especially adolescents, should continue to have a high index of suspicion for e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury in patients presenting with unexplained respiratory failure, while ruling out COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The recent emergence and rapid global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is leading to public health crises worldwide. Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking (CS) are two known risk factors in many diseases including respiratory infections., Methods: We performed a multi-center study in the four largest hospitals designated for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. There are totally 1547 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the study, alcohol consumption and CS history were evaluated among these patients. The epidemiology, laboratory findings and outcomes of patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied., Results: Our findings indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of CS tend to have more severe outcomes than non-smoking patients. However, alcohol consumption did not reveal significant effects on neither development of severe illness nor death rates in COVID-19 patients., Conclusion: CS is a risk factor for developing severe illness and increasing mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We believe that our findings will provide a better understanding on the effects of alcohol intake and CS exposure in COVID-19 patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in an increased demand for eHealth services globally. There is emerging evidence for the efficacy for group eHealth interventions that support population-based mental health and wellbeing, but a systematic review is lacking. The primary objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence for eHealth group counseling and coaching programs for adults. A second objective is to assess, within studies selected for our primary objective, the impact of programs that encourage PA on outcomes compared to those that do not., METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that assess the impact of eHealth group counseling or coaching programs on mental health, health behavior, or physical health activity among community-dwelling adults will be included. We will search the following electronic databases (from January 2005 onwards): MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINHAL, and the Central Register of Controlled Trials. The primary outcomes will be changes in mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life), behavioral health conditions (e.g., substance use, smoking, sexual behavior, eating behavior, medication adherence), and physical health conditions (e.g., coping with cancer, menopausal symptoms, arthritis pain). Secondary outcomes will be changes in physical activity. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted. The strength of the body of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. The risk of bias in individual studies will be appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Potential sources of gender bias in included studies will be considered at all stages of the planned review., DISCUSSION: This review will contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the effectiveness of eHealth counseling and coaching programs delivered to adults in a group format., SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The protocol has been registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42020187551 ).

N2  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient's blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly became a worldwide healthcare emergency affecting millions of people, with poor outcomes for patients with chronic conditions and enormous pressure on healthcare systems. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) has been cited as a risk factor for a more severe evolution of COVID-19, primarily because its acute exacerbations are already associated with high mortality. We reviewed the available literature on biochemical, pathophysiological, and pharmacological mechanisms of PF and COVID-19 in an attempt to foresee the particular risk of infection and possible evolution of PF patients if infected with SARS-COV-2. We also analyzed the possible role of medication and risk factors (such as smoking) in the disease's evolution and clinical course. We found out that there is a complexity of interactions between coexisting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) and COVID-19 disease. Also, patients recovering from severe COVID-19 disease are at serious risk of developing PF. Smokers seem to have, in theory, a chance for a better outcome if they develop a severe form of COVID-19 but statistically are at much higher risk of dying if they become critically ill.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related lockdown on adherence to lifestyle and drug regimens in stay-at-home chronic coronary syndromes patients living in urban and rural areas., METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was perfomed in patients with chronic coronary syndromes. A sample of 205 patients was randomly drawn from the RICO (Observatoire des infarctus de Cote d'Or) cohort. Eight trained interviewers collected data by phone interview during week 16 (April 13 to April 19), i.e. 4 weeks after implementation of the French lockdown (start March 17, 2020)., RESULTS: Among the 195 patients interviewed (of the 205, 3 had died, 1 declined, 6 lost), mean age was 65.5 +/- 11.1 years. Only six patients (3%) reported drug discontinuation, mainly driven by media influence or family members. All 166 (85%) patients taking aspirin continued their prescribed daily intake. Lifestyle rules were less respected since almost half (45%) declared >25% reduction in physical activity, 26% of smokers increased their tobacco consumption by >25%, and 24% of patients increased their body weight > 2 kg. The decrease in physical activity and the increase in smoking were significantly greater in urban patients (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related lockdown had a negative impact on lifestyle in a representative sample of stay-at-home CCS patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore how patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRDs) coped with their disease during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify possible predictive factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population., METHODS: Patients followed in a single rheumatology department in France or registered on the Spondy+ platform, a secure e-health platform for spondyloarthritis patients, were invited to complete a questionnaire focused on their experiences around COVID19 symptoms, testing and medications access during the lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to report questionnaire's results. Factors associated with COVID-19 or with treatment discontinuation were assessed by logistic regression., RESULTS: We obtained 655 answers from the 2,081 contacted patients: 474 with spondyloarthritis, 129 with rheumatoid arthritis and 52 with psoriatic arthritis. The population was predominantly female (61.8%) with a mean age of 51.0+/-13.4 years. Incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% (95%CI: 5.1-9.2%), including 12 confirmed and 33 highly suspicious cases. No death was observed and five patients needed to be hospitalized. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of infection were SARS-CoV-2 exposure, younger age and non-smoking. More than 30% of the patients suspended or decreased the dosage of one of their drugs during the lockdown period. This was followed in 63.4% of them by increased disease activity. Modifications were mostly motivated by fear of contagion (79.3%)., CONCLUSION: We did not observe any increase of incidence or severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering of the 3 most common CIRDs. This survey also adds evidence of the safety of anti-rheumatic drugs use regarding COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Societe francaise de rhumatologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - Changing health in China: re-evaluating the epidemiological transition model.
A1  - Cook, Ian G
A1  - Dummer, Trevor J B
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This paper reviews the changing health situation in China, which has shown remarkable improvement in the 50 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. At first sight this improving health situation follows the classical epidemiological transition model. Just three decades ago health in China was characterised by high rates of infectious disease and early mortality (diseases of poverty) in a mainly peasant society. More recently infectious disease rates have decreased, with corresponding and extended morbidity and mortality associated with an aging population in a rapidly urbanising society. This process has given rise to new health problems, including chronic and degenerative diseases (diseases of affluence). Nonetheless, while there is some validity in the application of the epidemiological transition concept, further analysis demonstrates that China faces a new epidemiological phase, characterised by increasing life expectancy and diseases of affluence coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that China's state policy plays a major role in defining the parameters of health in a Chinese context. We conclude that, today, China is faced with a new set of health issues, including the impact of smoking, hypertension, the health effects of environmental pollution and the rise of HIV/AIDS; however, state policy remains vital to the health of China's vast population. The challenge for policy is to maintain health reform whilst tackling the problems associated with rapid urbanisation, widening social and spatial inequalities and the emergence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.

N2  - Background: The aims of the present study were to assess changes in lifestyles in the general population in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and the influence of COVID-19 perceptions, as assessed by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), on these changes., Methods: Data were collected from 4005 individuals through an online survey conducted 3-4 weeks after the nationwide lockdown implementation in France. Participants were asked whether they practiced five behaviors (i.e., screen watching, snacking, eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, and walking) less often, as often as, or more often than prior to the lockdown. Beliefs and expectations toward the COVID-19 epidemic were also assessed using an adapted version of Witte's EPPM, together with sociodemographic and environmental variables. Among the respondents consuming regularly alcohol and tobacco, logistic regressions were performed to estimate the Odds ratios (ORs) of increase (yes/no) and decrease (yes/no) in drinking and smoking since the lockdown., Results: More than 8 in 10 respondents reported unhealthy changes in lifestyle since the lockdown, mostly in relation to physical activity. The unhealthy changes were positively associated with male sex (RR = 1.17; confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.10-1.24), living urban density, having a garden (RR = 1.16 [1.07-1.26]), financial difficulties because of COVID-19 (RR = 1.09 [1.02-1.18]), and lack of fear control (RR = 1.04 [1.01-1.09]) and negatively with cognitive avoidance (RR = 0.92 [0.89-0.95]). Less than 4 in 10 respondents reported healthy changes over the same period, mostly in relation to better eating habits. They were positively associated with living with more than two persons (RR = 1.22 [1.02-1.45]), having a terrace (RR = 1.14 [1.02-1.29], and perceived efficacy (RR = 1.11 [1.04-1.08]) and negatively with being aged 40 or higher. Alcohol consumption overall declined in regular drinkers, while a slight increase in tobacco use was observed in regular smokers., Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown resulted in frequent and mostly unhealthy changes in lifestyle among the general population. These changes were related to individual and environmental characteristics but also to EPPM appraisals in the wake of fear appeal from COVID-19 campaigns. Communication and preventive measures should include messages and initiatives toward the maintenance of healthy lifestyles during pandemics such as the adaptation of physical activity and eating guidelines to the particular contexts of mobility restriction and infection control.

T1  - Psychosocial Vulnerabilities to Upper Respiratory Infectious Illness: Implications for Susceptibility to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
A1  - Cohen, Sheldon
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - For 35 years, our laboratory has been involved in identifying psychosocial factors that predict who becomes ill when they are exposed to a virus affecting the upper respiratory tract. To pursue this question, we used a unique viral-challenge design in which we assessed behavioral, social, and psychological factors in healthy adults. We subsequently exposed these adults to a cold or influenza virus and then monitored them in quarantine for 5 to 6 days for onset of respiratory illness. Factors we found to be associated with greater risk of respiratory illnesses after virus exposure included smoking, ingesting an inadequate level of vitamin C, and chronic psychological stress. Those associated with decreased risk included social integration, social support, physical activity, adequate and efficient sleep, and moderate alcohol intake. We cautiously suggest that our findings could have implications for identifying who becomes ill when exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This argument is based on evidence that the associations we report are replicable across multiple respiratory viruses and that the pathways found to link psychosocial factors to colds and influenza may play similar roles in COVID-19.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses., METHODS: After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer., RESULTS: The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings., CONCLUSIONS: Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic with lung disease representing the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Conventional chest-X ray (CXR) and ultrasound (US) are valuable instruments to assess the extent of lung involvement. We investigated the relationship between CXR scores on admission and the level of medical care required in patients with COVID-19. Further, we assessed the CXR-US correlation to explore the role of ultrasound in monitoring the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical features and CXR scores were obtained at admission and correlated with the level of intensity of care required [high- (HIMC) versus low-intensity medical care (LIMC)]. In a subgroup of patients, US findings were correlated with clinical and radiographic parameters. On hospital admission, CXR global score was higher in HIMCs compared to LIMC. Smoking history, pO2 on admission, cardiovascular and oncologic diseases were independent predictors of HIMC. The US score was positively correlated with FiO2 while the correlation with CXR global score only trended towards significance. Our study identifies clinical and radiographic features that strongly correlate with higher levels of medical care. The role of lung ultrasound in this setting remains undetermined and needs to be explored in larger prospective studies.

N2  - North of Italy was severely hit by the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) pandemic. This induced the government to adopt severely restrictive measures to reduce the contagion risk, forcing most of the population to stop working and from leisure activities, and to remain at home for several weeks. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-related quarantine on smoking and dietary habits of a well-characterized northern Italian rural population. For this purpose, while lockdown restrictions were in place (February-April 2020), 359 subjects from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort underwent a phone interview about their lifestyle habit changes during COVID-19-related quarantine. Quarantine did not significantly modify smoking habit nor body mass index. Subjects significantly increased daily carbohydrates consumption, all fresh vegetables, healthy vegetable oils, milk and yogurt, alcoholic drinks, sugars and sweets, and coffee. The weekly consumption of low-fat meat, cured meat other than ham, cheeses, eggs, nuts and mixed seed oils significantly increased, while the weekly intake of fish, mussels, and legumes significantly decreased during lockdown. The Dietary Quality Index was reduced from 42.4 +/- 4.1 to 37.8 +/- 4.7 (p < 0.03). In accordance with our findings, COVID-19-related quarantine might worsen the quality of diet, also leading to an increased intake of almost all food categories.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - We compared the rates of fever in adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory viruses and examined the factors that predict fever in adults. Symptom data on 158 healthcare workers (HCWs) with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection were collected using standardized data collection forms from three separate studies. Overall, the rate of fever in confirmed viral respiratory infections in adult HCWs was 23.4% (37/158). Rates varied by virus: human rhinovirus (25.3%, 19/75), influenza A virus (30%, 3/10), coronavirus (28.6%, 2/7), human metapneumovirus (28.6%, 2/7), respiratory syncytial virus (14.3%, 4/28) and parainfluenza virus (8.3%, 1/12). Smoking [relative risk (RR) 4.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-16.25] and co-infection with two or more viruses (RR 4.19, 95% CI 1.21-14.52) were significant predictors of fever. Fever is less common in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections, including influenza, than described in children. More than 75% of adults with a viral respiratory infection do not have fever, which is an important finding for clinical triage of adult patients with respiratory infections. The accepted definition of 'influenza-like illness' includes fever and may be insensitive for surveillance when high case-finding is required. A more sensitive case definition could be used to identify adult cases, particularly in event of an emerging viral infection.

N2  - E-cigarette use has been increasing among middle school students. Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.

T2  - Cancer du poumon a l'ere du COVID-19: Lung cancer in the COVID-19 era.
A1  - Chouaid, C
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The Covid-19 epidemic has placed considerable strain on healthcare systems in all countries. The impacts are multiple for patients treated for cancer. The objective of this manuscript is to summarize the epidemiological data available on patients with lung cancer developing a Covid infection, in particular the risk factors for aggravation and mortality, to describe the different strategies to improve the management of these patients and to summarize the existing recommendations in this area. The largest cohort on this subject, Teravolt, which included 1012 patients, found a hospitalization rate of 72 %, an aggravation rate of 56 % and a mortality of 32 %. In multivariate analysis, age >=65 years (OR 1.53 CI 1.11-2.1), active smoking (OR 2 CI 1.3-3), metastatic status (OR 1.9 CI 1, 3-2.7), an ECOG PS >=2 (OR 3.7 CI 2.7-5), taking corticosteroids before COVID infection (OR 1.8 CI 1.2-2.7), are associated with a higher risk of mortality but not treatments with chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Interestingly, treatment with immunotherapy appears to decrease the risk of mortality (OR 0.6 CI 0.97)Several screening strategies for asymptomatic forms have been reported in the literature and seem useful for diagnosing asymptomatic forms in patients undergoing systemic treatment or radiotherapy. Finally, national and international recommendations converge on many points, in particular for the need to protect patients and their families from Covid by assessing the benefit / risk of treatment on a case-by-case basis.© 2020 SPLF.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The subpleural sparing pattern is a common finding on computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. It comprises of pulmonary opacities sparing the lung peripheries, typically 1cm and less from the pleural surface. This finding has a variety of causes, including idiopathic, inflammatory, infectious, inhalational, cardiac, traumatic, and bleeding disorders. Specific disorders that can cause subpleural sparing patterns include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), vaping-associated lung injury (VALI), cracked lung, pulmonary edema, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), pulmonary contusion, and more recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Knowledge of the many etiologies of this pattern can be useful in preventing diagnostic errors. In addition, although the etiology of subpleural sparing pattern is frequently indistinguishable during an initial radiologic evaluation, the differences in location of opacities in the lungs, as well as the presence of additional radiologic findings, patient history, and clinical presentation, can often be useful to suggest the appropriate diagnosis. We did a comprehensive search on Pubmed and Google Scholar database using keywords of "subpleural sparing," "peripheral sparing," "sparing of peripheries," "CT chest," "chest imaging," and "pulmonary disease." This review aims to describe the primary differential diagnosis of subpleural sparing pattern seen on chest imaging with a strong emphasis on clinical and radiographic findings. We also discuss the pathogenesis and essential clues that are crucial to narrow the differential diagnosis. Copyright © 2021 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. It has a high transmission rate among humans, and is a threat to global public health. However, there are no effective prophylactics or therapeutics available. It is necessary to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for adequate protection and care against this disease. Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 has angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor, which may lead to the development of severe cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), including strokes, in patients with risk factors for CVD such as diabetes and smoking. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised caution against COVID-19 for smokers and patients with underlying clinical symptoms, including cardiovascular diseases. Here, we observed ACE2 expression in the brain of rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and evaluated the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and diabetes on ACE2 expression in vessels. We showed that the levels of ACE2 expression was increased in the cortex penumbra after ischemic injuries. CSE treatment significantly elevated ACE2 expression in human brain vessels. We found that ACE2 expression was upregulated in primary cultured human blood vessels with diabetes compared to healthy controls. This study demonstrates that ACE2 expression is increased in ischemic brains and vessels exposed to diabetes or smoking, makes them vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - As the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has progressed, there have been marked geographical differences in the pace and extent of its spread. We evaluated the association of BCG vaccination on morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV2, adjusted for country-specific responses to the epidemic, demographics and health. SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths as reported by 31 May 2020 in the World Health Organization situation reports were used. Countries with at least 28 days following the first 100 cases, and available information on BCG were included. We used log-linear regression models to explore associations of cases and deaths with the BCG vaccination policy in each country, adjusted for population size, gross domestic product, proportion aged over 65 years, stringency level measures, testing levels, smoking proportion, and the time difference from date of reporting the 100th case to 31 May 2020. We further looked at the association that might have been found if the analyses were done at earlier time points. The study included 97 countries with 73 having a policy of current BCG vaccination, 13 having previously had BCG vaccination, and 11 having never had BCG vaccination. In a log-linear regression model there was no effect of country-level BCG status on SARS-CoV2 cases or deaths. Univariable log-linear regression models showed a trend towards a weakening of the association over time. We found no statistical evidence for an association between BCG vaccination policy and either SARS-CoV2 morbidity or mortality. We urge countries to rather consider alternative tools with evidence supporting their effectiveness for controlling SARS-CoV2 morbidity and mortality.

T1  - Correlation of D-xylose with severity and morbidity-related factors of COVID-19 and possible therapeutic use of D-xylose and antibiotics for COVID-19.
A1  - Cheudjeu, Antony
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic that currently affects the entire world has been shown to be especially dangerous in the elderly (>=65 years) and in smokers, with notably strong comorbidity in patients already suffering from chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and hypertension. Inflammation of the lungs is the main factor leading to respiratory distress in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in patients with severe COVID-19. Several studies have shown that inflammation of the lungs in general and Type 2 diabetes are accompanied by the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS). Several studies have also shown the importance of countering the degradation of HS in lung infections and Type 2 diabetes. D-xylose, which is the initiating element for different sulfate GAG chains (especially HS), has shown regeneration properties for GAGs. D-xylose and xylitol have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiglycemic, antiviral, and antibacterial properties in lung infections, alone or in combination with antibiotics. Considering the existing research on COVID-19 and related to D-xylose/xylitol, this review offers a perspective on why the association between D-xylose and antibiotics may contribute to significantly reducing the duration of treatment of COVID-19 patients and why some anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the severity of COVID-19. A strong correlation with scurvy, based on gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, and obesity status, is also reviewed. Related to this, the effects of treatment with plants such as Artemisia are also addressed.

T1  - Perceived risk of infection and smoking behavior change during COVID-19 in Ohio.
A1  - Chertok, Ilana R Azulay
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The recent COVID-19 pandemic may catalyze smoking behavior modification. The purpose of the study was to examine factors associated with reducing smoking exposure during the COVID-19 outbreak., DESIGN: Cross-sectional design using the Health Belief Model to develop an online survey distributed throughout Ohio early during the outbreak., SAMPLE: 810 adults in Ohio (77.9% non-smokers, 22.1% current smokers)., MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic factors, smoking and behavior changes since the COVID-19 outbreak, and perceived risk of infection were collected. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with indoor smoking bans and factors associated with desire to quit smoking since the outbreak., RESULTS: For the overall sample, the odds of indoor smoking bans were significantly associated with never smoked, college education, single-family residence, not living with smokers, and perceived importance of avoiding public places. For smokers, the desire to quit smoking since the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with diabetes and perceived risk of severe infection., CONCLUSIONS: Identified factors inform residential smoking exposure reduction through indoor smoking bans. Having an increased perceived risk of severe infection among smokers may motivate cessation. Public health nurses can provide accurate and accessible resources for smoking cessation during the COVID-19 pandemic to promote healthy lifestyle modification.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the Black/African American communities in the U.S. The objective of this study is to understand the change in cigar smoking patterns and motivations to quit cigars during the COVID-19 pandemic among Black young adult cigar smokers., Methods: During May-June 2020, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted to investigate cigar (i.e., large cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, and blunts) smoking behaviors during the pandemic among self-identified, non-Hispanic Black/African American young adult cigar smokers (n = 40; ages 21-29). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded separately by three coders. Thematic analysis was used to assess thematic patterns arising from the interviews., Results: Most participants reported smoking cigarillos and blunts in higher frequency and quantity to cope with COVID-19-induced stress, anxiety, loneliness, and boredom due to economic losses and physical isolation. Some also reported contextual changes in cigarillo and blunt smoking, including smoking around the clock, smoking immediately after waking up, and smoking an entire cigarillo or blunt in one setting. Very few participants reported motivations to quit cigars during the pandemic. Perceiving higher risks of progressed COVID-19 outcomes did not prompt participants' increased motivations for quitting cigars., Conclusions: Black young adults in this study increasingly smoked cigarillos and blunts during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly attributed to daily life stressors. Participants did not have increased motivations for quitting cigars to reduce COVID-19-related risks. Promoting contextually appropriate healthy coping and cigar smoking cessation may minimize COVID-19-related health consequences of cigar smoking and reduce health disparities among Black young adults.

N2  - We studied 1859 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 from seven centers in Wuhan 1651 of whom recovered and 208 died. We interrogated diverse covariates for correlations with risk of death from COVID-19. In multi-variable Cox regression analyses increased hazards of in-hospital death were associated with several admission covariates: (1) older age (HR = 1.04; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.03, 1.06 per year increase; P < 0.001); (2) smoking (HR = 1.84 [1.17, 2.92]; P = 0.009); (3) admission temperature per degreeC increase (HR = 1.32 [1.07, 1.64]; P = 0.009); (4) Log10 neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; HR = 3.30 [2.10, 5.19]; P < 0.001); (5) platelets per 10 E + 9/L decrease (HR = 0.996 [0.994, 0.998]; P = 0.001); (6) activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) per second increase (HR = 1.04 [1.02, 1.05]; P < 0.001); (7) Log10 D-dimer per mg/l increase (HR = 3.00 [2.17, 4.16]; P < 0.001); and (8) Log10 serum creatinine per mumol/L increase (HR = 4.55 [2.72, 7.62]; P < 0.001). In piecewise linear regression analyses Log10NLR the interval from >=0.4 to <=1.0 was significantly associated with an increased risk of death. Our data identify covariates associated with risk of in hospital death in persons with COVID-19.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The relationship between outdoor atmospheric pollution by particulate matter and the morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections was recently disclosed, yet the role of indoor aerosols is poorly known . Since people spend most of their time indoor, indoor aerosols are closer to human occupants than outdoors, thus favoring airborne transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, here we review the characteristics of aerosol particles emitted from indoor sources, and how exposure to particles affects human respiratory infections and transport of airborne pathogens. We found that tobacco smoking, cooking, vacuum cleaning, laser printing, burning candles, mosquito coils and incenses generate large quantities of particles, mostly in the ultrafine range below 100 nm. These tiny particles stay airborne, are deposited in the deeper regions of human airways and are difficult to be removed by the respiratory system. As a consequence, adverse effects can be induced by inhaled aerosol particles via oxidative stress and inflammation. Early epidemiological evidence and animal studies have revealed the adverse effects of particle exposure in respiratory infections. In particular, inhaled particles can impair human respiratory systems and immune functions, and induce the upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus inducing higher vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, co-production of inflammation mediators by COVID-19 infection and particle exposure magnifies the cytokine storm and aggravates symptoms in patients. We also discuss the role of indoor aerosol particles as virus carriers. Although many hypotheses were proposed, there is still few knowledge on interactions between aerosol articles and virus-laden droplets or droplet nuclei.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is probably systemic, has a major respiratory component, and is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets or aerosols. In the respiratory tract, the virus begins to replicate within cells, after which the host starts shedding the virus. The individuals recognized as being at risk for an unfavorable COVID-19 outcome are those > 60 years of age, those with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, those with hypertension, and those with chronic lung diseases, as well as those using chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or biological agents. Some studies have suggested that infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with other risk factors, such as smoking, external environmental pollution, and certain climatic conditions. The purpose of this narrative review was to perform a critical assessment of the relationship between COVID-19 and these potential risk factors.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 epidemics raises a considerable issue of public health at the planetary scale. There is a pressing urgency to find treatments based upon currently available scientific knowledge. Therefore, we tentatively propose a hypothesis which hopefully might ultimately help save lives. Based on the current scientific literature and on new epidemiological data which reveal that current smoking status appears to be a protective factor against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 [1], we hypothesize that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 infection and might represent a target for the prevention and control of Covid-19 infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The first confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in the United States was reported from the state of Washington in January, 2020. By March, 2020, New York City had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States., METHODS: We tracked all patients with confirmed coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Data were obtained through manual review of electronic medical records. Patients had at least 30 days of follow-up., RESULTS: Our first 300 ICU patients were admitted March 10 through April 11, 2020. The majority (60.7%) of patients were men. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was documented in 91.7% of patients; 91.3% required mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning was employed in 58% of patients and neuromuscular blockade in 47.8% of mechanically-ventilated patients. Neither intervention was associated with decreased mortality. Vasopressors were required in 77.7% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was present on admission in 40.7% of patients, and developed subsequently in 36.0%; 50.9% of patients with AKI received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.3%, and 55.8% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In univariate analysis, higher mortality rate was associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, number of comorbidities, AKI on presentation, and need for vasopressor support. A representative multivariable model for 30-day mortality is also presented, containing patient age, gender, body mass index, and AKI at admission. As of May 11, 2020, 2 patients (0.7%) remained hospitalized., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in critical illness associated with COVID-19 is high. The majority of patients develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-dependent shock, and AKI. The variation in mortality rates reported to date likely reflects differences in the severity of illness of the evaluated populations.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic is marked by a wide range of clinical disease courses, ranging from asymptomatic to deadly. There have been many studies seeking to explore the correlations between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and various clinical variables, including age, sex, race, underlying medical problems, and social habits. In particular, the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 outcome is controversial, with multiple conflicting reports in the current literature. In this study, we aim to analyze how smoking may affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. We analyzed sequencing data from lung and oral epithelial samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the receptor and transmembrane protease necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, were upregulated in smoking samples from both lung and oral epithelial tissue. We then explored the mechanistic hypothesis that smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression through the upregulation of the androgen pathway. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 upregulation were both correlated to androgen pathway enrichment and the specific upregulation of central pathway regulatory genes. These data provide a potential model for the increased susceptibility of smoking patients to COVID-19 and encourage further exploration into the androgen and tobacco upregulation of ACE2 to understand the potential clinical ramifications.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Evidence on perinatal mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its potential determinants is limited. Therefore, this multinational study aimed to assess the mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the pandemic, and to explore potential associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress and women's sociodemographic, health, and reproductive characteristics., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK between 16 June and 14 July 2020. Pregnant and breastfeeding women up to 3 months postpartum who were older than 18 years of age were eligible. The online, anonymous survey was promoted through social media and hospital websites. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess mental health status. Regression model analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor mental health status., RESULTS: In total, 9041 women participated (including 3907 pregnant and 5134 breastfeeding women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS >= 13) was 15% in the pregnancy cohort and and 13% the breastfeeding cohort. Moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD >= 10) were found among 11% and 10% of the pregnant and breastfeeding women. The mean (+/-SD) PSS scores for pregnant and breastfeeding women were 14.1 +/- 6.6 and 13.7 +/- 6.6, respectively. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking, having an unplanned pregnancy, professional status, and living in the UK or Ireland., CONCLUSIONS: This multinational study found high levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety among pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings underline the importance of monitoring perinatal mental health during pandemics and other societal crises to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan city has spread rapidly around the world. The risk for poor outcome dramatically increases once a patient progresses to the severe or critical stage. The present study aims to investigate the risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study that included 1007 individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan. Clinical characteristics and baseline laboratory findings were collected. Patients were followed up for 28 days for observation of disease progression. The end point was the progression to a more severe disease stage., RESULTS: During a follow up of 28 days, 720 patients (71.50%) had recovered or were symptomatically stable, 222 patients (22.05%) had progressed to severe disease, 22 patients (2.18%) had progressed to the critically ill stage and 43 patients (4.27%) had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models identified that increased age (hazard ratio (HR) 2.56, 95% CI 1.97-3.33), male sex (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41-2.28), presence of hypertension (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.88), diabetes (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35-2.44), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93) and coronary artery disease (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.26-2.66) were risk factors for disease progression. History of smoking was protective against disease progression (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.90), urea nitrogen (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.21-2.43), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.26-7.21) and D-dimer (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.12-3.58) at baseline were also associated with risk for disease progression., CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a panel of risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19.

N2  - The emergency caused by Covid-19 pandemic raised interest in studying lifestyles and comorbidities as important determinants of poor Covid-19 prognosis. Data on tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity are still limited, while no data are available on the role of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTP). To clarify the role of tobacco smoking and other lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity and progression, we designed a longitudinal observational study titled COvid19 and SMOking in ITaly (COSMO-IT). About 30 Italian hospitals in North, Centre and South of Italy joined the study. Its main aims are: 1) to quantify the role of tobacco smoking and smoking cessation on the severity and progression of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients; 2) to compare smoking prevalence and severity of the disease in relation to smoking in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus patients treated at home; 3) to quantify the association between other lifestyle factors, such as e-cigarette and HTP use, alcohol and obesity and the risk of unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Socio-demographic, lifestyle and medical history information will be gathered for around 3000 hospitalized and 700-1000 home-isolated, laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19 patients. Given the current absence of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2 and the lack of a specific treatment for -COVID-19, prevention strategies are of extreme importance. This project, designed to highly contribute to the international scientific debate on the role of avoidable lifestyle habits on COVID-19 severity, will provide valuable epidemiological data in order to support important recommendations to prevent COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic burst onto the international scene as a new disease not affecting patients uniformly; hence it has risen many questions yet to be clarified. The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19., METHODS: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified., RESULTS: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which are tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe Covid-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially below smoking prevalence in the corresponding populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers., CONCLUSIONS: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.

N2  - In the first stages of the pandemic, the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were significantly higher in men than in women most likely as the effect of biological, hormonal, metabolic differences between the two sexes. However, gender-related differences in lifestyles and social roles can also greatly influence the course of disease. To fully understand the influence of gender in the COVID-19 outbreak, the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data must be enhanced to allow a better knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men and women, not only from a biomedical point of view, but also considering the risk factors associated with the different roles that they play in the society.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To study the prevalence of olfactory loss and its associated factors in a Mexican population a cross-sectional analytical study based on a population interviewed about health, epidemiologic aspects, and sense of smell (tested with four scents: rose, banana, perfume, and gas) was conducted to evaluate olfactory detection, memory, and identification. Levels of sense of smell perception were determined when the participants detected, recognized, or identified all (normosmia), 1-3 (hyposmia), or none (anosmia) of the odorants. Associated factors of olfactory dysfunction were identified by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95%CI)., RECENT FINDINGS: Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population. In addition to viral infection, including COVID-19, a number of other causes and factors may also be involved. 1,956 surveys were conducted and 1,921 were analyzed. Most of the participants (62.1%) were women. The general prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, regarding detection, was 7.2% (7.1% hyposmia, 0.1% anosmia). Age-related olfactory deterioration was observed in both sexes from the 5th decade of life (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050). Women showed better olfactory identification (OR 0.73, p = 0.0010). Obesity (OR 1.97, p = 0.0070), low educational level, bad/very bad self-perceived olfactory function (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050), olfactory loss for less than one week (OR 1.35, p = 0.0030), exposure to toxics/irritants (OR 1.31, p = 0.0030), active smoking (OR 1.58, p < 0.0010), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.74-4.10, p < 0.0001) were identified as factors associated with olfactory dysfunction. These results in a Mexican population suggest better olfactory identification (verbalization) in females. Age was a determining factor in the olfactory deterioration process and obesity and diabetes mellitus were also associated with olfactory disorders. Finally, these findings reinforce the differential diagnosis with other potential causes of sense of smell loss, during the COVID-19 outbreak.

N2  - Dear Editor, The recent and explosive worldwide outbreak of Covid-19 leads many scientists and clinicians to identify the most responsible triggering risk factors in individuals without comorbidities, as well as potential prognostic factors. A notable field of research has been conducted on the role of smoking, which has been initially hypothesized as being a protective factor for Covid-19....

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The high mortality observed in Covid-19 patients may be related to unrecognized pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis, or other underlying cardiovascular diseases. Recent data have highlighted that the mortality rate of Covid-19 seems to be higher in male patients compared to females. In this paper, we have analyzed possible factors that may underline this sex difference in terms of activity of the immune system and its modulation by sex hormones, coagulation pattern, and preexisting cardiovascular diseases as well as effects deriving from smoking and drinking habits. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effects of sex differences on the prevalence of infections, including Covid-19, its outcome, and the responses to antiviral treatments.

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, about 60 million of Italians stayed at home. These circumstances may generate exceptional challenges and stress for people who regularly use cigarettes, ecigarettes, heated tobacco products, dual users, former smokers and never smokers. Here, we present results from a study that was aimed at surveying smoking behaviour and psychological dynamics during the Italian COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home policies. Participants living in Italy were invited to complete an online brief questionnaire. A questionnaire was prepared and uploaded in an online survey tool. They were asked to participate regardless of their current smoking status and were divided in seven subgroups. In total, 1825 participants were included in the analysis. Exclusive cigarette smokers; Dual users of cigarette and ecigarettes; Dual users of cigarette and heated tobacco products; Former smokers; Exclusive users of e-cigarette; Exclusive users of heated tobacco products; never smoker. Dual users of cigarette and e-cigarette and exclusive cigarette smokers perceived that their daily consumption has slightly decreased. Exclusive cigarette smokers and exclusive e-cigarette users changed the way of purchasing products. Most exclusive cigarette smokers have considered quitting but most exclusive e-cigarette users have not considered stopping the use of e-cigarettes. In former smokers' group, about one third of participants declared thoughts about starting to smoke again and in never smokers' group few participants declared intention to start smoking. The COVID-19 era could be considered a "transition" phase and as such requires a search for a new balance. These changes in everyday habits can be a significant moment to use established and emerging strategies to create a definitive smoke-free world. ©Copyright: the Author(s).

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) globally., DESIGN: Publicly available register-based ecological study., SETTING: Two hundred and nine countries/territories in the world., PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated data including 10 445 656 confirmed COVID-19 cases., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 CFR and crude cause-specific death rate were calculated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website., RESULTS: The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2%-3% worldwide and higher than previously reported at 0.7%-1.3%. A doubling in size of a population is associated with a 0.48% (95% CI 0.25% to 0.70%) increase in COVID-19 CFR, and a doubling in the proportion of female smokers is associated with a 0.55% (95% CI 0.09% to 1.02%) increase in COVID-19 CFR. The open testing policies are associated with a 2.23% (95% CI 0.21% to 4.25%) decrease in CFR. The strictness of anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but the higher Stringency Index was associated with higher CFR in higher-income countries with active testing policies (regression coefficient beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27). Inverse associations were found between cardiovascular disease death rate and diabetes prevalence and CFR., CONCLUSION: The association between population size and COVID-19 CFR may imply the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in women and COVID-19 CFR might be due to the finding that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly the income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations. Spatial dependence and temporal trends in the data should be taken into account in global joint strategy and/or policy making against the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The confinement recommended during COVID-19 pandemic could affect behavior and health., METHODS: We conducted a self-reported survey in northern Italy to observe the lockdown effects on lifestyle changes and to assess their determinants. Prevalence Odds Ratio and Prevalence Risk Ratio were determined., RESULTS: 490 adults (84% female) completed the survey: 13% and 43% reported improved and unchanged sleep quality, respectively, while 43% had insomnia symptoms. Among the 272 active subjects in pre-lockdown, 14% continued habitual exercising, 18% increased it and 68% reduced it; 27% of sedentary subjects started physical exercise; 34% reported an improvement in diet quality; 42% increased food intake and 13% decreased it; and 38% of the smokers increased cigarette consumption. Age and the pre-lockdown habit of regular physical exercising were the mainly determinants of lifestyle changes whereas BMI, gender, and the presence of chronic diseases did not. Living with other people increased the likelihood of increasing the food intake (p = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: More than a third of people were able to positively reorganize their lives during the forced home confinement. It is worth to disseminate information to preserve a healthy lifestyle even when confined at home.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the prevalence of smoking rates and comorbidities and evaluate the relationship between them and disease severity and mortality in inpatients with COVID-19., METHODS: COVID-19 patients were divided into the following groups: clinic group, intensive care unit (ICU) group, survivors, and non-survivors. Non-COVID-19 patients were included as a control group. The groups were compared., RESULTS: There was no difference between patients with and without COVID-19 in terms of smoking, asthma, diabetes, dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic renal failure and arrhythmia (p>0.05). Older age (Odds ratio (OR), 1.061; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.041-1.082; p< 0.0001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 2.775; 95% CI: 1.128-6.829; p=0.026) and CAD (OR, 2.696; 95% CI: 1.216-5.974; p=0.015) were significantly associated with ICU admission. Current smoking (OR, 5.101; 95% CI: 2.382-10.927; p<0.0001) and former smoking (OR, 3.789; 95% CI: 1.845-7.780; p<0.0001) were risk factors for ICU admission. Older age (OR; 1.082; 95% CI: 1.056-1.109; p<0.0001), COPD (OR, 3.213; 95% CI: 1.224-8.431; p=0.018), CAD (OR, 6.252; 95% CI: 2.171-18.004; p=0.001) and congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR, 5.917; 95% CI 1.069-32.258; p=0.042), were significantly associated with mortality. Current smoking (OR, 13.014; 95% CI: 5.058-33.480; p<0.0001) and former smoking (OR, 6.507; 95% CI 2.731-15.501; p<0.0001) were also risk factors for mortality., CONCLUSION: Smoking, older age, COPD, and CAD were risk factors for ICU admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19. CHF was not a risk factor for ICU admission; however, it was a risk factor for mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has spread worldwide. The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI >= 24and < 24., RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI >= 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI >= 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI >= 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI >= 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI < 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI >= 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course. Thus, high BMI is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19.

N2  - The COVID-19 related high morbidity and mortality have led to a common fear and anxiety. This study aimed to determine the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and COVID-19 pneumonia. The study was conducted at the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Central Anatolia of Turkey. 120 patients with myocardial infarction , 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 120 healthy volunteers as a control group were included in the study. The participants filled out the questionnaire that included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Thorson-Powell's Revised Death Anxiety Scale (RDAS). All scores of patient groups were significantly higher than the control group. There was no significant difference in terms of STAI-S, STAI-T, and RDAS scores between COVID-19 pneumonia and MI groups. The anxiety risk increased 2.14-fold for STAI-T and 1.97-fold for STAI-S in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared to the control group. In this study, the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were as high as patients with myocardial infarction.COVID-19 pneumonia-related anxiety was associated with chronic diseases and smoking. Knowing the level of anxiety in these patients is important to provide better health services in the emergency departments.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Personal protective equipment (PPE) use is frequently construed as inconvenient and disturbing by healthcare professionals (HCPs). We hypothesized that new-onset symptoms among HCPs may be associated with extended use of PPE and aimed to investigate risk factors related with new-onset symptoms. In addition, the effects of new-onset symptoms on working performance were evaluated., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 315 participants filled out a questionnaire that contains four main parts: 1) Demographics, 2) New-onset symptoms with PPE use, 3) PPE usage hours, 4) Personal opinion about the effect of sensed symptoms on working performance., RESULTS: The mean age was 31.58 +/- 4.6 years, and 50.5% (n=159) were female. New-onset symptom rate was 66% (n=208). The most common new-onset symptom was headache (n=115, 36.5%) followed by breathing difficulty-palpitation (n=79, 25.1%) and dermatitis (n=64, 20.3%). Extended use of PPE, smoking, and overweight were independently associated with developing new-onset symptoms. A clear majority of symptomatic participants pointed out impact on working performance (193/208, 92.7%)., CONCLUSION: Hospitals should take the necessary precautions (e.g. shorter shifts and more often breaks) to prevent symptoms associated with PPE and ensure that HCPs comply with these precautions.

T1  - Coronavirus: Why Men are More Vulnerable to Covid-19 Than Women?.
A1  - Bwire, George M
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Amid of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, much emphasis was initially placed on the elderly or those who have preexisting health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as being at high risk of contracting and/or dying of Covid-19. But it is now becoming clear that being male is also a factor. The epidemiological findings reported across different parts of the world indicated higher morbidity and mortality in males than females. While it is still too early to determine why the gender gap is emerging, this article point to several possible factors such as higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2; receptors for coronavirus) in male than female, sex-based immunological differences driven by sex hormone and X chromosome. Furthermore, a large part of this difference in number of deaths is caused by gender behavior (lifestyle), i.e., higher levels of smoking and drinking among men compared to women. Lastly, studies reported that women had more responsible attitude toward the Covid-19 pandemic than men. Irresponsible attitude among men reversibly affect their undertaking of preventive measures such as frequent handwashing, wearing of face mask, and stay at home orders.

N2  - Tobacco and cannabis use, alcohol consumption and inactivity are health risk behaviors (HRB) of crucial importance for health and wellbeing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students' engagement in HRB has yet received limited attention. We investigated whether HRB changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, assessed factors associated with change and profiles of HRB changes in university students. A web-based survey was conducted in May 2020, including 5021 students of four German universities (69% female, the mean age of 24.4 years (SD = 5.1)). Sixty-one percent of students reported consuming alcohol, 45.8% binge drinking, 44% inactivity, 19.4% smoking and 10.8% cannabis use. While smoking and cannabis use remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24.4% reported a decrease in binge drinking while 5.4% reported an increase. Changes to physical activity were most frequently reported, with 30.6% reporting an increase and 19.3% reporting a decrease in vigorous physical activity. Being female, younger age, being bored, not having a trusted person and depressive symptoms were factors associated with a change in HRB. Five substance use behavior profiles were identified, which also remained fairly unchanged. Efforts to promote student health and wellbeing continue to be required, also in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The new severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a huge health, social and economic issue and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Bladder cancer, on the contrary, is a well-known disease burdened by a high rate of affected patients and risk of recurrence, progression and death., SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) often involves mild clinical symptoms but in some cases, it can lead to pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Factors associated with developing a more severe disease are increased age, obesity, smoking and chronic underlying comorbidities (including diabetes mellitus). High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) progression and worse prognosis are also characterized by a higher incidence in patients with risk factors similar to COVID-19. Immune system response and inflammation have been found as a common hallmark of both diseases. Most severe cases of COVID-19 and high-risk NMIBC patients at higher recurrence and progression risk are characterized by innate and adaptive immune activation followed by inflammation and cytokine/chemokine storm (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8). Alterations in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets accompany the systemic inflammatory response to cancer and infections. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for example have been recognized as factors related to poor prognosis for many solid tumors, including bladder cancer, and their role has been found important even for the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key Messages: All these mechanisms should be further analyzed in order to find new therapeutic agents and new strategies to block infection and cancer progression. Further than commonly used therapies, controlling cytokine production and inflammatory response is a promising field. Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be an important complication of HIV infection. Rates of pneumonia decrease with the use of antiretroviral therapy but continue to be higher than in HIV uninfected individuals. Risk factors for pneumonia include low blood CD4+ count, unsuppressed plasma HIV load, smoking, injection drug use and renal impairment. Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and smoking cessation can reduce this risk. It is unclear whether newly reported viral respiratory pathogens (such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, will be more of a problem in HIV-infected individuals than the general population.

N2  - Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2), lysosomal endopeptidase Cathepsin L (CTSL), subtilisin-like proprotein peptidase furin (FURIN), and even potentially membrane bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The distribution and expression of many of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has recently been demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remains unclear. Here, we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes, as well as potential downstream effector genes such as bradykinin receptors, are modulated in the target organs of select disease states. In tissues, such as the heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, we found the increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer, or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and we suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.

N2  - The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and "heat-not-burn" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid-19.

T1  - The incidence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with critically ill non-COVID patients.
A1  - Boyd, Sean
A1  - Martin-Loeches, Ignacio
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that is currently responsible for the global pandemic. It has been reported that up to 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop VTE (venous thromboembolism), and this can be as high as 31% in ICU patients with COVID-19 [2]., AIMS: To determine VTE rates in ICU patients with COVID compared to those admitted with influenza and a control group., METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients admitted to ICU at our hospital. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, coagulation profile and prevalence of radiologically proven VTE were recorded and compared between groups., RESULTS: More males than females were found in each group. When groups were compared the mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar, as was the incidence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. aPTT was higher in the COVID-19 (30.9 +/- 3.7 SD) vs (12.8 +/- 4.1 SD) the influenza group vs (15.2 +/- 4.1 SD) in controls p < 0.001, but fibrinogen was lower 6.2 +/- 1.6 SD vs 34.6 +/- 14.0SD vs 30.8 +/- 5.0 SD, respectively, p < 0.001. VTE rates in the COVID (13.2%) (DVT 5.3%, PE 10.5%) and influenza groups (15.8%) (DVT 13.2%, PE 2.6%) were similar but were higher than the control group (8.1%) (DVT 8.1%, PE 2.7%), but not significantly so (p = 0.5)., CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with COVID-19 displayed an abnormal coagulation profile and a VTE rate that is similar to ICU patients with influenza. VTE occurred despite thromboprophylaxis and remains a pertinent differential to keep in mind.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Objective of this case report is to draw attention to a less known thrombotic complication associated with COVID-19, i.e., thrombosis of both radial arteries, with possible (long-term) consequences., THE CASE: In our COVID-19 ICU a 49-year-old male patient was admitted, with past medical history of obesity, smoking and diabetes, but no reported atherosclerotic complications. The patient had been admitted with severe hypoxemia and multiple pulmonary emboli were CT-confirmed. ICU-treatment included mechanical ventilation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Preparing the insertion of a new radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure measurement and blood sampling, we detected that both radial arteries were non-pulsating and occluded: (a) Sonography showed the typical anatomical localization of both radial and ulnar arteries. However, Doppler-derived flow-signals could only be obtained from the ulnar arteries. (b) To test collateral arterial supply of the hand, a pulse-oximeter was placed on the index finger. Thereafter, the ulnar artery at the wrist was compressed. This compression caused an immediate loss of the finger's pulse-oximetry perfusion signal. The effect was reversible upon release of the ulnar artery. (c) To test for collateral perfusion undetectable by pulse-oximetry, we measured regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the thenar muscle by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Confirming our findings above, ulnar arterial compression demonstrated that thenar rSO2 was dependent on ulnar artery flow. The described development of bilateral radial artery occlusion in a relatively young and therapeutically anticoagulated patient with no history of atherosclerosis was unexpected., CONCLUSIONS: Since COVID-19 patients are at increased risk for arterial occlusion, it appears advisable to meticulously check for adequacy of collateral (hand-) perfusion, avoiding the harm of hand ischemia if interventions (e.g., catheterizations) at the radial or ulnar artery are intended.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social distancing-when people limit close contact with others outside their household-is a primary intervention available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of social distancing is unlikely to change until effective treatments or vaccines become widely available. However, relatively little is known about how best to promote social distancing. Applying knowledge from social and behavioral research on conventional health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) to support public health efforts and research on social distancing is promising, but empirical evidence supporting this approach is needed., PURPOSE: We examined whether one type of social distancing behavior-reduced movement outside the home-was associated with conventional health behaviors., METHOD: We examined the association between GPS-derived movement behavior in 2,858 counties in USA from March 1 to April 7, 2020 and the prevalence of county-level indicators influenced by residents' conventional health behaviors., RESULTS: Changes in movement were associated with conventional health behaviors, and the magnitude of these associations were similar to the associations among the conventional health behaviors. Counties with healthier behaviors-particularly less obesity and greater physical activity-evidenced greater reduction in movement outside the home during the initial phases of the pandemic in the USA., CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing, in the form of reduced movement outside the home, is associated with conventional health behaviors. Existing scientific literature on health behavior and health behavior change can be more confidently used to promote social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - The pandemic caused by Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a great concern for public and mental health systems worldwide. The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased their smoking, while others decreased it. In this study, we examined a possible explanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress., METHODS: We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch current smokers from 11-18 May 2020 (n=957). During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands. Included in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased smoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19., RESULTS: Overall, while 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.9% of smokers reported smoking more. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: smokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.49-3.78) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.07-3.05) their smoking. Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased (OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84-7.64) or reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70-9.28) their smoking. Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, independently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit., CONCLUSIONS: Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers in different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it. While boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated others to improve their health by quitting smoking. These data highlight the importance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the importance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Mass media are a leading source of health information for general public. We wished to examine the relationship between the intensity of media coverage for selected health topics and their actual risk to public health., METHODS: Mass media reports in the United States on emerging and chronic health hazards (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bioterrorism, West Nile Fever, AIDS, smoking and physical inactivity) were counted for the year 2003, using LexisNexis database. The number of media reports for each health risk was correlated with the corresponding death rate as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., RESULTS: The number of media reports inversely correlated with the actual number of deaths for the health risks evaluated. SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people in 2003, but together generated over 100 000 media reports, far more than those covering smoking and physical inactivity, which killed nearly a million Americans., CONCLUSIONS: Emerging health hazards are over-reported in mass media by comparison to common threats to public health. Since premature mortality in industrialized societies is most often due to well-known risks such as smoking and physical inactivity, their under-representation on public agendas may cause suboptimal prioritization of public health resources.

N2  - In early December 2019, in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, the first infections by a novel coronavirus were reported. Since then, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading to other cities and countries becoming the global emerging epidemiological issue and quickly reaching the status of a pandemic. Multiple risk factors of disease severity and mortality have been identified so far. These include old age, male sex, smoking, and obesity. This concise narrative review highlights the important role of these factors in the pathobiology and clinical landscape of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We especially focused on their significant role in disease severity and mortality. However, in spite of intensive research, most of the presented pieces of evidence are weak and need further verification.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Various neurological findings including stroke in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, although no clarity exists regarding the nature and pattern of this association. This systematic review aims to report the characteristics of stroke in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: Three authors independently searched Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PubMed starting from inception up to May 22, 2020. The data for individual patients was extracted where available from published reports including clinical and laboratory parameters and analysed for any significant associations between variables., RESULTS: We identified 30 relevant articles involving 115 patients with acute or subacute stroke with COVID-19. The mean+/-standard deviation age was 62.5+/-14.5 years. Stroke was ischemic in majority of the patients (101 [87.8%]). Hypertension (42 [42%]), dyslipidaemia (24 [26.1%]), and diabetes (23 [23.2%]) were the major vascular risk factors. Most of the patients (80 [85.1%]) had COVID-19 symptoms at the time of stroke with a median interval of 10 days to stroke from the diagnosis of COVID-19. Three-fourths (86 [74.8%]) of the patients were critically ill which frequently delayed the diagnosis of stroke. High levels of D-dimer, and ferritin were observed in these patients. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had a high mortality (47.9%). Factors associated with mortality were intensive care unit admission, having two or more vascular risk factors, particularly smoking and high levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase., CONCLUSIONS: The association between stroke and COVID-19 is probably multifactorial including an amalgamation of traditional vascular risk factors, proinflammatory and a prothrombotic state. Prospectively collected data is required in the future to confirm this hypothesis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England., METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged >=18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time., RESULTS: 17 282 905 adults were included, of whom 27 480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14 882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2.90 (95% CI 1.96-4.30; p<0.0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.74-3.84; p<0.0001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 4.31 (95% CI 2.42-7.65) versus 1.84 (1.03-3.26) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0.044)., INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves., FUNDING: Wellcome, Royal Society, National Institute for Health Research, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK Medical Research Council, Health Data Research UK.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present as a range of symptoms, from mild to critical; lower pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia, is often associated with severe and critical cases. Understanding the baseline characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness is essential for effectively targeting clinical care and allocating resources. This study aimed to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement., METHODS: US patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement during an inpatient admission from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020, were identified using the IBM Explorys R electronic health records database. Baseline (up to 12 months prior to first COVID-19 hospitalization) demographics and clinical characteristics and preadmission (14 days to 1 day prior to admission) pulmonary diagnoses were assessed. Patients were stratified by sex, age, race, and geographic region., RESULTS: Overall, 3471 US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement were included. The mean (SD) age was 63.5 (16.3) years; 51.2% of patients were female, 55.0% African American, 81.6% from the South, and 16.8% from the Midwest. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (27.7%), diabetes (17.3%), hyperlipidemia (16.3%), and obesity (9.7%). Cough (27.3%) and dyspnea (15.2%) were the most common preadmission pulmonary symptoms. African American patients were younger (mean [SD], 62.5 [15.4] vs. 67.8 [6.2]) with higher mean (SD) body mass index (33.66 [9.46] vs. 30.42 [7.86]) and prevalence of diabetes (19.8% vs. 16.7%) and lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.6% vs. 8.2%) and smoking/tobacco use (28.1% vs. 37.2%) than White patients., CONCLUSIONS: Among US patients primarily from the South and Midwest hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Differences observed between African American and White patients should be considered in the context of the complex factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Vaping and vape shops pose risk for COVID-19 and its transmission., OBJECTIVES: We examined vape shop non-compliance with state-ordered business closures during COVID-19, changes in their marketing and experiences among consumers., METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study of vape retail in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Seattle), we conducted: (1) legal research to determine whether statewide COVID-19 orders required vape shops to close; (2) phone-based and web-based surveillance to assess vape shop activity in March-June 2020 during shelter-in-place periods; and (3) a concurrent online survey of e-cigarette users about their experiences with vape retail., RESULTS: Non-essential business closure varied in timing/duration across states and applied to vape shops in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma (for a brief period) and Washington (Georgia's orders were ambiguous). Surveillance analysis focused on the five MSAs in these states. Of 156 vape shops, 53.2% were open as usual, 11.5% permanently closed and 3.8% temporarily closed; 31.4% offered pick-up/delivery services. Among survey respondents (n=354, M age =23.9+/-4.6; 46.9% male, 71.8% white, 13.0% Hispanic), 27.4% worried their vape shop would close/go out of business during COVID-19; 7.3% said their vape shop did so. Few noticed increases in vape product delivery options (7.3%), discounts/price promotions (9.9%) and/or prices (9.3%). While 20.3% stockpiled vape products, 20.3% tried to reduce use and 15.8% tried to quit., CONCLUSIONS: Many vape shops were non-compliant with state COVID-19 orders. E-cigarette users were as likely to stockpile vape products as to attempt to reduce or quit using e-cigarettes. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. Mexico's population is younger, yet COVID-19's impact on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging., METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for COVID-19 mortality risk prediction., RESULTS: We analyzed 20,804 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged >=60 years. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and combination of structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age alone. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas., CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Clinical features and natural history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) differ widely among different countries and during different phases of the pandemia. Here, we aimed to evaluate the case fatality rate (CFR) and to identify predictors of mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals of Northern Italy between March 1 and April 28, 2020. All these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular methods. During the study period 504/1697 patients died; thus, overall CFR was 29.7%. We looked for predictors of mortality in a subgroup of 486 patients (239 males, 59%; median age 71 years) for whom sufficient clinical data were available at data cut-off. Among the demographic and clinical variables considered, age, a diagnosis of cancer, obesity and current smoking independently predicted mortality. When laboratory data were added to the model in a further subgroup of patients, age, the diagnosis of cancer, and the baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio were identified as independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, the CFR of hospitalized patients in Northern Italy during the ascending phase of the COVID-19 pandemic approached 30%. The identification of mortality predictors might contribute to better stratification of individual patient risk.

N2  - There has been a markedly renewed interest in factors associated with pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide, due to its frequent concurrence with pandemics of influenza and Covid-19 disease. Reported predisposing factors to both bacterial pneumonia and pandemic viral lower respiratory infections are wintertime occurrence, older age, obesity, pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes. Also implicated are age-related neurodegenerative diseases that cause parkinsonism and dementia. We investigated the prevalence of autopsy-proven pneumonia in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study, between the years 2006 and 2019 and before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of 691 subjects dying at advanced ages (mean 83.4), pneumonia was diagnosed postmortem in 343 (49.6%). There were 185 subjects without dementia or parkinsonism while clinicopathological diagnoses for the other subjects included 319 with Alzheimer's disease dementia, 127 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 49 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 78 with vascular dementia. Subjects with one or more of these neurodegenerative diseases all had higher pneumonia rates, ranging between 50 and 61%, as compared to those without dementia or parkinsonism (40%). In multivariable logistic regression models, male sex and a non-summer death both had independent contributions (ORs of 1.67 and 1.53) towards the presence of pneumonia at autopsy while the absence of parkinsonism or dementia was a significant negative predictor of pneumonia (OR 0.54). Male sex, dementia and parkinsonism may also be risk factors for Covid-19 pneumonia. The apolipoprotein E4 allele, as well as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly and cigarette smoking history, were not significantly associated with pneumonia, in contradistinction to what has been reported for Covid-19 disease.

N2  - Background: Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..

N2  - Background: Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..

N2  - AIMS: To process data from the first wave of Covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) collected in the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) of the First Faculty of Medicine and Central Military Hospital, Prague. To analyse some clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Covid-19 in the context of the Czech Republic and to compare them with the data from the most recent literature., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data on patients admitted to the IDC between 12 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The study cohort included 53 patients with Covid-19, 25 females and 28 males, with an average age of 57 years. The parameters analysed were clinical symptoms, average length of hospital stay, complications, and death. Additional data concerned the age, weight, smoking habits, history of comorbidities, and selected laboratory results. These data were compared between groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19. Finally, imaging findings, serology results, and therapy outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaStat software., RESULTS: Eleven (20.8%) patients had a mild course of the disease, 16 (30.2%) patients had a moderate course, 22 (41.5%) patients had a severe course, and four (7.5%) patients had a critical course. The study patients presented with the following clinical symptoms: fever in 88.5% of cases, cough in 84.6% of cases, difficulty breathing in 77.4% of cases, diarrhoea in 23.1% of cases, chest pain in 17.3% of cases, and anosmia in 11.5% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was eight days. The most common complication was a bacterial superinfection, reported in 17 (32.1%) study patients. The overall case fatality rate for Covid-19 in our study was 5.7%. The average age of the study cohort was 57 years, and patients with a severe course of the disease were of older average age than those with a less severe course of the disease (p < 0.05). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The analysis of the baseline laboratory data showed significant differences between the groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19 in CRP, procalcitonin, and d-dimers but not in lymphocyte count. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs was performed in 22 patients, and 21 of them had typical findings for Covid-19. The average MuLBSTA score for Covid-19 pneumonia severity in our study cohort was 11.5 points and was not associated with the severity of the course of the disease. Serology tests were performed in 43 study patients, with 29 (67.4%) of them turning out positive in the first test and other five (11.6%) testing positive when retested. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was given experimentally as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin (AZI) to 24 (45.3%) patients. Two patients on HCQ therapy also received inosinum pranobexum (isoprinosine) for severe lymphopenia, one patient received convalescent plasma, six patients were given AZI alone, and one patient was treated with inosinum pranobexum alone. Altogether 37.7% of study patients were prescribed other antibiotics for confirmed or suspected bacterial superinfection. Standard clinical and pharmaceutical care was provided to patients with particular focus on the safety of off-label drug use. HCQ was with drawn in three patients due to a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc)., CONCLUSIONS: In the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our study patients showed comorbidities and risk factors which are consistent with the international literature, but the course of the disease was mostly moderate to severe, with a low proportion of critically ill patients and fatal outcomes. As soon as new information became available, new diagnostic and therapeutic options were introduced into routine practice. Based on our experience, we are well prepared for a possible second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the diagnostics, but the therapeutic options still remain very limited.

N2  - ACE2 was observed as the cell surface receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Interestingly, we also found ACE2 positivity inside the cell nucleus. The ACE2 levels changed during cell differentiation and aging and varied in distinct cell types. We observed ACE2 depletion in the aortas of aging female mice, similarly, the aging caused ACE2 decrease in the kidneys. Compared with that in the heart, brain and kidneys, the ACE2 level was the lowest in the mouse lungs. In mice exposed to nicotine, ACE2 was not changed in olfactory bulbs but in the lungs, ACE2 was upregulated in females and downregulated in males. These observations indicate the distinct gender-dependent properties of ACE2. Differentiation into enterocytes, and cardiomyocytes, caused ACE2 depletion. The cardiomyogenesis was accompanied by renin upregulation, delayed in HDAC1-depleted cells. In contrast, vitamin D2 decreased the renin level while ACE2 was upregulated. Together, the ACE2 level is high in non-differentiated cells. This protein is more abundant in the tissues of mouse embryos and young mice in comparison with older animals. Mostly, downregulation of ACE2 is accompanied by renin upregulation. Thus, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease should be further studied not only by considering the ACE2 level but also the whole renin-angiotensin system.

N2  - People with serious mental illness are at disproportionate risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality because of high rates of risk factors that directly parallel those related to poor coronavirus outcomes, including smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, along with housing instability, homelessness, food insecurity, and poverty. Community-based behavioral health organizations are also at risk of adverse outcomes because of dramatic declines in revenues and a diminished workforce. The State of Massachusetts has responded to this crisis by rapidly implementing a variety of policy, regulatory, and payment reforms. This column describes some of these reforms, which are designed to enhance remote telehealth delivery of care, ensure access to needed medications and residential care staff, and support the financial livelihood of community-based behavioral health services.

T1  - Self-isolation: A significant contributor to cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A1  - Bartel, S J

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Emerging research suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in self-reported isolation and loneliness in a large proportion of the population. This is particularly concerning given that isolation and loneliness are associated with increased cannabis use, as well as using cannabis to cope with negative affect. Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020. Pre-pandemic cannabis use levels had been collected four months earlier. Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.

T1  - Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?.
A1  - Baron, Yves Muscat
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Air pollution with particulate matter has been implicated in the incidence and the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R0) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus' transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking (66% of Chinese males are smokers), may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19's vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The "open orientation" of Clade G spike protein's three peptides as opposed to the "closed orientation" of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein's hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.

N2  - COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and carries a huge and growing economic and social burden. Telemedicine might allow the care of patients with limited access to health services and improve their self-management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patient's safety represents one of the main reasons why we might use these tools to manage our patients. The authors conducted a literature search in MEDLINE database. The retrieval form of the Medical Subject Headings (Mesh) was ((Telemedicine OR Tele-rehabilitation OR Telemonitoring OR mHealth OR Ehealth OR Telehealth) AND COPD). We only included systematic reviews, reviews, meta-analysis, clinical trials and randomized-control trials, in the English language, with the selected search items in title or abstract, and published from January 1st 2015 to 31st May 2020 (n = 56). There was a positive tendency toward benefits in tele-rehabilitation, health-education and self-management, early detection of COPD exacerbations, psychosocial support and smoking cessation, but the heterogeneity of clinical trials and reviews limits the extent to which this value can be understood. Telemonitoring interventions and cost-effectiveness had contradictory results. The literature on teleconsultation was scarce during this period. The non-inferiority tendency of telemedicine programmes comparing to conventional COPD management seems an opportunity to deliver quality healthcare to COPD patients, with a guarantee of patient's safety, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak.

N2  - Background: In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This might help showing which comorbidity might pose the patients at risk of more severe symptoms., Methods: We searched all relevant databases on April 7th, 2020 using the keywords ("novel coronavirus" OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (comorbidities OR clinical characteristics OR epidemiologic*). We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis., Results: The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45. The most prevalent finding in the confirmed COVID-19 patients was hypertension, which was found in 1/5 of the patients (21%). Other most prevalent finding was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 11%, cerebrovascular disease in 2.4%, cardiovascular disease in 5.8%, chronic kidney disease in 3.6%, chronic liver disease in 2.9%, chronic pulmonary disease in 2.0%, malignancy in 2.7%, and smoking in 8.7% of the patients., Conclusion: COVID-19 infection seems to be affecting every race, sex, age, irrespective of health status. The risk of symptomatic and severe disease might be higher due to the higher age which is usually accompanied with comorbidities. However, comorbidities do not seem to be the prerequisite for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection, except hypertension.

T1  - ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression by clinical, HLA, immune, and microbial correlates across 34 human cancers and matched normal tissues: implications for SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Pandemic COVID-19 by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is facilitated by the ACE2 receptor and protease TMPRSS2. Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Patients with cancer may have worse outcomes to COVID-19., METHODS: We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, body mass index, and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome., RESULTS: Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-beta signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations., CONCLUSIONS: We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

N2  - Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) from two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) provides a more accurate estimation of subclinical myocardial dysfunction. In patients with COVID-19, elevated high sensitive troponin (hs-TnI) levels are frequent independent from the underlying cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between high troponin levels and LVGLS in such patients remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the relation between troponin levels and LVGLS values in patients with COVID-19. A total of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent echocardiography examination within the first week of hospital admission were enrolled in our study. Patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels. Conventional left venticular (LV) function parameters, including ejection fraction, LV diastolic and systolic volumes were obtained and LVGLS was determined using 2D-STE. Frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and current smoking were similar among groups. Compared with the patients in the negative troponin group, those in the positive troponin group were more likely to have a higher age; higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and ferritin; higher need for high-flow oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation therapy or both; and a higher number of intensive care unit admissions. There was no statistically significant difference in LVGLS and ejection fraction values between the two groups.(- 18.5 +/- 2.9, - 19.8 +/- 2.8, p = 0.19; 55.2 +/- 9.9, 59.5 +/- 5.9, p = 0.11 respectively). Despite troponin increase is highly related to in-hospital adverse events; no relevance was found between troponin increase and LVGLS values of COVID-19 patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: On March 20 2020, the Argentine Ministry of Health enforced a mandatory quarantine throughout the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic., AIMS: The object of this study is to determine the initial impact on mental health of Argentine population, by measuring the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and self-perceived stress and by determining the associated risk factors, and to analyze that impact in relation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths., METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through a digital questionnaire, which was completed by 1,985 respondents between March 29 and April 12. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), the 9-Item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively., RESULTS: The 62.4% of the surveyed population reported signs of psychological distress. It was found that being a woman, being 18 to 27 years old, living with family members or a partner, smoking, and having a poor sleep quality were the significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Despite the low number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths at that time, a strong impact on mental health indicators was revealed. The authors of this study recommend the monitoring of the population at risk over time and early interventions in order to avoid long-lasting mental health problems.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Lung cancer patients are at heightened risk for developing COVID-19 infection as well as complications due to multiple risk factors such as underlying malignancy, anti-cancer treatment induced immunosuppression, additional comorbidities and history of smoking. Recent literatures have reported a significant proportion of lung cancer patients coinfected with COVID-19. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and umifenovir represent the major repurposed drugs used as potential experimental agents for COVID-19 whereas azithromycin, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, sarilumab, famotidine and ceftriaxone are some of the supporting agents that are under investigation for COVID-19 management. The rationale of this review is to identify potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occurring in lung cancer patients receiving lung cancer medications and repurposed COVID-19 drugs using Micromedex and additional literatures. This review has identified several potential DDIs that could occur with the concomitant treatments of COVID-19 repurposed drugs and lung cancer medications. This information may be utilized by the healthcare professionals for screening and identifying potential DDIs with adverse outcomes, based on their severity and documentation levels and consequently design prophylactic and management strategies for their prevention. Identification, reporting and management of DDIs and dissemination of related information should be a major consideration in the delivery of lung cancer care during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for better patient outcomes and updating guidelines for safer prescribing practices in this coinfected condition.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which first spread to the People of Republic of China and then to other countries in a short time, affected the whole world by infecting millions of people and have been increasing its impact day by day. Hundreds of researchers in many countries are in search of a solution to end up this pandemic. This study aims to contribute to the literature by performing detailed analyses via a new three-staged framework constructed based on data envelopment analysis and machine learning algorithms to assess the performances of 142 countries against the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly, clustering analyses were made using k-means and hierarchic clustering methods. Subsequently, efficiency analysis of countries were performed by a novel model, the weighted stochastic imprecise data envelopment analysis. Finally, parameters were analyzed with decision tree and random forest algorithms. Results have been analyzed in detail, and the classification of countries are determined by providing the most influential parameters. The analysis showed that the optimum number of clusters for 142 countries is three. In addition, while 20 countries out of 142 countries were fully effective, 36% of them were found to be effective at a rate of 90%. Finally, it has been observed that the data such as GDP, smoking rates, and the rate of diabetes patients do not affect the effectiveness level of the countries. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which first spread to the People of Republic of China and then to other countries in a short time, affected the whole world by infecting millions of people and have been increasing its impact day by day. Hundreds of researchers in many countries are in search of a solution to end up this pandemic. This study aims to contribute to the literature by performing detailed analyses via a new three-staged framework constructed based on data envelopment analysis and machine learning algorithms to assess the performances of 142 countries against the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly, clustering analyses were made using k-means and hierarchic clustering methods. Subsequently, efficiency analysis of countries were performed by a novel model, the weighted stochastic imprecise data envelopment analysis. Finally, parameters were analyzed with decision tree and random forest algorithms. Results have been analyzed in detail, and the classification of countries are determined by providing the most influential parameters. The analysis showed that the optimum number of clusters for 142 countries is three. In addition, while 20 countries out of 142 countries were fully effective, 36% of them were found to be effective at a rate of 90%. Finally, it has been observed that the data such as GDP, smoking rates, and the rate of diabetes patients do not affect the effectiveness level of the countries. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health and economic turmoil across the globe. Severe COVID-19 disease most often presents with pneumonia and complications in acutely ill patients often stem from the lungs. The associations of lung disease, smoking and e-cigarette use with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are unclear on a population level., METHODS: Data on 1761 patients from the Icelandic outpatient Landspitali COVID-19 Clinic were used. The prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use and underlying lung diseases was calculated in the cohort, with stratification based on age groups and a clinical classification of symptom severity. It was tested whether these prevalences differed between age groups and classes of symptom severity., RESULTS: Most patients were in the age group between 35-54 years of age and a large majority had mild symptoms at diagnosis. The prevalence of smoking was 6% with the highest prevalence among 35-54 year olds. The prevalence of e-cigarette use was 4%. It was most prevalent in the age group between 18-34 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of smoking or e-cigarette use between classes of symptom severity. The prevalence of lung disease was 9%. It was higher among older patients and patients with more severe symptoms., CONCLUSION: The age distribution and prevalence of lung disease and their risk factors are described in the context of COVID-19 incidence and symptom severity in a whole-nation cohort of Icelanders. The cohort is younger and had less severe symptoms than in many previosly published studies of COVID-19. Interestingly, the prevalences of smoking and e-cigarette use were lower than in the Icelandic general population and they were not associated with symptom severity at diagnosis. To conclude, the results presented here indicate that underlying lung diseases are prevalent among people with severe COVID-19 symptoms but fail to demonstrate an association between cigarette smoking or e-cigarette smoking with COVID-19 severity.

N2  - Background: The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc., Objective: We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration., Material and methods: We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring., Results: We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the "debate on chloroquine" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine., Discussion: The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the "Western man" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences., Conclusion: Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We compared the clinical characteristics, findings, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences., METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at a tertiary care hospital in Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for 3 months from admission., RESULTS: We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs. 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs. 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs. 15 [45%], p=.03 and 1 [4%] vs. 10 [30%], p=.008). In chest X-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], p<.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs. 19 [58%], p=.003 and 8 [29%] vs. 2 [6%], p=.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (six days [IQR 4-21] vs. 3 [2-4], p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral GGOs and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.

N2  - Introduction: the aim of this work is to evaluate the contribution of thoracic computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Guinea., Methods: this was a retrospective study with data recorded over a 2 Month period. Records of patients who tested positive on chest CT without contrast injection on admission were included in this study. Not included are those who did or did not perform a chest CT scan after confirmation of the diagnosis by RT-PCR. The data were collected under the direction of the National Health Security Agency (ANSS) and analysed using STATA/SE version 11.2 software., Results: all patients tested performed a chest CT scan without contrast injection while awaiting the RT-PCR test result. Eighty percent (80%) of patients had lesions characteristic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia on chest CT. The reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) test was later positive in 33 patients (94.28%) and negative in 2 (5.71%)., Conclusion: it is noted from this study that chest computed tomography is a critical tool in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Its systematization in all patients suspected in our dispute, would facilitate diagnosis while waiting for confirmation by RT-PCR and would limit the loss of cases.

N2  - This study assessed the behavioral outcomes of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing protocols and their influences on mental health. An online survey hosted by Survey Monkey was utilized to collect data from residents of three Ghanaian cities of Accra, Kumasi and Tamale. A total of 621 surveys were analyzed, with a sensitivity analysis utilized to select covariates for the regression model. The average age of participants was about 36 years. Findings indicate that reduced physical activity time and a change in sexual activity and smoking frequency are some short-term changes in behavior resulting from social isolation during the lockdown. An increase in sedentary behavior had a negative influence on mental health. For the most part, changes in behaviors in the short-term were associated with lower mental health scores. The study implied that COVID-19 social distancing measures should be implemented alongside public education for discouraging unhealthy changes in behaviors.

T1  - Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an Asia-Pacific perspective.
A1  - Asia Pacific COPD Roundtable Group
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem and its prevalence and mortality are increasing throughout the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. To arrest these worldwide trends, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Expert Panel's global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD was published in 2001. Based on recently published clinical trials, the GOLD statement was updated in 2003. The Asia-Pacific COPD Roundtable Group, a taskforce of expert respirologists from the Asia-Pacific region, has recently formulated a consensus statement on implementation of the GOLD strategy for COPD in the Asia-Pacific region. The key issues identified by the COPD Roundtable Group for comment are: (i) where there is no access to spirometry, diagnosis of COPD could be suspected on the basis of history, symptoms and physical signs; (ii) inhaled bronchodilators are the preferred regular treatment for COPD in the region, but oral bronchodilators may be considered if the cost of inhaled bronchodilators is a barrier to treatment; (iii) the use of a Metered Dose Inhaler with spacer in place of a nebulizer is recommended in the treatment of acute airflow obstruction in patients with COPD; (iv) influenza vaccination is recommended for all patients with COPD in communities where there is a high likelihood of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; and (v) simplified pulmonary rehabilitation programmes should be established in areas where comprehensive programmes are unavailable. Physical exercise training and education on smoking cessation should be core elements of any rehabilitation program. In summary, the COPD Roundtable Group supports implementation of the GOLD strategy for the diagnosis, management and prevention of COPD in the Asia-Pacific region, subject to the additions and modifications to the guidelines suggested above.

N2  - The use of antiretroviral therapy for people with HIV (PWH) has improved life expectancy. However, PWH now lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV infection. Unfortunately, PWH smoke at higher rates and have more difficulty maintaining abstinence than the general population, compounding their risk for chronic disease. In this Commentary, we describe a United States National Cancer Institute-led initiative to address the relative lack of research focused on developing, testing, and implementing smoking cessation interventions for PWH. This initiative supports seven clinical trials designed to systematically test and/or develop and test adaptations of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions for PWH (eg, combination of behavioral and pharmacological). We summarize each project, including setting/recruitment sites, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions being tested, and outcomes. This initiative provides critical opportunities for collaboration and data harmonization across projects. The knowledge gained will inform strategies to assist PWH to promote and maintain abstinence, and ensure that these efforts are adaptable and scalable, thereby addressing one of the major threats to the health of PWH. Reducing smoking behavior may be particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic given that smokers who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be at risk for more severe disease., IMPLICATIONS: This Commentary describes a National Cancer Institute-led initiative to advance the science and practice of treating tobacco use among PWH, which is now responsible for more life years lost than HIV. We describe the scope of the problem, the objectives of the initiative, and a summary of the seven funded studies. Harmonization of data across projects will provide information related to treatment mediators and moderators that was not previously possible. Stakeholders interested in tobacco cessation, including researchers, clinicians and public health officials, should be aware of this initiative and the evidence-base it will generate to advance tobacco treatment among this high-risk population.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous and growing burden on the population and health infrastructure, warranting innovative ways to mitigate risk of contracting and developing severe forms of this disease. A growing body of literature raises the issue of vitamin C and vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19., Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies., Method: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics., Results: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61 years, range 20-94), there were 11 survivors.Serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients.Older age and low vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample. Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not., Conclusion: Our pilot study found low serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19. These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum vitamin C and vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral vitamin C and vitamin D replacement.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The objective of the study is 2-fold. First, it estimates the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID19) flattening curve using Panel Random Coefficient Model. This allows each country to have its trajectory while allowing for random error effects to transfer across countries. Second, it calculates the expected number of days to reach the flattening point of COVID19 curve and estimate the empirical effectiveness of government policies around the world using Poisson regression. This study avails global COVID19 incidence data for 190 countries between January 22, 2020 and May 11, 2020. In the absence of a vaccine or of more appropriate treatment options, non-pharmaceutical approaches must be used to control the spread of the COVID19. This study proposed that the contact tracing, stay at home restrictions and international movement restrictions are most effective in controlling the spread and flattening the COIVD19 curve. At the same time, habits that hurt the immune system like smoking have a negative effect on the flattening of the curve. The government should integrate these policies in their lockdown plan to make it smart lockdown. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Human rhinovirus (HRV) accounts for a significant portion of common-cold illness, with the peak incidence being in the early fall. Three hundred forty-six adults who had self-diagnosed colds of 48 h or less were enrolled in a study during September and October 1994 to determine the frequency and clinical course of HRV infections. Nasal wash specimens for viral culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for HRV RNA and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E RNA detection were collected on enrollment, and participants recorded their symptoms twice daily for 14 days. Middle ear pressure (MEP) was measured with a digital tympanometer on days 1 and 7. Picornaviruses (224 HRV and 7 enterovirus isolates) were detected by culture in 67% (231 of 346) of the subjects. Among 114 samples negative by culture, HRV was detected by RT-PCR in 52 (46%) for an overall picornavirus infection rate of 82% (283 of 346 subjects). Among the remaining 62 negative samples, human coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 5 patients, so that 288 (83%) of patients had documented viral infection. The first symptom noticed most often was sore throat (40%) in HRV culture- or PCR-positive patients and stuffy nose in HRV-negative patients (27%). No differences in symptom scores over time or in the presence of individual symptoms were noted between groups. The median duration of the cold episodes was 11 days in HRV culture-positive patients, 9.5 days in HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 11.5 days in HRV-negative patients. On enrollment, abnormal MEPs ( or = +100 mm of H2O) were found for 21% of HRV culture-positive patients, 14% of HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 10% of HRV-negative patients. No important differences in the clinical course of HRV culture-positive, HRV culture-negative and RT-PCR-positive, or HRV-negative colds were found. These results represent the highest frequency of virologically confirmed natural colds to date and document the importance of rhinoviruses as the cause of colds during fall months.

T1  - Cerebrovascular and Neurological Dysfunction under the Threat of COVID-19: Is There a Comorbid Role for Smoking and Vaping?.
A1  - Archie, Sabrina Rahman

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The recently discovered novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus), has brought the whole world to standstill with critical challenges, affecting both health and economic sectors worldwide. Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers., SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London., DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data., PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders., RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group., CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a particularly relevant threat to mentally ill patients, and it constitutes a new challenge for health care providers. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any embracing published review about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic literature review. A search in the PubMed database was performed, with the terms 'psychotropic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'psychiatry' and 'pandemic'. Consensus and clinical guidelines about psychotropic drugs and COVID-19 approach, published by scientific societies, governmental entities and drug regulatory agencies were included., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We present the recommendations about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use., CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19. The regular treatment of mentally ill patients with COVID-19 presents increased complexity.

T1  - The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway alleviates acute lung injury.
A1  - Andersson, Ulf
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The ubiquiotous nuclear protein HMGB1 is extracellularly released by dying cells or activated innate immunity cells to promote inflammation. Extracellular HMGB1 plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury of infectious as well as sterile origin including hyperoxia. Excessive amounts of systemic HMGB1 and HMGB1-partner molecule complexes can be retained in the pulmonary circulation indicated by a substantial reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. The cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanism ameliorates pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting HMGB1 release and HMGB1 receptor expression. This comprehension was recently reinforced by results reported in Molecular Medicine by Sitapara and coworkers demonstrating that administration of an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist attenuated hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury by alleviating the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways and the circulation. Activating the cholinergic antiinflammatory path might be considered to alleviate severe COVID-19 with or without concurrent oxygen-induced lung injury.

N2  - A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products >6 months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias. On examination, he was ill appearing and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity. As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment of this patient early in the era of coronavirus disease 2019.

N2  - The effect of air-borne nanoparticles (NPs) on human health is an active area of research, with clinical relevance evidenced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. As in vitro models for such studies, lung-on-a-chip (LOAC) devices can represent key physical and physiological aspects of alveolar tissues. However, widespread adoption of the LOAC device for NP testing has been hampered by low intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory reproducibility. To complement ongoing experimental work, we carried out finite-element simulations of the deposition of NPs on the epithelial layer of a well-established LOAC design. We solved the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow in a three-dimensional domain and studied the particle transport using Eulerian advection-diffusion for fine NPs and Lagrangian particle tracking for coarse NPs. Using Langmuir and Frumkin kinetics for surface adsorption and desorption, we investigated NP adsorption under different exercise and breath-holding patterns. Conditions mimicking physical exercise, through changes in air-flow volume and breathing frequency, enhance particle deposition. Puff profiles typical of smoking, with breath-holding between inhalation and exhalation, also increase particle deposition per breathing cycle. Lagrangian particle tracking shows Brownian motion and gravitational settling to be two key factors, which may cooperate or compete with each other for different particle sizes. Comparisons are made with experimental data where possible and they show qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement. These results suggest that computer simulations can potentially inform and accelerate the design and application of LOAC devices for analyzing particulate- and microbe-alveolar interactions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Social determinants and health inequalities have a huge impact on health of populations. It is important to study their role in the management of the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in cities, as certain variables like the number of tests and the access to health system cannot be assumed as equal. The aim of this work was to determine the relation of social determinants in the incidence of Covid-19 in the city of Barcelona., METHODS: An observational retrospective ecological study was performed, with the neighbourhood as the population unit, based on data of cumulative incidence published at May 14th, 2020 by the Public Health Agency of Barcelona. Covid-19 incidence disparities depending on the income of the neighbourhoods, the Pearson linear correlation of the variables selected (age, sex, net density, immigrants, comorbidities, smokers, Body Mass Index [BMI] and Available Income per Family Index [AIFI]) with the incidence and the correlation with a multivariant Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were estimated., RESULTS: It was found that neighbourhoods belonging to the lowest quintile of income had a 42% more incidence than those belonging to the highest quintile: 942 cases per 100,000 inhabitants versus 545 per 100,000 inhabitants of the highest quintile. The Pearson correlation was statistically significative between the incidence of Covid-19 and the percentage of population over 75 (r=0.487), the percentage of immigration of the neighbourhood and the origin of the immigrants (r=-0.257), the AIFI (r=-0.462), the percentage of smokers (r=0.243) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (r=0.483). The GLM showed that the most correlated variables with the incidence are the percentage of people over 75 (Z-score=0.258), the percentage of people from Maghreb (Z-score=-0.206) and Latin America (Z-score=0.19) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (Z-score=0.334). The results of the GLM were significative., CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants are correlated with the modification of the incidence of Covid-19 in the neighbourhoods of Barcelona, with special relevance of the prevalence of BMI over 25 and the percentage of immigrants and its origin.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the mortality risk of patients with emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and COVID-19 during the pandemic., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two cohorts of consecutive patients with ELVO admitted to a quaternary hospital from March 1 to April 17, 2020. We abstracted data from electronic health records on baseline, biomarker profiles, key time points, quality measures and radiographic data., RESULTS: Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke, 36 had ELVO. Patients with COVID-19 and ELVO had a higher risk of mortality during the pandemic versus patients without COVID-19 (OR 16.63, p = 0.004). An age-based sub-analysis showed in-hospital mortality in 60% of COVID-19 positive patients between 61-70 years-old, 66.7% in between 51-60 years-old, 50% in between 41-50 years-old and 33.3% in between 31-40 years old. Patients that presented with pulmonary symptoms at time of stroke presentation had 71.4% mortality rate. 27.3% of COVID-19 patients presenting with ELVO had a good outcome at discharge (mRS 0-2). Patients with a history of cigarette smoking (p = 0.003), elevated d-dimer (p = 0.007), failure to recanalize (p = 0.007), and elevated ferritin levels (p = 0.006) had an increased risk of mortality., CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 and ELVO had a significantly higher risk for mortality compared to COVID-19 negative patients with ELVO. A small percentage of COVID-19 ELVO patients had good outcomes. Age greater than 60 and pulmonary symptoms at presentation have higher risk for mortality. Other risk factors for mortality were a history of cigarette smoking, elevated, failure to recanalize, elevated d-dimer and ferritin levels.

N2  - Introduction: Substance use disorder has been frequently reported to increase the risk of infectious diseases, which might be owing to the sharing of contaminated inhalation, smoking, vaping, or injection equipment. Aim: This review analyzes the recent literature with the aim to put in light the possible relationship between the abuse of different substances (Tobacco, opioid, and Alcohol) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Tobacco: Multiple studies confirmed that cigarette smoking affects the respiratory system by increasing the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, which have a significant association with COVID-19 infection rate and disease severity. Opioid: Studies conducted regarding the association of opioid use disorder (OUD) and COVID-19 infection severity are limited; however, opioids can lead to both respiratory depression and kidney injuries, causing poor prognosis for those with COVID-19 infections. Alcohol: People with alcohol use disorders are at risk of developing acute lung injury and severe COVID-19 infection. Alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has two possible scenarios: either increased or decreased based on situations. Conclusion:  SUD has been frequently reported to have a positive relationship with COVID-19 severity Further studies are needed to understand the effects of opioids and alcohol abuse on COVID-19.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a remarkably high transmissibility potential and sometimes invades the central nervous system (CNS). The study of the involvement of the nervous system in the pathogenesis of the disease is especially interesting. Currently, there are only three main theories about it: direct neuroinvasion; blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing and nicotinic hypothesis. Because of the rapid expansion of a virus that until now was unknown, it is necessary to know the mechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) generates the disease. The study of the involvement of the nervous system in the pathogenesis of the disease is especially interesting, since it is the least studied question with more innovative theories that could explain not only neurological complications, but also the primary infection and the involvement of the various organs and systems.

N2  - Risk factors for primary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) illness in humans are incompletely understood. We identified all primary MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014 by excluding those with history of exposure to other cases of MERS-CoV or acute respiratory illness of unknown cause or exposure to healthcare settings within 14 days before illness onset. Using a case-control design, we assessed differences in underlying medical conditions and environmental exposures among primary case-patients and 2-4 controls matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Using multivariable analysis, we found that direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, as well as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking, were each independently associated with MERS-CoV illness. Further investigation is needed to better understand animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers., METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI)., RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%., CONCLUSION: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.

N2  - Background: In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in this unique patient population., Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were included. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes (admission to intensive care and/or mortality)., Findings: Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (46.3%), of whom 35 later developed symptoms, and 59.7% had no signs of infection. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - recent studies have provided novel evidence regarding the effect of nicotine agonists on the prevention or modulation of cytokines storm and reduction of infection. In this study we tried to attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective of nicotine agonists in this manner and we describe one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). The analysis of the proposed mechanism goes beyond the physiological consequences of a way to design new strategies to provide anti-inflammatory drugs. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - During the pandemic, the world's media have publicized preliminary findings suggesting that tobacco use is protective against COVID-19. An ad hoc multidisciplinary group was created to address the major public health implications of this messaging. Key messages of this commentary are as follows: 1) The COVID-19 crisis may increase tobacco consumption and decrease access to healthcare. As a result, smoking-related morbidity and mortality could increase in the coming months and years; 2) Smoking and tobacco-related diseases are prognostic factors for severe COVID-19; and 3) In theory, smokers may be at lower risk of COVID-19 infection because of having fewer social contacts. In conclusion, tobacco control is a greater challenge than ever in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public decision-makers must be vigilant in ensuring that public health practices are consistent and compliant with the principles of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In addition, researchers and the media have a responsibility to be cautious in communicating preliminary results that may promote non-evidence-based research, self-destructive individual behaviours, and commercial agendas.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To confirm whether a relationship exists between male sex and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality and whether this relationship is age dependent., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the COVID-19 Research Network, a multinational database using the TriNetX network, to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The main end point of the study was all-cause mortality., RESULTS: A total of 14,712 patients were included, of whom 6387 (43%) were men. Men were older (mean age, 55.0+/-17.7 years vs 51.1+/-17.9 years; P<.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, nicotine dependence, and heart failure but a lower prevalence of obesity. Before propensity score matching (PSM), all-cause mortality rate was 8.8% in men and 4.3% in women (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.46; P<.001) at a median follow-up duration of 34 and 32 days, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival was significantly lower in men than in women (73% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). After PSM, all-cause mortality remained significantly higher in men than in women (8.13% vs 4.60%; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.11; P<.001). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in men than in women (74% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). The cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in propensity score-matched men than in women after excluding patients younger than 50 years and those who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker medications on admission., CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 infection, men had a significantly higher mortality than did women, and this difference was not completely explained by the higher prevalence of comorbidities in men.

T1  - Renin-angiotensin system at the heart of COVID-19 pandemic.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.

N2  - The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic. One week after initial symptoms develop, a subset of patients progresses to severe disease, with high mortality and limited treatment options. To design novel interventions aimed at preventing spread of the virus and reducing progression to severe disease, detailed knowledge of the cell types and regulating factors driving cellular entry is urgently needed. Here we assess the expression patterns in genes required for COVID-19 entry into cells and replication, and their regulation by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, throughout the respiratory tract using samples collected from the upper (nasal) and lower airways (bronchi). Matched samples from the upper and lower airways show a clear increased expression of these genes in the nose compared to the bronchi and parenchyma. Cellular deconvolution indicates a clear association of these genes with the proportion of secretory epithelial cells. Smoking status was found to increase the majority of COVID-19 related genes including ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but only in the lower airways, which was associated with a significant increase in the predicted proportion of goblet cells in bronchial samples of current smokers. Both acute and second hand smoke were found to increase ACE2 expression in the bronchus. Inhaled corticosteroids decrease ACE2 expression in the lower airways. No significant effect of genetics on ACE2 expression was observed, but a strong association of DNA- methylation with ACE2 and TMPRSS2- mRNA expression was identified in the bronchus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Since the first COVID-19 patient in Saudi Arabia (March, 2020) more than 338,539 cases and approximately 4996 dead were reported. We present the main characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients that were admitted in the largest Ministry of Health Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Saudi Arabia., METHODS: This retrospective study, analyzed routine epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data of COVID-19 critically ill patients in King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between March 20, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays performed on nasopharyngeal swabs in all enrolled cases. Outcome measures such as 28-days mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay were analyzed., RESULTS: Three-hundred-and-fifty-two critically ill COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Patients had a mean age of 50.63 +/- 13.3 years, 87.2% were males, and 49.4% were active smokers. Upon ICU admission, 56.8% of patients were mechanically ventilated with peripheral oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio of 158 +/- 32. No co-infections with other endemic viruses were observed. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 16 (IQR: 8-28) days; ICU length of stay was 18 (IQR: 9-29) days, and 28-day mortality was 32.1%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that old age [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.15, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.03-1.21], active smoking [OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.51-3.66], pulmonary embolism [OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 2.65-3.36), decreased SpO2/FiO2 ratio [OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.97], and increased lactate [OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.4-4.9], and D-dimers [OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.57-3.12] were mortality predictors., CONCLUSION: Old age, active smoking, pulmonary embolism, decreased SpO2/FiO2 ratio, and increased lactate and D-dimers were predictors of 28-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

T1  - The Structure and the Outcome of Telephone-Based Cardiac Consultations During Lockdown: A Lesson From COVID-19.
A1  - Alhadramy, Osama M Sr
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background In response to COVID-19, Saudi Arabia as many countries, implemented "lockdown" to contain the epidemic. This resulted in suspension of all outpatient services. The reliability of the alternative telecommunication cardiac services during that time is not well studied. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to describe the structure of the telephone-based cardiac consultation (TBCC) and to explore its outcome. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that has a prospective follow up on patients who underwent medical intervention. During the period of lockdown, Alre'aiah health care society in Almadinah Almunawwarah, Saudi Arabia, provided a community health service. This was achieved by announcing telephone numbers for consultations in most specialties. This study includes all TBCC of a single cardiologist. Detailed demographic data, medical, social and drug histories of the patients were collected in charts. Individuals were requested to measure blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at the time of TBCC. Accordingly, cardiovascular assessment and appropriate intervention were executed. Patients who needed medical intervention were followed up in one week. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results From 01 April till 15 June 2020, a total of 168 individuals sought TBCC. Their median age was 51.5 +/- 12.7 years, and (57.1%) were females. Healthy individuals constituted (33.9%), and (59.9%) were non-smokers. The most common reported medical illnesses were hypertension (27.3%), diabetes (23.8%), heart failure (16.1%), and coronary artery disease (14.9%). Palpitations were encountered by 58 patients. None of them had high-risk features or cardiac disease. Stress, excessive smoking, and caffeine intake were thought to be responsible for palpitations in 52 individuals who were reassured and educated, and newly diagnosed hypertension was established prospectively in eight patients and they were started on medications. Chest pain was reported by 51 individuals. The diagnosis of typical angina was made in nine patients and they were instructed to seek emergency care. Atypical angina pain was established in 10 cases who were advised to seek formal consultation once lockdown ends. Reassurance was achieved in 32 individuals who had features of non-angina pain. Uncontrolled hypertension was reported by 32 patients. Blood pressure control was achieved prospectively in 70% of these patients who followed up by adjusting their antihypertensive drugs. Twenty-seven patients with heart failure complained of worsening shortness of breath. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 1-2 was reported by 21 patients, and they were managed by doubling diuretic dose, 19 of them followed back and reported significant improvement. NYHA class 3-4 was established in 6 patients and they were instructed to seek emergency care. Conclusions When standard face-to-face cardiac consultations are compromised, a structured TBCC is considered feasible, seems effective, and promising alternative method of delivering the utmost cardiac care to the community. When conducted properly, it is useful to triage patients. Copyright © 2020, Alhadramy et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) is limited in the Arab region. This study aims to fill this gap., METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55 years; 68.3% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7%), DM (68.3%), hypertension (42.6%) and obesity (42.2%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5% versus 12.3%; p = 0.04) and lower survival time (p = 0.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.7-5.3); p < 0.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4-8.3); p = 0.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0-17.2); p < 0.001], beta-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0-2.9); p = 0.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1-3.3); p = 0.02], creatinine > 90 micromol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3-3.5); p = 0.004] and 25(OH)D < 12.5 nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7-28.2); p = 0.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose >= 11.1 mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.2); p = 0.04], as well as smoking, beta-blocker use, neutrophil > 7.5, creatinine > 90 micromol/l and alanine aminotransferase > 65U/l., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, beta-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced as a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several scientists have focused on the low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings led to our hypothesis that the Nicotinic Cholinergic System (NCS) plays a crucial role in the manifestation of COVID-19 and its severe symptoms. Molecular modeling revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein might bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) through a cryptic epitope homologous to snake toxins, substrates well documented and known for their affinity to the nAChRs. This binding model could provide logical explanations for the acute inflammatory disorder in patients with COVID-19, which may be linked to severe dysregulation of NCS. In this study, we present a series of complexes with cholinergic agonists that can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein from binding to nAChRs, avoiding dysregulation of the NCS and moderating the symptoms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. If our hypothesis is verified by in vitro and in vivo studies, repurposing agents currently approved for smoking cessation and neurological conditions could provide the scientific community with a therapeutic option in severe COVID-19.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), global health problem and it is a threat to health and the development of countries. Currently, the number of people with COVID-19 as well as the resulting death toll is rising sharply worldwide. People with underlying diseases may be at greater risk., AIM: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the chronic non-communicable diseases in the epidemic (COVID-19): Investigation of risk factors, control and care., METERIALS AND METHODS: To access the articles, including international databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase were searched using the keywords of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), chronic, risk factors, prevention and control, self-efficacy and self-care and their various combinations using AND/OR operators. No language restrictions were applied to the search process., RESULTS: Based on the evidence, NCDs, exacerbate the negative consequences of COVID-19. according to the results of this study, Among the patients admitted with COVID-19, The most common underlying diseases, were in these people, include, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Obesity may be considered as a potential COVID-19 risk factor., CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle, nutrition, and medical interventions are important for the early prevention of NCDs, having the tools and resources to use information more effectively is more important One of the determining and effective factors in maintaining health and preventing the aggravation of signs and symptoms of the disease COVID-19, especially in chronic diseases, is to perform self-care behaviors.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had major negative health, psychological, social and economic repercussions for individuals, families, communities, countries and for humanity in general. The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications. This review reports current knowledge on the relationship between COVID-19 and SRAA. Copyright: © 2020 Permanyer.

T1  - The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE-2, is expressed on many different cell types: implications for ACE-inhibitor- and angiotensin II receptor blocker-based cardiovascular therapies.
T3  - [Comment in: Intern Emerg Med. 2020 Nov;15(8):1581-1582; PMID: 32564289 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564289]]

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a spike protein allowing viral binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which acts as a viral receptor and is expressed on the surface of several pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cell types, including cardiac, renal, intestinal and endothelial cells. There is evidence that also endothelial cells are infected by SARS-COV-2, with subsequent occurrence of systemic vasculitis, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Those effects, together with the "cytokine storm" are involved in a worse prognosis. In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. In in vivo studies, ACE-Is and ARBs seem to paradoxically increase ACE-2 expression, which could favour SARS-CoV-2 infection of host's cells and tissues. By contrast, in patients treated with ACE-Is and ARBs, ACE-2 shows a downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels in kidney and cardiac tissues. Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. As detected in China and as the Italian epidemiological situation confirms, the most prevalent comorbidities in deceased patients with COVID-19 are hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is. Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans. Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower. Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme. Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies. We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course? Are such effects dangerous, neutral or even useful in older, COVID-19-affected patients? Do they act on multiple cell types? Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes. At present, insufficient detailed data from trials have been made available.

N2  - The severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a huge social and health challenge worldwide. Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, older age, and other co-infections. Other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking are common comorbidities worldwide. Previous investigations have identified among COVID-19 patients smokers and COPD patients, but recent investigations have questioned the higher risk among these populations. Nevertheless, previous reports failed to isolate smokers and COPD patients without other comorbidities. We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID-19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge. Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID-19-associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to non-smokers and former smokers. Our results demonstrated that smoking and COPD are risk factors for severe COVID-19 with possible implications for the ongoing pandemic.

N2  - Loss of smell and taste are common complaints in patients with the COVID-19 disease. These symptoms may present alone or with other symptoms. It is of utmost importance to know their rates of occurrence for better controlling of the infection. The aim of the study was to detect the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in individuals with COVID-19 in Al-Wajbah Primary Health Center, Doha, Qatar. This retrospective study was conducted at Al-Wajbah Primary Health Center, Doha, Qatar. The study covered the two-month period -May and June 2020. The proven cases of COVID-19 by real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) were enrolled in the study. Data regarding the age, gender, symptomatology including anosmia and ageusia, history of recent travel, smoking, past history of nasal and paranasal diseases (NPND), and severity of the disease were taken from the patients' records. IBM- SPSS version 22 statistical software was used for the analysis of the data. Out of 141, 35 (24.82%) subject presented with anosmia, ageusia or both. Most of the patients were from age group > 30 year (n = 104, 73.76%) with nearly equal gender. The majority of the individuals were without history of recent travel (92.2%) and smoking (80.14%). Three-quarters of the patients were asymptomatic, and 51.06% with a past history of NPND. The male sex, history of recent travel, smoking, and severe course of the disease were positive, highly significant association with anosmia or ageusia. All patients returned to their normal smell and taste sensations within a mean duration of 6.89 days. Loss of taste and smell were common symptomatology of COVID-19 disease. The males, recent travel, smoking, and severe course of the disease were risk factors of the anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 cases. Copyright © Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance, which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene, which is involved in the regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow the completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a dataset using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs, which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Moreover, ACE2 expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue can be regulated through changes in diet. Validation of the in silico data revealed a higher expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and SREBP1 in vitro in lung epithelial cells from obese subjects compared to non-obese subjects. To our knowledge this is the first study to show upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in obesity. In silico and in vitro results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The impact of countries' bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policies on the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a curiosity. In this study, the relationship between BCG vaccination status and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors affecting disease severity were investigated., METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2020 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity in a nasopharyngeal sample and pulmonary infiltrates in computed chest tomography, in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Socio-demographic features, body mass index, smoking status, concomitant diseases, income rates and BCG vaccination status of subjects were analyzed., RESULT: The study population comprised 123 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia [mean age = 49.7 years, standard deviation = 13.3 years; 82 (66.7%) male]. While the rate of cases vaccinated with BCG is lower (68.5 versus 88.2%, P = 0.026), mean age (54.0 +/- 11.5 years versus 38.3 +/- 10.7 years; P < 0.001), diabetes (32.6 versus 5.9%, P = 0.002) and low income (84.3 versus 52.9%, P < 0.001) are higher in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease. According to multivariate analysis increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.119; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.062-1.178, P < 0.001] and low income (OR = 3.209; 95% CI = 1.008-10.222, P = 0.049) are associated with severe disease in COVID-19 pneumonia., CONCLUSION: This study reveals that BCG vaccination is not associated with disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia. Age and low income are the main determinants of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Copyright © 2020 British Society for Immunology.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) group of viruses. To date, April 25, 2020, more than 2.4 million humans are infected and more than a hundred thousand deaths have been reported from more than 200 countries from COVID-19. There is no evidence-based treatment for the infection and prevention of transmission using social distancing, isolation and hygiene measures is widely recommended. Tobacco smoking is rampant in communities around the globe and the addiction to tobacco results in deaths of more than 8 million individuals each year. As COVID-19 transmits through salivary droplets and causes severe lung pneumonia, tobacco smokers are also at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to poor lung function, cross-infection and susceptible hygiene habits. Smoking tobacco (cigarette, e-cigarettes or waterpipe) produces exhaled smoke, coughing or sneezing, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the surroundings and contaminating surfaces. Therefore, smoking tobacco is a possible mode of transmission for the virus for both active and passive smokers. Smoking should be considered a risk factor for the disease transmission until further availability of evidence and measures to limit its direct and indirect effects should be implemented within the community.

N2  - The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey comprised of 1222 participants was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% took medicines, 57.6% took herbal foods/products, and 11.2% took both medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measure against Covid-19. Arsenicum album, vitamin supplements, and zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal foods/products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, paracetamol, antihistamines, antibiotics, and mineral (zinc and calcium) supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of certain drugs was identified.

N2  - The new coronavirus, COVID-19, spread quickly and causes the death for thousands of people, and a major freeze for the economy and people activities worldwide. This study made statistical analysis for the influences of the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and air pollution, which may aid in spreading this virus very fast. The study also investigated statistically the impact of people customs such as smoking, drinking wine, and eating pig meat on the number of deaths among infected people. The study depicted reasons for spreading it in some places much more than others over the world. A statistical software SPSS was adopted to find a correlation among the different variables affecting the virus spread. The results exhibited a significant relationship between the suggested conditions and the virus spread. The study introduced two regression equations for expecting infected people and deaths based on the examined conditions for any region. Copyright © Islamic Azad University (IAU) 2020.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is most frequently associated with a mild presentation of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Typical radiographic findings of COVID-19 are bilateral ground-glass opacities on computed tomography (CT) scans. However, there have been instances of pneumothorax, giant bulla, and pneumomediastinum, mainly in elderly COVID-19 patients and predominately occurring at least one week after symptom onset. Here, we report a case where a healthy, young Hispanic man presented with three days of fever, cough, and dyspnea. On admission to the emergency department, he was found to have bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium requiring bilateral chest tubes. The patient had no predisposing risk factors for pneumothorax, such as a history of trauma, smoking, past intubations, asthma, high pressure oxygen delivery, or a history of prior pneumothorax. The only positive diagnostic test was a SARS-CoV-2 test by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. This case highlights the potential atypical presentation of a COVID-19 infection and is the first reported case, to our knowledge, that features bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium as a probable rare presentation of COVID-19.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first time reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and thereafter quickly spread across the globe. Till September 19, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 216 countries and territories. Severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 cause extreme increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that may lead to multi-organ damage and respiratory failure. Currently, no specific treatment and authorized vaccines are available for its treatment. Renin angiotensin system holds a promising role in human physiological system specifically in regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Renin angiotensin system by utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for its cellular entry. This interaction hampers the protective action of ACE2 in the cells and causes injuries to organs due to persistent angiotensin II (Ang-II) level. Patients with certain comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are under the high risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Moreover, evidence obtained from several reports also suggests higher susceptibility of male patients for COVID-19 mortality and other acute viral infections compared to females. Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemiological data also indicate a gender-based preference in disease consequences. The current review addresses the possible mechanisms responsible for higher COVID-19 mortality among male patients. The major underlying aspects that was looked into includes smoking, genetic factors, and the impact of reproductive hormones on immune systems and inflammatory responses. Detailed investigations of this gender disparity could provide insight into the development of patient tailored therapeutic approach which would be helpful in improving the poor outcomes of COVID-19.

Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association., METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020., RESULTS: 1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, p<0.001), HIV infection (11% vs 5%,p<0.001), cancer (11% vs 6%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15% vs 8%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (15% vs 9%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11% vs 8%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005). Univariate Cox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed that among smokers only current smokers had higher risk of death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p<0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox model for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum lactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were associated with overall improved survival., CONCLUSION: In our large single-centre retrospective database of patients hospitalised with COVID-19, smoking was associated with development of critical illness and higher likelihood of death.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the occurrence of symptoms resembling those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a large nonhospitalized population at the peak of the epidemic in Italy is of paramount importance; however, data are currently scarce., OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the association of self-reported symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results in nonhospitalized individuals and to estimate the occurrence of symptoms associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a larger nontested population., METHODS: EPICOVID19 is a self-administered cross-sectional voluntary web-based survey of adults throughout Italy who completed an anonymous questionnaire in the period of April 13 to 21, 2020. The associations between symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and NPS results were calculated as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs by multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education, smoking habits, and number of comorbidities. Thereafter, for each symptom and for combinations of the symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and areas under the curve (AUCs) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the occurrence of COVID-19-like infection in the nontested population., RESULTS: A total of 171,310 people responded to the survey, of whom 102,543 (59.9%) were women; mean age 47.4 years. Out of the 4785 respondents with known NPS test results, 4392 were not hospitalized. Among the 4392 nonhospitalized respondents, those with positive NPS tests (856, 19.5%) most frequently reported myalgia (527, 61.6%), olfactory and taste disorders (507, 59.2%), cough (466, 54.4%), and fever (444, 51.9%), whereas 7.7% were asymptomatic. Multiple regression analysis showed that olfactory and taste disorders (aOR 10.3, 95% CI 8.4-12.7), fever (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.1), myalgia (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and cough (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with NPS positivity. Having two to four of these symptoms increased the aOR from 7.4 (95% CI 5.6-9.7) to 35.5 (95% CI 24.6-52.2). The combination of the four symptoms showed an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI 0.795-0.825) in classifying positive NPS test results and then was applied to the nonhospitalized and nontested sample (n=165,782). We found that 7739 to 20,103 of these 165,782 respondents (4.4% to 12.1%) had experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that self-reported symptoms are reliable indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pandemic context. A nonnegligible number of symptomatic respondents (up to 12.1%) were undiagnosed and potentially contributed to the spread of the infection., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04471701; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04471701.

N2  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 morbidity and mortality reports in the U.S. have not included findings specific to young adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a list of conditions and associated behaviors, including smoking, conferring vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness regardless of age. This study examines young adults' medical vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness, focusing on smoking-related behavior., METHODS: A young adult subsample (aged 18-25 years) was developed from the National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative data set, pooling years 2016-2018. The medical vulnerability measure (yes vs. no) was developed, guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention medical indicators. The estimates of medical vulnerability were developed for the full sample, the nonsmoking sample, and the individual risk indicators. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine differences by sex, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance., RESULTS: Medical vulnerability was 32% for the full sample and half that (16%) for the nonsmoking sample. Patterns and significance of some subgroup differences differed between the full and the nonsmoking sample. Male vulnerability was (33%) higher than female (30%; 95% CI: .7-.9) in the full sample, but lower in nonsmokers: male (14%) versus female (19%; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7). The white subgroup had higher vulnerability than Hispanic and Asian subgroups in both samples-full sample: white (31%) versus Hispanic (24%; 95% CI: .6-.9) and Asian (18%; 95% CI: .4-.5); nonsmokers: white (17%) versus Hispanic (13%; 95% CI: .06-.9) and Asian (10%; 95% CI: .3-.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Notably, lower young adult medical vulnerability within nonsmokers versus the full sample underscores the importance of smoking prevention and mitigation.

N2  - The severe form of COVID-19 has significant sex disparities, with high fatalities commonly reported among males than females. The incidence of COVID-19 has also been higher in males compared with their female counterparts. This trend could be attributed to a better responsive and robust immune system in females. Cytokine storm is one of the pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19, and it occurs as a result of over-activation of immune cells leading to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Nevertheless, it is well modulated in females compared to their male counterparts. Severe inflammation in males is reported to facilitate progression of mild to severe COVID-19. The sex hormones, estrogens and androgens which exist in varying functional levels respectively in females and males are cited as the underlying cause for the differential immune response to COVID-19. Evidence abounds that estrogen modulate the immune system to protect females from severe inflammation and for that matter severe COVID-19. On the contrary, androgen has been implicated in over-activation of immune cells, cytokine storm and the attendant severe inflammation, which perhaps predispose males to severe COVID-19. In this review efforts are made to expand understanding and explain the possible roles of the immune system, the sex hormones and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) systems in male bias to severe COVID-19. Also, this review explores possible therapeutic avenues including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), estrogen-based therapy, and ACE inhibitors for consideration in the fight against COVID-19.

N2  - Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing public health crisis. Despite initial focus on the elderly population with comorbidities, it seems that large studies from the worst affected countries follow a sex-disaggregation pattern. Analysis of available data showed marked variations in reported cases between males and females among different countries with higher mortality in males. At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males. Keywords: COVID-19; gender; males; sex disaggregation; susceptibility.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive medical staff compared with those of public. Methods: A total of 108 COVID-19-positive medical staff patients were included in the study from March 23, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Patients were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personel. Results: Mean age of medical staff patients was 44.05+/-13.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with pneumonia. Fatality ratio among medical staff patients was 4.6%. Male gender with odds ratios (OR) of 7.771 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 0.837-72.195 and a history of chronic kidney disease of (OR=10.778, 95% CI: 1.503-77.287) were predictors of death among the medical staff group. Conclusion : The incidence of COVID-19 infection among medical staff is quite high, but the occurrence of extreme illness and death is significantly low compared with the general community. Training should be implemented for all hospital staff on infection prevention techniques. Reliable and quick access for testing medical personnel is essential to maintain health, safety, and availability of health care workers during this pandemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a detailed study of demographic, baseline comorbidities, clinical features, and outcome for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients., METHODS: A record-based case-series study conducted from March 23 to June 15, 2020 in King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, complications, and in-hospital outcome of COVID-19 patients collected with analysis of the clinical characteristics for survivors and deceased., RESULTS: A total of 768 patients were included. The mean age was 46.36+/-13.7 years and 76.7% were men. Approximately 96.3% reported more than one comorbidity; diabetes mellitus was the most frequent (46.4%). Fever (84.5%), cough (82.3%), and shortness of breath (79.8%) were the main presenting symptoms. During the follow-up, pneumonia reported in 68.6%, acute respiratory distress syndrome in 32.7%, septic shock in 20.7%, respiratory failure in 20.3%, and acute kidney injury in 19.3%. Approximately 45.8% of enrolled patients required intensive care unit admission. Lung disease (odd ratio [OR]=3.862 with 95% confident interval [CI] (2.455-6.074), obesity (OR=3.732, CI=2.511-5.546), smoking (OR=2.991, CI=2.072-4.317), chronic kidney disease (OR=2.296. CI=1.497-3.521), and diabetes mellitus (OR=2.291, CI=1.714-3.063) are predictors of ICU admission. Fatality ratio was 4.27%; therefore, men were more prevalent in dead group., CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 places a huge burden on healthcare facilities, particularly in patients with comorbidity. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who are obese and smokers with history of diabetes mellitus have a high risk of death.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2., OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN)., METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2., RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%., CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems.

N2  - Furin, a cleavage enzyme, is increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Its cleavage action is an essential activation step for the endothelial pathogenicity of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. This Furin-mediated endothelial tropism seems to underlie the multi-organ system involvement of COVID-19; which is a feature that was not recognized in the older versions of coronaviridae. Obese and diabetic patients, males, and the elderly, have increased serum levels of Furin, with its increased cellular activity; this might explain why these subgroups are at an increased risk of COVID-19 related complications and deaths. In contrast, smoking decreases cellular levels of Furin, this finding may be at the origin of the decreased severity of COVID-19 in smokers. Chinese herbal derived luteolin is suggested to be putative Furin inhibitor, with previous success against Dengue Fever. Additionally, Furin intracellular levels are largely dependent on concentration of intracellular ions, notably sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Consequently, the use of ion channel inhibitors, such as Calcium Channel blockers or Potassium Channel blockers, can prevent cellular transfection early in the course of the illness. Nicotine patches and Colchicine have also been suggested as potential therapies due to Furin mediated inhibition of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional, observational follow-up for 284 COVID-19 patients involving healthy patients, smokers, diabetics, and diabetic plus smokers recruited from May 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020. The clinical features, severity, duration, and outcome of the disease were analyzed., RESULTS: Of 284 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-80), and 33.80% were female. Common symptoms included fever (85.56%), shortness of breath (49.65%), cough (45.42%), and headache (40.86%). Patients with more than one comorbidity (diabetes and smoking) presented as severe-critical cases compared to healthy patients, diabetics, and smokers. Smokers presented with a lower rate of death in comparison to diabetic patients and diabetic + smoking, furthermore, smoking was less risky than diabetes. Although the mortality rate was high in patients with smokers compared to healthy patients (4.22%, the hazard ratio [HR], 1.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.542-1.100; p = .014), it was less than in diabetics (7.04%, HR 1.531, 95% CI: 1.668-1.337, p = .000), and diabetic plus smoker (10.00%, HR, 1.659; 95% CI, 1.763-1.510; p = .000)., CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities are closely related to the severity of COVID-19 disease progression and the higher mortality rate. Smokers presented as mild cases compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients, who presented as severe to critical cases. Although a higher death rate in smokers was seen compared with healthy patients, this was smaller when compared to diabetic and diabetic + smoking patients. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the sex difference in the prevalence of COVID-19 confirmed cases., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis., SETTING: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for related information. The authors developed a data extraction form on an Excel sheet and the following data from eligible studies were extracted: author, country, sample size, number of female patients and number of male patients. Using STATA V.14 for analysis, the authors pooled the overall prevalence of men and/or women using a random-effect meta-analysis model. The authors examined the heterogeneity in effect size using Q statistics and I2 statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was also checked., PARTICIPANTS: Studies on COVID-19 confirmed cases were included., INTERVENTION: Sex (male/female) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was considered., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 among men and women., RESULTS: A total of 57 studies with 221 195 participants were used in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among men was found to be 55.00 (51.43-56.58, I2=99.5%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed the findings were not dependent on a single study. Moreover, a funnel plot showed symmetrical distribution. Egger's regression test p value was not significant, which indicates absence of publication bias in both outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be higher in men than in women. The high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption contributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 among men. Additional studies on the discrepancies in severity and mortality rate due to COVID-19 among men and women and the associated factors are recommended.

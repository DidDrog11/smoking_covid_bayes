We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5\% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 \% (95\% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5\%, 95\%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those \&gt;65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3\% and 4.7-5.4\% respectively).

Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95\%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95\%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95\%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Health and key workers are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; it is not known, however, if this risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns. We aimed to investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline and with linked COVID-19 data to 31
              st
              August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions.
            
          
          
            Findings
            Of 235,685 participants (81·5\% neither health nor shift worker, 1·4\% health worker only, 16·9\% shift worker only, and 0·3\% both), there were 580 (0·25\%) cases of severe COVID-19. The risk of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2.32 [95\% CI: 1·33, 4·05]; shift workers (2·06 [1·72, 2·47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the risk severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Both health and shift work were independently associated with over twice the risk of severe COVID-19; the risk was over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.

            Research in context
            
              Evidence before this study
              The risk of developing severe COVID-19 is greater in occupational groups with higher levels of viral exposure, e.g. health and key workers. We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to December 8, 2020 for papers on shift work patterns, health work and incidence of COVID-19 using the keywords “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “shift work” “health worker”. Recent evidence suggests shift workers are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 but it is not clear if the risk is exacerbated in those who work shifts in healthcare.
            
            
              Added value of this study
              This study uses data from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of {\textgreater}500,000 adults aged 40-69 years with baseline assessments between March 2006 and July 2010. Participants’ occupation was categorised according to whether or not they were health workers and/or shift workers at baseline. Results showed that being a health worker, or working shifts, were similarly and independently associated with over twice the population level risk of severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was seven times higher in health workers with shift working patterns. The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in males and in minority ethnic groups, who are already at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In people over the age of retirement, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 associated with baseline health worker status was no longer apparent, suggesting the risk is likely explained by exposure to the virus. However, the elevated risk associated with baseline shift worker status persisted, albeit attenuated.
            
            
              Implications of all the available evidence
              Shift workers are at elevated risk of developing severe COVID-19. The persistence of an elevated risk in people who are now over retirement age, but had a shift worker status at baseline, suggests the risk may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus. Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for health care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive measures.},

            From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied 688 patients with arterial hypertension (254 deaths) to assess whether use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) prior to hospital admission affects mortality from Covid-19. Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (
            p
            =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures with no exposure to RASIs. We found both prior use of ACEIs and prior use of ARBs to be associated with a lower Covid-19 mortality, after adjusting for 32 medical history variables via propensity score matching. (

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objectives
            The epidemiology of post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is currently undefined. We quantified rates of organ-specific impairment following recovery from COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with those in a matched control group, and how the rate ratio (RR) varies by age, sex, and ethnicity.
          
          
            Design
            Observational, retrospective, matched cohort study.
          
          
            Setting
            NHS hospitals in England.
          
          
            Participants
            47,780 individuals (mean age 65 years, 55\% male) in hospital with COVID-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, matched to controls on demographic and clinical characteristics.
          
          
            Outcome measures
            Rates of hospital readmission, all-cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney and liver diseases until 30 September 2020.
          
          
            Results
            Mean follow-up time was 140 days for COVID-19 cases and 153 days for controls. 766 (95\% confidence interval: 753 to 779) readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 person-years were observed in COVID-19 cases, 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and 7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater, respectively, than in controls. Rates of respiratory, diabetes and cardiovascular events were also significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases, at 770 (758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132) and 126 (121 to 131) events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. RRs were greater for individuals aged {\textless}70 than ≥ 70 years, and in ethnic minority groups than the White population, with the biggest differences observed for respiratory disease: 10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for {\textless}70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for ≥ 70 years, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for Non-White versus 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for White.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Individuals discharged from hospital following COVID-19 face elevated rates of multi-organ dysfunction compared with background levels, and the increase in risk is neither confined to the elderly nor uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PCS require integrated rather than organ- or disease-specific approaches. Urgent research is required to establish risk factors for PCS.},

          Multiple studies have demonstrated the negative impact of cancer care delays during the COVID-19 pandemic, and transmission mitigation techniques are imperative for continued cancer care delivery. To gauge the effectiveness of these measures at the University of Pennsylvania, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and seroconversion in patients presenting to infusion centers for cancer-directed therapy between 5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6\%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0\% (95\%CI 0.0-4.1\%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient. These results suggest that cancer patients receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.},

          As essential personnel, United States farmworkers have continued working in-person throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We undertook prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody prevalence among farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley from 15 June to 30 November, 2020. Over this period, we observed 22.1\% (1514/6864) positivity for current SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid detection among farmworkers tested at federally-qualified migrant and community health clinics, as compared to 17.2\% (1255/7305) among other adults from the same communities (risk ratio, 1.29; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-1.37). In a nested study enrolling 1,115 farmworkers, prevalence of current infection was 27.7\% among farmworkers reporting ≥1 potential COVID-19 symptom, and 7.2\% among farmworkers without symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 4.17; 2.86-6.09). Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies increased from 10.5\% (6.0-18.4\%) between 16 July-31 August to 21.2\% (16.6-27.4\%) between 1-30 November. The high observed prevalence of infection among farmworkers underscores the need for vaccination and other preventive interventions.},

            Background
            Evidence on risk factors, incidence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant mothers and their babies has rapidly expanded but there is a lack of population level data to inform accurate incidence rates and unbiased descriptions of characteristics and outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2 in order to inform future clinical guidance and management.
          
          
            Methods and Findings
            
              We conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 1st March 2020 to 31
              st
              August 2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) across all 194 hospitals in the UK with a consultant-led maternity unit. Incidence was estimated using the latest national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63\% of which were symptomatic. Therefore, the estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95\% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95\% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, 95\% CI 1.39-2.48 and aOR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.53-2.29 respectively), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, 95\% CI 3.93-9.90, aOR 4.36, 95\% CI 3.19-5.95 and aOR 12.95, 95\% CI 4.93-34.01 respectively), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.32-2.54). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, 95\% CI 7.80-426.70) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, 95\% CI 1.97-3.42 and aOR 3.08, 95\% CI 1.99-4.77 respectively; asymptomatic aOR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.52-2.70 and aOR 1.84, 95\% 1.12-3.03 respectively). Iatrogenic preterm births were more common in women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (aOR 11.43, 95\% CI 5.07-25.75). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status but numbers were small. The limitations of this study include the restriction to women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2, who may by nature of their admission have been at greater risk of adverse outcome.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            We have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. The increased risks of cesarean and iatrogenic preterm birth provide clear evidence of the indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mothers and maternity care in high income settings. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and women with mild disease can be discharged to continue their pregnancy safely.},

            Context
            On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population.
          
          
            Objectives
            The aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening.
          
          
            Study Design
            Open uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study.
          
          
            Setting/Participants
            A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study.
          
          
            Study Interventions and Measures
            Rapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4±7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0±12.8 days after their initial test.
          
          
            Results
            In our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81\%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4\% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9\%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9\%).
            The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6\%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9\%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5\%).
            
              In participants with a positive PRNT, a significant decrease in PRNT concentration from 31.8±22.9 (Md=32.0) at T1 to 26.1±17.6 (Md=21.3) at T2 to 21.4±13.4 (Md=16.0) at T3 (χ

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The COVID-19 pandemic has strained intensive care unit (ICU) resources. Tracheotomy is the most frequent surgery performed on ICU patients and can affect the duration of ICU care. We studied the association between when tracheotomy occurs and weaning from mechanical ventilation, mortality, and intraoperative and postoperative complications.
          
          
            Methods
            Multicentre prospective cohort including all COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in 36 hospitals in Spain who received invasive mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy between 11 March and 20 July 2020. We used a target emulation trial framework to study the causal effects of early (7 to 10 days post-intubation) versus late ({\textgreater}10 days) tracheotomy on time from tracheotomy to weaning, postoperative mortality, and tracheotomy complications. Cause-specific Cox models were used for the first two outcomes and Poisson regression for the third, all adjusted for potential confounders.
          
          
            Findings
            We included 696 patients, of whom 142 (20·4\%) received early tracheotomy. Using late tracheotomy as the reference group, multivariable cause-specific analysis showed that early tracheotomy was associated with faster post-tracheotomy weaning (fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [95\% confidence interval (CI)]: 1·31 [1·02 to 1·81]) without differences in mortality (fully adjusted HR [95\% CI]: 0·91 [0·56 to 1·47]) or intraoperative or postoperative complications (adjusted rate ratio [95\% CI]: 0·21 [0·03 to 1·57] and 1·49 [0·99 to 2·24], respectively).
          
          
            Interpretation
            Early tracheotomy reduced post-tracheotomy weaning time, resulting in fewer mechanical ventilation days and shorter ICU stays, without changing complication or mortality rates. These results support early tracheotomy for COVID-19 patients when clinically indicated.
          
          
            Funding
            Supported by the NIHR, FAME, and MRC.
          
          
            Research in context
            
              
                Evidence before this study
                The optimal timing of tracheotomy for critically ill COVID-19 patients remains controversial. Existing guidelines and recommendations are based on limited experiences with SARS-CoV-1 and expert opinions derived from situations that differ from a pandemic outbreak. Most of the available guidance recommends late tracheotomy ({\textgreater}14 days), mainly due to the potential risk of infection for the surgical team and the high patient mortality rate observed early in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                Recent publications have shown that surgical teams can safely perform tracheotomies for COVID-19 patients if they use adequate personal protective equipment. Early tracheotomy seems to reduce the length of invasive mechanical ventilation without increasing complications, which may release crucial intensive care unit (ICU) beds sooner.
                The current recommendations do not suggest an optimal time for tracheotomy for COVID-19 patients, and no study has provided conclusions based on objective clinical parameters.
              
              
                Added value of this study
                This is the first study aiming to establish the optimal timing for tracheotomy for critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The study prospectively recruited a large multicentre cohort of 696 patients under IMV due to COVID-19 and collected data about the severity of respiratory failure, clinical and ventilatory parameters, and whether patients need to be laid flat during their ICU stay (proned). The analysis focused on the duration of IMV, mortality, and complication rates. We used a prospective cohort study design to compare the ‘exposures’ of early (performed at day 7 to 10 after starting IMV) versus late (performed after day 10) tracheotomy and set the treatment decision time on the 7th day after orotracheal intubation.
              
              
                Implications of all the available evidence
                The evidence suggests that tracheotomy within 10 days of starting COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation allows these patients to be removed from ventilation and discharged from ICU quicker than later tracheotomy, without added complications or increased mortality. This evidence may help to release ventilators and ICU beds more quickly during the pandemic.},

            Background
            To identify risk factors associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL) during the first UK COVID-19 wave.
          
          
            Methods
            Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 01/02/2020-30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality.
          
          
            Results
            Over the study period 1,781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1,195 (67\%) were hospitalised, 152 (9\%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23\%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia in-creased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR=4.75, 95\%CI=(1.91,11.84), p=0.001). Having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR=2.34,95\%CI=(1.55,3.54),p{\textless}0.001;OR=2.40, 95\%CI=(1.55,3.73), p{\textless}0.001 respectively) and death (OR=2.61, 95\%CI=(1.59,4.28), p{\textless}0.001;OR=4.07, 95\% CI= (2.48,6.69), p{\textless}0.001 respectively).
          
          
            Conclusions
            We confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify people with learning disabilities and multi-morbidity as additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected during COVID-19 waves.},

            Background
            In May-July 2020 in the New York City area, up to 16\% of pregnant women had reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies.
          
          
            Objective
            To expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels.
          
          
            Study Design
            The Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification.
          
          
            Results
            The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4\% (n=116, 95\% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7\%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95\%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.},

            Participants
            583 COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support
          
          
            Intervention
            Standard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-ß-1a (44 μg of subcutaneous IFN-ß-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days).
          
          
            Measurements
            The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens and safety analyses.
          
          
            Results
            
              Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir
              versus
              control, aOR 0.83, 95\%CI, 0.55 to 1.26, P=0.39; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a
              versus
              control, aOR 0.69, 95\%CI, 0.45 to 1.04, P=0.08; hydroxychloroquine
              versus
              control, aOR 0.93, 95\%CI, 0.62 to 1.41, P=0.75. No significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract was evidenced. Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatments were significantly associated with more SAE.
            
          
          
            Limitations
            Not a placebo-controlled, no anti-inflammatory agents tested.
          
          
            Conclusion
            No improvement of the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract specimens by studied drugs. This comforts the recent Solidarity findings.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Rationale
            The preliminary reports of COVID Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (COVIDARDS) suggest the existence of a subset of patients with higher lung compliance despite profound hypoxemia. Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to non-COVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments.
          
          
            Objectives
            To describe the trajectories of hypoxemia and respiratory compliance in COVIDARDS and associations with outcomes.
          
          
            Methods
            A multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists created the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset (NorthCARDS) leveraging over 11,542 COVID-19 hospital admissions. Data was summarized to describe differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and compared to non-COVIDARDS reports. A sophisticated method of extrapolating PaO2 from SpO2, as well estimating FiO2 from non invasive oxygen delivery devices were utilized to create meaningful trends of derived PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F).
          
          
            Measurements and Main Results
            Of the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 (34·6\%) who had very low lung compliance ({\textless}20ml/cmH2O), 982 (63·2\%) with low-normal compliance (20-50ml/cmH2O), and 34 (2·2\%) with high lung compliance ({\textgreater}50ml/cmH2O). The very low compliance group had double the median time to intubation compared to the low-normal group (107 hours(IQR 26·3, 238·3) vs. 37·9 hours(IQR 4·8, 90·7)). Oxygenation trends have improved in all groups after a nadir immediately post intubation. The P/F ratio improved from a mean of 109 to 155, with the very low compliance group showing a smaller improvement compared to low compliance group. The derived P/F trends closely correlated with blood gas analysis driven P/F trends, except immediately post intubation were the trends diverge as illustrated in the image. Overall, 67·5\% (n=1049) of the patients died during the hospitalization. In comparison to non-COVIDARDS reports, there were less patients in the high compliance category (2.2\%vs.12\%, compliance ≥50mL/cmH20), and more patients with P/F ≤ 150 (57·8\% vs. 45.6\%). No correlation was apparent between lung compliance and P/F ratio. The Oxygenation Index was similar, (11·12(SD 5·67)vs.12·8(SD 10·8)).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Heterogeneity in lung compliance is seen in COVIDARDS, without apparent correlation to degree of hypoxemia. Notably, time to intubation was greater in the very low lung compliance category. Understanding ARDS patient heterogeneity must include consideration of treatment patterns in addition to trajectories of change in patient-level data and demographics.},

	url = {http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.17.20248430},
	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Protecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst HCWs.
          
          
            Methods
            The study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with 98\% specificity and 93\% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
          
          
            Results
            Amongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8\%. Risk factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work, working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103 HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included younger age and working in administration.
          
          
            Conclusions
            SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work.
          
          
            Key Points
            SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity risk factors amongst health care workers included male gender, nonoccupational exposure, food or environmental services role, and COVID-19 unit location. Those missed by occupational screening were younger, in roles without direct patient care, or exposed outside of work.},

            Background
            Direct and indirect COVID19-related mortality is uncertain. This study investigated COVID19-related and all-cause deaths among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of COVID19 epidemic period, assessing mortality risks by pre-existing socio-demographic and medical underlying conditions.
          
          
            Methods
            Population-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals ≥50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (age/sex, comorbidities and medications/vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and main outcomes were COVID19-related deaths (occurred in patients diagnosed with the disease) and all-cause deaths occurred among cohort members between 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Mortality risks were assessed by Cox regression analyses.
          
          
            Results
            Cohort members were followed for 1,356,358 persons-weeks, occurring 576 all-cause deaths (124 COVID19-related). All-cause mortality rate was 42.5 deaths per 100,000 persons-week, being 22.8 in healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, 236.4 in COVID19-excluded/PCR-negative subjects, 493.7 in COVID19-compatible/PCR-unperformed subjects and 4009.1 in COVID19-confirmed patients. In multivariable analyses, increasing age, sex male, nursing-home residence, cancer, neurologic, cardiac or liver disease, receiving diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality; conversely, receiving renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins were associated with reduced risk. Age/years, sex male and nursing-home residence were strong predictors for COVID19-related mortality, but none comorbidity appeared significantly associated with an increased risk.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Apart from direct COVID19-related deaths (which represented almost 22\% of all-cause mortality), theoretically COVID19-excluded patients (PCR-negative) suffered considerable greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, which could explain, in part, the large excess deaths observed across the COVID19 pandemic.},

            Background
            Evidence suggests the role of an inflammatory storm in COVID-19 complications. Colchicine is an orally administered, anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis and coronary disease.
          
          
            Methods
            We performed a randomized, double-blind trial involving non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or clinical criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for 3 days and once daily thereafter) or placebo for 30 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospitalization for COVID-19.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 4488 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint occurred in 4.7\% of the patients in the colchicine group and 5.8\% of those in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.79; 95.1\% confidence interval (CI), 0.61 to 1.03; P=0.08). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 4.6\% and 6.0\% of patients in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively (odds ratio, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.99; P=0.04). In these patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the odds ratios were 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.99) for hospitalization due to COVID-19, 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.23 to 1.07) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.19 to 1.66) for death. Serious adverse events were reported in 4.9\% and 6.3\% in the colchicine and placebo groups (P=0.05); pneumonia occurred in 2.9\% and 4.1\% of patients (P=0.02). Diarrhea was reported in 13.7\% and 7.3\% in the colchicine and placebo groups (P{\textless}0.0001).
          
          
            Conclusion
            
              Among non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, colchicine reduces the composite rate of death or hospitalization. (COLCORONA

	abstract = {Abstract
          COVID-19 is a viral disease that affects people in different ways: Most people will develop mild symptoms; others will require hospitalization, and a few others will die. Hence identifying risk factors is vital to assist physicians in the treatment decision. The objective of this paper is to determine whether unsupervised analysis of risk factors of positive and negative COVID-19 subjects may be useful for the discovery of a small set of reliable and clinically relevant risk-profiles. We selected 13367 positive and 19958 negative hospitalized patients from the Mexican Open Registry. Registry patients were described by 13 risk factors, three different outcomes, and COVID-19 test results. Hence, the dataset could be described by 6144 different risk-profiles per age group. To discover the most common risk-profiles, we propose the use of unsupervised learning. The data was split into discovery (70\%) and validation (30\%) sets. The discovery set was analyzed using the partition around medoids (PAM) method and robust consensus clustering was used to estimate the stable set of risk-profiles. We validated the reliability of the PAM models by predicting the risk-profile of the validation set subjects. The clinical relevance of the risk-profiles was evaluated on the validation set by characterizing the prevalence of the three patient outcomes: pneumonia diagnosis, ICU, or death. The analysis discovered six positives and five negative COVID-19 risk-profiles with strong statistical differences among them. Henceforth PAM clustering with consensus mapping is a viable method for unsupervised risk-profile discovery among subjects with critical respiratory health issues.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Currently used prognostic tools for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are based on clinical and laboratory parameters measured at a single point in time, usually on admission. We aimed to determine how dynamic changes in clinical and laboratory parameters relate to SARS-CoV-2 prognosis. 

Design: retrospective, observational cohort study using routinely collected clinical data to model the dynamic change in prognosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Setting: a single, large hospital in England.

Participants: all patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, UK from 1st February 2020 until 30th November 2020.

Main outcome measures: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, death and discharge from hospital.

Statistical Methods: We split patients into 1st (admissions until 30th June) and 2nd (admissions thereafter) waves. We incorporated all clinical observations, blood tests and other covariates from electronic patient records and follow up until death or 30 days from the point of hospital discharge. We modelled daily risk of admission to ICU or death with a time varying Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: 2,964 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Of 1,374 admitted during the 1st wave, 593 were eligible for ICU escalation, and 466 had near complete ascertainment of all covariates at admission.  Our validation sample included 1,590 confirmed cases, of whom 958 were eligible for ICU admission. Our model had good discrimination of daily need for ICU admission or death (C statistic = 0.87 (IQR 0.85-0.90)) and predicted this daily prognosis better than previously published scores (NEWS2, ISCARIC 4C). In validation in the 2nd wave the score overestimated escalation (calibration slope 0.55), whilst retaining a linear relationship and good discrimination (C statistic = 0.88 (95\% CI 0.81 -0.95)).

Conclusions: A bespoke SARS-CoV-2 escalation risk prediction score can predict need for clinical escalation better than a generic early warning score or a single estimation of risk at admission.},

            Background
            The risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2.
          
          
            Methods
            Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at four major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups.
          
          
            Findings
            Approximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44\% had children in preschool or in school; 18\% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Further research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.},

            Importance
            Characterization of a diverse cohort hospitalized with COVID-19 in a health care system in California is needed to further understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and improve patient outcomes.
          
          
            Objectives
            To investigate the characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and assess factors associated with poor outcomes.
          
          
            Design
            Patient-level retrospective cohort study
          
          
            Setting
            University of California five academic hospitals.
          
          
            Participants
            Patients ≥18 years old with a confirmed test result for SAR-CoV-2 virus hospitalized at five UC hospitals.
          
          
            Exposure
            Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive results on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring hospital admission.
          
          
            Main Outcomes and Measures
            Admission to the intensive care unit, death during hospitalization, and the composite of both outcomes.
          
          
            Results
            Outcomes were assessed for 4,730 patients who were discharged or died during a hospitalization. A total of 846 patients were treated at UC Davis, 1,564 UC Irvine, 1,283 UC Los Angeles, 471 UC San Diego, and 566 UC San Francisco. More than 20\% of patients were ≥75 years of age (75-84: 12.3\%, ≥85: 10.5\%), male (56.5\%), Hispanic/Latino (45.7\%), and Asian (10.3\%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (35.2\%), cardiac disease (33.3\%), and diabetes (24.0\%). The ICU admission rate was 25.2\% (1194/4730), with 7.0\% (329/4730) in-hospital mortality. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 18.8\% (225/1194) died; 2.9\% (104/3536) died without ICU admission. The rate of the composite outcome (ICU admission and/or death) was 27.4\% (1,298/4,730). While controlling for comorbidities, patients of age 75-84 (OR 1.47, 95\% CI: 1.11-1.93) and 85-59 (OR 1.39, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.87) were more likely to experience a composite outcome than 18-34 year-olds. Males (OR 1.39, 95\% CI: 1.21-1.59), and patients identifying as Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.14-1.61), and Asian (OR 1.43, 95\% CI: 1.23-1.82), were also more likely to experience a composite outcome than White. Patients with 5 or more comorbidities were exceedingly likely to experience a composite outcome (OR 2.74, 95\% CI: 2.32-3.25).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Males, older patients, those with pre-existing comorbidities, and those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or Asian experienced an increased risk of ICU admission and/or death.
          
          
            KEY POINTS
            
              Question
              What are the characteristics and outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at five UC Health medical centers in California?
            
            
              Findings
              In this retrospective case series of 4,730 patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 in UC Health’s five medical centers, male (OR 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.23-1.61), Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.14-1.61), and Asian (OR 1.43, 95\% CI: 1.12-1.82) were more likely to be admitted to the ICU and/or die after adjustment for age and comorbidity. ICU admission and/or death was more likely among older individuals and greater numbers of pre-existing conditions.
            
            
              Meaning
              This study describes the experience of a large, diverse cohort of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in five hospitals in California between December 14, 2019 and January 6, 2021.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 10 February 2021.
          We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support.
          
            Report highlights include
            ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 305,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. The five most common symptoms at admission were cough, shortness of breath, history of fever, fatigue/malaise, and altered consciousness/confusion. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and around 40\% of patients {\textgreater}80 years experienced confusion.
            The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 305,241 individuals from 1736 sites across 64 countries.
            The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals:
            
              
                for whom data collection commenced on or before 3 January 2021.

                    The median age is 60 years.
                  
                  
                    A total of 19\% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit.
                  
                  
                    Antibiotic use is high (80.7\% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.)
                  
                  
                    Cough, shortness of breath, history of fever, fatigue/malaise and altered consciousness/confusion were the most common symptoms at admission.
                  
                  
                    Altered consciousness/confusion was also relatively frequent (24,477/109,690) and most common in elderly patients. Overall, elderly patients are less likely to present with URTI symptoms.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Importance
            Essential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          
            Objective
            To identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California.
          
          
            Design
            This cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020.
          
          
            Setting
            Farmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study.
          
          
            Participants
            Individuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, ≥18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.
          
          
            Exposures
            Sociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.
          
          
            Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)
            Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          
          
            Results
            Most farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.
          
          
            Conclusions and Relevance
            Our findings suggest both residential and workplace exposures are contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. Urgent distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is warranted given this population’s increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their work.},

          Cardiovascular (CV) manifestations of COVID-19 infection carry significant morbidity and mortality. Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes: cardiac arrest and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events. In repeating model validation many times, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with an average median early warning time of 18 hours (IQR: 13-20 hours) and an AUROC of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.91-0.92), and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 72 hours (IQR: 12-204 hours) and an AUROC of 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.67-0.73). The COVID-HEART predictor is anticipated to provide tangible clinical decision support in triaging patients and optimizing resource utilization, with its clinical utility potentially extending well beyond COVID-19.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Several studies have reported a reduced risk of death associated with the inpatient use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19 patients, but have been criticized for incurring in several types of bias. Also, most studies have pooled ACEIs and ARBs as if they were a unique group, overlooking their pharmacological differences. We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital continuation of ARBs and ACEIs, in regular users of these drugs, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their discontinuation and also to compare head-to-head ARBs with ACEIs.
          
          
            Methods
            Adult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March, 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95\%CI were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators.
          
          
            Results
            Out of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340(54.4\%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6\% and 27.7\% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95\%CI:0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6\% vs. 27.1\%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8\%,N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1\%,N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95\%CI:0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95\%CI:0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95\%CI:0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95\%CI:0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95\%CI:0.13-0.97) and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95\%CI:0.03-0.97).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Among regular users of ARBs admitted for COVID-19, the in-hospital continuation with them was associated with an improved survival, while this was not observed with ACEIs. Regular users of ARBs should continue with this treatment if admitted for COVID-19, unless medically contraindicated. In admitted ACEI users, a switching to ARBs should be considered, especially among high-risk patients.

            Methods
            Individuals were randomly sampled from electoral lists and invited with household members over 5 years old to be tested for anti–SARS-CoV-2 (IgT, i.e. IgA/IgG/IgM) antibodies by ELISA (Bio-rad). Serum samples were classified according to seroneutralization activity {\textgreater}50\% (NT50) on Vero CCL-81 cells. Age- and sex-adjusted seroprevalence was estimated. Subgroups were compared by chi-square or Fisher exact test and logistic regression.

              Among 2006 individuals, 43 were SARS-CoV-2–positive; the raw seroprevalence was 2.1\% (95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.9), with adjusted metropolitan and national standardized seroprevalence 2.5\% (1.8 to 3.3) and 2.3\% (1.7 to 3.1). Seroprevalence was highest for 20-to 34-year-old participants (4.7\% [2.3 to 8.4]), within than out of socially deprived area (2.5\% vs 1\%,
              P=
              0.02) and with than without intra-family infection (p{\textless}10
              −6
              ). Moreover, 25\% (23 to 27) of participants presented at least one COVID-19 symptom associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p{\textless}10
              −13
              ), with anosmia or ageusia highly discriminant (odds ratio 27.8 [13.9 to 54.5]), associated with dyspnea and fever. Among the SARS-CoV-2-positives, 16.3\% (6.8 to 30.7) were asymptomatic. For 31 of these individuals, positive seroneutralization was demonstrated
              in vitro
              .
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            In this population of very low anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence, a beneficial effect of the lockdown can be assumed, with frequent SARS-CoV-2 seroneutralization among IgT-positive patients.
          
          
            Key Messages
            
              
                Total immunoglobulin antibody (IgT) measurement is an accurate tool to monitor the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a key biological feature to assume the spread of COVID-19 later after the appearance of symptoms.
              
              
                IgT seroprevalence was 2.1\% in the Grand Nancy Metropolitan area, France; was highest for young adults; in socially deprived area, but this was not confirmed at the individual level; and was associated with high intra-family viral transmission.
              
              
                About two thirds of IgT-positive individuals exhibited SARS-CoV-2–positive seroneutralization.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers., SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London., DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data., PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders., RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29\%). 538 (31\%) were from Asian, 340 (20\%) black and 707 (40\%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95\% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95\% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95\% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p{\textless}0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95\% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group., CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19. Copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Patient characteristics, comorbidities, coagulation profile and prevalence of radiologically proven VTE were recorded and compared between groups., RESULTS: More males than females were found in each group. When groups were compared the mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar, as was the incidence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. aPTT was higher in the COVID-19 (30.9 +/- 3.7 SD) vs (12.8 +/- 4.1 SD) the influenza group vs (15.2 +/- 4.1 SD) in controls p {\textless} 0.001, but fibrinogen was lower 6.2 +/- 1.6 SD vs 34.6 +/- 14.0SD vs 30.8 +/- 5.0 SD, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001.

This study aimed to determine the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and COVID-19 pneumonia. The study was conducted at the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Central Anatolia of Turkey. 120 patients with myocardial infarction , 120 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 120 healthy volunteers as a control group were included in the study. The participants filled out the questionnaire that included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Thorson-Powell's Revised Death Anxiety Scale (RDAS). All scores of patient groups were significantly higher than the control group. There was no significant difference in terms of STAI-S, STAI-T, and RDAS scores between COVID-19 pneumonia and MI groups. The anxiety risk increased 2.14-fold for STAI-T and 1.97-fold for STAI-S in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared to the control group. In this study, the state/trait and death anxiety levels of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were as high as patients with myocardial infarction.COVID-19 pneumonia-related anxiety was associated with chronic diseases and smoking.

The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI {\textgreater}= 24and {\textless} 24., RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI {\textless} 24, and 187 patients had BMI {\textgreater}= 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI {\textless} 24. A large number of patients with BMI {\textgreater}= 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI {\textgreater}= 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI {\textgreater}= 24 than those with BMI {\textless} 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI {\textless} 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI {\textgreater}= 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course. Thus, high BMI is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of imported COVID-19.},

There are totally 1547 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the study, alcohol consumption and CS history were evaluated among these patients. The epidemiology, laboratory findings and outcomes of patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied., Results: Our findings indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of CS tend to have more severe outcomes than non-smoking patients. However, alcohol consumption did not reveal significant effects on neither development of severe illness nor death rates in COVID-19 patients., Conclusion: CS is a risk factor for developing severe illness and increasing mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65 +/- 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p {\textless} 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p {\textless} 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p {\textless} 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95\% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95\% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores. AI algorithm is as robust a predictor of adverse patient outcome (death or need for mechanical ventilation) as subjective RALE scores in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.},

	abstract = {This study aims to predict death after COVID-19 using only the past medical information routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs) and to understand the differences in risk factors across age groups. Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65-85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality. The ability to compute precise individual-level risk scores exclusively based on the EHR is crucial for effectively allocating and distributing resources, such as prioritizing vaccination among the general population.},

Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6\%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low ({\textless}50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.87, p {\textless} 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 +/- 10 days), 27 (29.7\%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2\%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3\%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.},

Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes., RESULTS: Among 235 928 participants, 397 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index and higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (RR 1.28 and RR 1.14 per SD increase, respectively), smoking (RR 1.39), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.53), and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.33). Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were both associated with lower risk (RR 0.84 and RR 0.83 per SD increase, respectively). Non-modifiable risk factors included male sex (RR 1.72), black ethnicity (RR 2.00), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.17 per SD increase in Townsend Index), and high cystatin C (RR 1.13 per SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat, less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.

            Patients with coronavirus disease-19 (
            COVID-19
            ) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator
            (tPA
            ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (
            PAI-1
            ) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous
            ex vivo
            clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis. Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted.},

We aimed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and assess outcomes in patients where COVID-19 complicated the treatment of their haematological disorder. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 55 patients with haematological disorders and COVID-19, including 52 with malignancy, 2 with bone marrow failure and 1 immune mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). COVID-19 diagnosis coincided with a new diagnosis of a haematological malignancy in four patients. 82\% of patients were on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at time of COVID-19. Of hospitalised patients, 37\% (19/51) died whilst all four outpatients recovered. Risk factors for severe disease or mortality were similar to other published cohorts. Raised CRP at diagnosis predicted an aggressive clinical course. The majority of patients recovered from COVID-19, despite receiving recent SACT. This suggests that SACT, where urgent, should be administered despite intercurrent CV19 infection, which should be managed according to standard pathway. Delay or modification of therapy should be considered on an individual basis. Long-term follow-up studies in larger patient cohorts are required to assess efficacy of treatment strategies employed during the pandemic.},

We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Methods 29 patient files were investigated in Group 1 and Group 2 was created with 52 consecutive COVID-19 patients with age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, disease course. Results There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of in-hospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in Group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay and transferred to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. Conclusion In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared to consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than fifty. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and May 17th, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI and smoking status. Obesity groups included: BMI 30–40 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. Results Overall, 3,406 patients were included. 572 (17.0\%) of the patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5\%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0\%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was independently associated with mortality (aOR 5.1, 95\% CI 2.3–11.1). For the older population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (aOR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2 – 2.3). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with morbid obesity are more likely to die from COVID-19. This is particularly relevant in the western world where obesity rates are high.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Importance: No therapy to date has been shown to improve survival for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4\% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 ≥50\%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2\% versus 15.0\%, OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8\% vs 80.7\%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1\% vs 15.4\%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07). After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

          ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 20 November 2020.
          We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support.
          
            Report highlights include
            ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 122,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40\% of patients {\textgreater}80 years experienced confusion.
            The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 122,361 individuals from 578 sites across 42 countries. The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals:
            
              
                for whom data collection commenced on or before 26 October 2020.

However, there is limited information on management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant COVID19 infection. Objectives: This multisource national analysis of live data from England was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with ACS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: Multisource data from all acute NHS hospital in England was linked to study the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 ACS compared to non COVID-19 ACS patients. Hierarchical multilevel models were constructed to study the association between COVID19 ACS and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Results: Between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020, 517 (4.0\%) were admitted with COVID- 19 ACS from a total of 12,958 ACS patients. COVID-19 ACS patients were generally older, BAME ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting characteristics compared to non-COVID-19 ACS patients. They were less likely to receive invasive coronary strategy in the form of coronary angiography (67.7\% vs 81.0\%), PCI (30.2\% vs 53.9\%), dual antiplatelet medication 76.3\% vs 88.0\%), and other important secondary medication. Patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (aOR 3.27 95\%CI 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95\%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to non COVID-19 ACS group. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is prevalent but less frequent in the patients hospitalized with ACS in England. Presence of COVID-19 infection in patients with ACS is associated with significant mortality hazard.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. Results 200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18.5\%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9.5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score ≥2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). Conclusions This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Chronic kidney disease patients show a high mortality in case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, to be informed on Nephrology personnel9s sero-status might be crucial for patient protection. However, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. Methods: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies among health care workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the peak phase of the Covid-19 crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. Results: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5\%, 95\% CI: 20.4-31.5) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about two weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1\%, 95\% CI: 2.9-8.8) and IgM positivity in six (2.6\%, 95\% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. 2.1\% (95\% CI: 0.8-5.0) of health care workers showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least two assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven Covid-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from health care workers did not show SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. Conclusions: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among Covid-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Purpose: To examine the risk factors for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 432 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three medical centers in Hubei province from January 1st to April 10th 2020. Primary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death occurring while hospitalized or within 30 days. Results: Of the 432 confirmed patients, 9.5\% were admitted to the ICU, 27.3\% required mechanical ventilation, and 33.1\% died. Total leukocyte count was higher in survivors compared with those who died (8.9 vs 4.8 x 109/l), but lymphocyte counts were lower (0.6 vs 1.0 x 109/l). D-dimer was significantly higher in patients who died compared to survivors (6.0ug/l vs 1.0ug/l, p\&lt;0.0001. This was also seen when comparing mechanically versus non-mechanically-ventilated patients. Other significant differences were seen in AST, ALT, LDH, total bilirubin and creating kinase. The following were associated with increased odds of death: age \&gt; 65 years (adjusted hazard ratio (HR 2.09, 95\% CI 1.02-4.05), severe disease at baseline (5.02, 2.05-12.29), current smoker (1.67, 1.37-2.02), temperature \&gt;39o C at baseline (2.68, 1.88-4.23), more than one comorbidity (2.12, 1.62-3.09), bilateral patchy shadowing on chest CT or X-ray (3.74, 1.78-9.62) and organ failure (6.47, 1.97-26.23). The following interventions were associated with higher CFR: glucocorticoids (1.60, 1.04-2.30), ICU admission (4.92, 1.37-17.64) and mechanical ventilation (2.35, 1.14-4.82). Conclusion: Demographics, including age over 65 years, current smoker, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, were associated with increased risk of mortality. Mortality was also associated with glucocorticoid use, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Take-Home Message: COVID-19 patients with risk factors were more likely to be admitted into ICU and more likely to require mechanical ventilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Patients with COVID-19 can develop myocardial injury and arrhythmia during the course of their illness. However, the underlying risk factors for the development of cardiovascular related manifestations are unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            Using a register-based multi-center cross-sectional design, we analyzed 80 patients with myocardial injury and 401 controls, as well as 71 patients with arrhythmia and 409 controls, all admitted with COVID-19. Putative risk factors for myocardial injury and arrhythmia were evaluated with logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders.
          
          
            Results
            COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had fatigue (66.2\%) and dyspnea (63.7\%), while those with arrhythmia had dyspnea (71.8\%). Patients with myocardial injury and arrhythmia had a significant mortality of 92.5\% and 94.4\%, respectively. A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart diseases was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.71; OR = 7.43, 95\% CI: 3.99-13.83) and arrhythmia (OR = 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.00-3.75; OR = 13.16, 95\% CI: 6.75-25.68). In addition, we found that gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) {\textgreater}50U/L (OR = 2.14, 95\% CI: 1.37-3.32; OR = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.19-2.85), serum creatinine {\textgreater}111μmol/L (OR = 8.96, 95\% CI: 4.4-18.23; OR = 3.71, 95\% CI: 2.01-6.85), serum sodium {\textless}136 mmol/L (OR = 4.68, 95\% CI: 2.46-8.91; OR = 2.06; 95\% CI: 1.06-4.00) were all associated with increased risk of myocardial injury and arrhythmia, respectively.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Our reported clinical characteristics and identified risk factors are important for clinical study of COVID-19 patients developing myocardial injury and arrhythmia.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Importance
            Deaths among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are partially attributed to venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses. Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19.
          
          
            Objective
            To evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            Observational cohort study.
          
          
            Setting
            Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.
          
          
            Participants
            All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1 to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation.
          
          
            Exposures
            Prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants.
          
          
            Main Outcomes and Measures
            30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.
          
          
            Results
            Of 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4\%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99\% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82\%) occurred during hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3\% (95\% CI 13.1-15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7\% (95\% CI 15.1-22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27\% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.66-0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95\% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses.
          
          
            Conclusions and Relevance
            Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. These findings provide strong real-world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.},

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4\%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95\% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95\% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] \&gt;3.25 OR 8.73, 95\% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95\% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of severe (non-ICU) and critically patients (ICU) with COVID-19 at triage, prior hospitalization, in one of the main hospitals in The Balearic Islands health care system. DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67\% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. There were no differences in age or sex among groups (p \&gt;.05). Initial symptoms included fever (100\%), coughing (85\%), dyspnea (76\%), diarrhea (42\%) and asthenia (21\%). The majority of patients in this case series were hospitalized because of low SpO2 (SpO2 below 90\%) and presentation of bilateral pneumonia (94\%) at triage. ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95\% vs 61\%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100\% of the ICU-patients. All the patients included in the study required oxygen therapy. ICU-patients had lymphopenia as well as hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU (p \&lt; .001).Lower albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis measured as longer hospital length (r= -0.472, p \&lt;.001) and mortality (r= -0.424, p=.003). Interestingly we also found, that MCV was lower among of those patients who died (p=.0002). As of April 28, 2020, 10 patients (8 ICU and 2 non-ICU) had died (21\% mortality) and while 100\% of the non-ICU patients had been discharged, 33\% of ICU patients still remained hospitalized (5 in ICU and 2 had been transferred to ward). CONCLUSION Critically ill patients with COVID-19 present lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia as well high levels of inflammation. Lower levels of albumin were associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Albumin might be of importance because of its association with disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6\%), obesity (1737; 41.7\%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8\%). At triage, 30.7\% of patients were febrile, 17.3\% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8\% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1\%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2\%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5\% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2\%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21\%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2\%), 38 (3.3\%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5\%) died, and 831 (72.2\%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2\%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Despite the significant morbidity and mortality caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), our understanding of basic disease epidemiology remains limited. This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5\%), overweight or obese (77.2\%), or had hypertension (56.6\%). At admission, 30.3\% of patients presented with fever (\&gt;38C) and 32.3\% had low oxygen saturation (\&lt;90\%). Among the 16,099 patients with complete hospital records, we observed that 58.9\% had hypoxia, 23.4\% had an ICU stay during hospitalization, 18.1\% were ventilated, and 16.2\% died. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR: 4, 11). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We report summary statistics of key clinical outcomes that provide insights to better understand COVID-19 disease epidemiology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher COVID-19 death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-19 disease4. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. Since March 10th, 2020 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center performed diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients. Overall, 40\% out of 423 patients with cancer were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, 20\% developed severe respiratory illness, including 9\% that required mechanical ventilation, and 9\% that died. On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) within 90 days were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, while receipt of chemotherapy within 30 days and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 illness is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes in patients with cancer. Association between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes will need interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic. Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14/34 HCWs (41\%; 40±14 years, 71\% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32\%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21\%). Mild disease prevailed (79\%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28±18 days), viral shedding (31±10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29±28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93\%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5±7.7 vs 5.0±4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3\%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalisation, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1/8) HCW. Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background. Tocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2\&lt;96\% despite O2-support \&gt;6L/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5\%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7\%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9\%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95\% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p\&lt;0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: On the basis of the preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial, the use of dexamethasone or alternative corticosteroids (CS) is currently recommended in severe COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. However, last updated recommendations have not taken a position either for or against the use of other immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), with or without CS, since results are still limited. Methods: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital to study the characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ, with or without CS, in addition to standard of care (SOC). Data were obtained from routine clinical practice, stored in electronic medical records. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17\%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8\%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 \%) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ, with or without CS was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 (SD 4.3) and 4.3 days (SD 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79\%) survived and 39 (21\%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR=1.09, p\&lt;0.001), chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, p=0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR=4.69, p=0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was the main protective factor against mortality (HR=0.26, p\&lt;0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up. Conclusions: In severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in combined therapy with TCZ, was the main protective factor against in-hospital mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            OBJECTIVE
            Our aim is to investigate high resolution CT features of COVID-19 infection in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and to compare the diagnostic performance of CT scan with RT-PCR test.
          
          
            METHODS
            Data of consecutive patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 infection and presented to our hospital, was collected from March 2, 2020, until April 12, 2020. All patients underwent RT-PCR test; out of which 53.8\% had chest CT scan done. Using RT-PCR as a standard reference, the sensitivity and specify of CT scan was calculated. We also analyzed the most common imaging findings in patients with positive RT-PCR results.
          
          
            RESULTS
            The typical HRCT findings were seen in 50 scans (65.8\%) out of total positive ones; 44 (77.2\%) with positive RT-PCR results and 6 (31.6\%) with negative results. The peripheral disease distribution was seen in 86\%, multilobe involvement in 70\%, bilateral in 82\%, and posterior in 82\% of the 50 scans.
            The ground glass opacities were seen in 50/74 (89.3\%) of positive RT-PCR group. The recognized GGO patterns in these scans were: rounded 50\%, linear 38\%, and crazy-paving 24\%.
            Using RT-PCR as a standard of reference, chest HRCT scan revealed sensitivity of 68.8\% and specificity of 70\%.
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            The commonest HRCT findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were peripheral, posterior, bilateral, multilobe rounded ground glass opacities.},

Here, we explored mechanisms involving the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a potential basis for resistance to targeting KRAS*. Using the inducible \textit{Kras}$^{\textrm{G12D}}$;\textit{Trp53}$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ PDAC mouse model, gain-of-function screens of epigenetic regulators identified \textit{HDAC5} as the top hit enabling KRAS* independent tumor growth. \textit{HDAC5}-driven escaper tumors showed a prominent neutrophil-to-macrophage switch relative to KRAS*-driven tumors. Mechanistically, HDAC5 represses \textit{Socs3}, a negative regulator of chemokine CCL2, resulting in increased CCL2, which recruits CCR2$^{\textrm{+}}$ macrophages. Correspondingly, enforced \textit{Ccl2} promotes macrophage recruitment into the TME and enables tumor recurrence following KRAS* extinction. These tumor-associated macrophages in turn provide cancer cells with trophic support including TGFβ to enable KRAS* bypass in a SMAD4-dependent manner. Our work uncovers a KRAS* resistance mechanism involving immune cell remodeling of the PDAC TME.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Although KRAS* is required for PDAC tumor maintenance, tumors can recur following KRAS* extinction.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95\% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71\%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 is rapidly scattering worldwide, and the number of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is rising, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a total of 490 patients with complete information (39\% female; the average age of 57 ± 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77\%), dry cough (73\%), and fatigue (69\%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35\%), diabetes (28\%), and ischemic heart disease (14\%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18\%. The following comorbidities were significantly different in the positive and negative PCEP groups: acute kidney disease (p=0.008) and diabetes (p=0.026). For signs and symptoms, fatigue (p=0.020) and sore throat (p=0.001) were significantly different. This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in the management of resources following this pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Allergic skin inflammation elicited by epicutaneous immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA), a potential model of atopic dermatitis, was severely impaired in TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice, as evidenced by decreased infiltration of eosinophils and decreased local expression of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines. However, secretion of Th2 cytokines by splenocytes from epicutaneous sensitized TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice in response to OVA was normal. Skin dendritic cells from TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice were normal in their ability to migrate to draining lymph nodes, express activation markers, and induce proliferation and Th2 cytokine production by naïve T cells. CD4$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells from TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice expressed the skin homing receptor E-selectin ligand normally, and homed to the skin normally, but failed to transfer allergic skin inflammation to WT recipients. TSLP enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion \textit{in vitro} by targeting TSLPR on antigen specific T cells. Intradermal injection of anti-TSLP blocked the development of allergic skin inflammation after cutaneous antigen challenge of OVA immunized WT mice. These findings suggest that TSLP is essential for antigen driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin infiltrating effector T cells and could be a therapeutic target in allergic skin inflammation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective
              In earlier studies, patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) who got infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation than comparators. We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD.
            
            
              Results
              We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76\% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76\% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.68–1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95\% CI: 0.86–1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.53–1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95\% CI: 0.93–2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10\% vs 19\%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.17–1.12).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Patients with RMD and comparators had similar risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting for race, smoking and comorbidities. The higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the early RMD cohort was no longer detected in a recent cohort, suggesting improved management over time.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Emerging data on the clinical presentation, diagnostics, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have largely been presented as case series. Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10\%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16\%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82\% vs. 44\%), fatigue (85\% vs. 50\%), and myalgias (61\% vs 27\%); p\&lt;0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55\% vs 34\%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55\% vs. 24\%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79\% vs. 56\%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p\&lt;0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23\% vs. 3\%, p\&lt;0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Covid-19 was diagnosed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demographic, clinical, investigations details and outcomes were recorded. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: Covid-19 was diagnosed in 234 (46.7\%) and data compared with 267 (53.3\%) negative controls. Mean age of covid-9 patients was 35.1+16.6y, 59.4\% were \&lt;40y and 64\% men. Symptoms were in less than 10\% and comorbidities were in 4-8\%. History of BCG vaccination was in 49\% cases vs 10\% controls. Cases compared to controls had significantly greater white cell (6.96+1.89 vs 6.12+1.69x109 cells/L) and lower lymphocyte count (1.98+0.79 vs 2.32+0.91x109 cells/L). No radiological and electrocardiographic abnormality was observed. All these were isolated or quarantined in the hospital and observed. Covid-19 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to prevalent guidelines. One patient needed oxygen support while hospital course was uncomplicated in the rest. All were discharged alive. Conversion to virus negative status was in 10.2+6.4 days and was significantly lower in age \&gt;40y (9.1+5.2) compared to 40-59y (11.3+6.1) and \&gt;60y (16.4+13.3) (p=0.001). Conclusions: This hospital-based registry shows that mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic young covid-19 patients have excellent prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory failure. While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 +/- 7031 ng/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 +/- 3146, p\&lt;0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results 34.3\% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2\% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8\% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7\%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1*109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P\&lt;0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5\% of the pneumonia cases. Conclusion Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has aroused global concerns. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and analyze possible causes for the rapid disease progress to death. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records. Results Among 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 59.4\% were male, 79.2\% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4\%), cardiovascular disease (22.8\%), diabetes (20.8\%) etc. The most common symptoms were fever (76.2\%), cough (58.4\%) and dyspnea (54.5\%). Respiratory failure (99.0\%), acute cardiac injury (52.5\%), sepsis (40.6\%) and acute kidney injury (23.8\%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7*109/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5*109/L, P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0\% vs 91.0\%, P=0.008), and were more likely to suffer sepsis (52.1\% vs 30.2\%, P=0.025). Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Early development of sepsis was associated with the rapid disease progress to death.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Objectives  This study aimed to assess self­‑reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19 in Poland. Patients and methods  This cross­‑sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID­‑19, comorbidities, and smoking status.
Results  Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID­‑19 with a response rate of 43\%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2\% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19, 21.3\% had hypertension, 4.5\% had diabetes, and 3.1\% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2\% of patients with COVID­‑19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6\% of patients. Almost half of patients (47\%) with COVID­‑19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2\% reported diarrhea. Among 1942 interviewed patients, 54.2\% reported at least 1 olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5\% reported both alterations. Self­‑reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2\% and 47.5\%, respectively. Self­‑reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID­‑19 was significantly higher (P {\textless}0.001) in women than men.
Conclusions  This study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in patients with mild­‑to­‑moderate COVID­‑19. Moreover, our study indicated sex differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among non­hospitalized patients with COVID­‑19.},

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor. Current and past tobacco smoking is associated with changes in the ACE2 receptor expression, hypertension, diabetes and worse outcomes following other viral infections. It is hence plausible that smoking is an independent risk factor for hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. Here, we review available evidence for an association between smoking status and hospitalisation for COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which has reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of international concern. It is plausible that former or current smoking status is associated with infection, hospitalisation and/or mortality from COVID-19. Objective: We aimed to estimate the association of smoking status with rates of i) infection, ii) hospitalisation, iii) disease severity, and iv) mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 disease. Methods: This is a living evidence review with frequent updates. We adopted recommended practice for rapid evidence reviews, which involved limiting the search to main databases and having one reviewer extract data and another verify. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via Ovid MEDLINE, medRxiv and expertise within the review team. We included observational or experimental studies with community-dwelling or hospitalised adults aged 16+ years who had received a test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or a diagnosis of COVID-19, providing that data on smoking status were reported. Studies were judged as ‘good’ quality if they: i) had low levels of missing data on smoking status (i.e. {\textless}20\%) and used a reliable self-report measure that distinguished between current, former and never smoking status; AND ii) used biochemical verification of smoking status and reported results from adjusted analyses; OR reported data from a representative/random sample. Studies were rated as ‘fair’ if they fulfilled criterion i) only and were otherwise rated as ‘poor’. Results: Version 5 with searches up to 23 June 2020 included 148 studies, 43 of which were conducted in China, 37 in the US, 15 in the UK, nine in Mexico, nine in Spain, eight in France, six in Italy, five across multiple international sites, two in Israel, and one each from 14 further countries. Thirty-two (21.6\%) studies reported current, former and never smoking status. Twenty-six studies (17.6\%) explicitly reported the proportion missing data on smoking status, which ranged from 0.08\% to 96.4\%. Notwithstanding recording uncertainties, compared with adult national prevalence estimates, recorded current and former smoking rates were generally lower than expected. In 12 ‘fair’ quality studies, current smokers were at reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers (RR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.55-0.88, p = .003, I2 = 90\%). No significant difference was observed between former and never smokers (RR = 1.02, 95\% CI = 0.92-1.12, p = .76, I2 = 72\%). In seven ‘fair’ quality studies, there was no significant difference between current and never (RR = 1.06, 95\% CI = 0.79-1.44, p = .63, I2 = 79\%) or former and never smokers (RR = 1.20, 95\% CI = 0.95-1.51, p = .10, I2 = 79\%) in the risk of requiring admission to hospital with COVID-19 among those testing positive in the community. In six ‘fair’ quality studies, no significant difference in disease severity was observed between current and never smokers (RR = 1.22, 95\% CI = 0.98-1.53, p = .08, I2 = 22\%). Former smokers were at increased risk of greater disease severity compared with never smokers (RR = 1.58, 95\% CI = 1.07-2.32, p = .02, I2 = 68\%). In five ‘fair’ quality studies, current (RR = 1.70, 95\% CI = 1.14-2.55, p = .01, I2 = 29\%) and former smokers (RR = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.57-2.55, p {\textless} .0.001, I2 = 0\%) were at increased risk of in-hospital death compared with never smokers. Conclusions: Across 148 studies, there is substantial uncertainty about the associations of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes. The recorded smoking prevalence in the included studies was generally lower than overall adult national estimates. There was no evidence of reduced risk of admission to hospital for current compared with never smokers among those testing positive in the community. There was some evidence that current compared with never smoking is associated with reduced risk of testing positive in the community but also greater in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. There was some evidence that former compared with never smoking is associated with increased risk of greater disease severity and in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. Implications: Unrelated to COVID-19, smokers are at a greater risk of a range of serious health problems. Given uncertainty around the association of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes, smoking cessation remains a public health priority and high-quality smoking cessation advice including recommendations to use alternative nicotine products should form part of public health efforts during this pandemic. High quality, smoking-specific research is needed to resolve these mixed findings.},

            Objectives
            To address the generalisability of COVID-19’s outcomes to the well-defined but diverse communities of a single City area.
          
          
            Design
            An observational study of COVID-19 outcomes using quality-assured and integrated data from a single UK hospital contextualised to its feeder population and its associated factors (comorbidities, ethnicity, age, deprivation).
          
          
            Setting/Participants
            Single city hospital with a feeder population of 228,632 adults in Wolverhampton’s city area.
          
          
            Main Outcome Measures
            Hospital admissions and mortality.
          
          
            Results
            5558 patients admitted, 686 died (556 in hospital); 930 were COVID-19 admissions (CA),of which 270 were hospital COVID deaths, 47 non-COVID deaths, 36 deaths post-discharge; 4628 non-COVID-19 admissions (NCA), 239 in-hospital deaths (2 COVID), 94 deaths post-discharge. 223,074 adults not admitted, 407 died. Age, gender, multi-morbidity and Black ethnicity (OR 2.1 [95\% CI 1.5-3.2] p{\textless}0.001, absolute excess risk of {\textless}1/1,000) were associated with COVID-19 admission and mortality. The South Asian cohort had lower CA and NCA, lower mortality (CA (0.5 [0.3-0.8], p{\textless}0.01), NCA (0.4 [0.3-0.6] p{\textless}0.001), community deaths (0.5 [0.3-0.7] p{\textless}0.001). Despite many common risk factors for CA and NCA, ethnic groups had different admission rates, and within-groups differing association of risk factors. Deprivation impacted only in White ethnicity, in the oldest age bracket and in a lesser (not most) deprived quintile.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Wolverhampton’s results, reflecting high ethnic diversity and deprivation, are similar to other studies for Black ethnicity, age and comorbidity risk in COVID-19 but strikingly different in South Asians and for deprivation. Sequentially considering population and then hospital based NCA and CA outcomes, we present a complete single health-economy picture. Risk factors may differ within ethnic groups; our data may be more representative of communities with high BAME populations, highlighting the need for locally focussed public health strategies. We emphasise the need for a more comprehensible and nuanced conveyance of risk.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of this study
            
              
                The rapidly developing COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous studies (published, preprints and national public health reports) of its health impacts in relation to ethnicity, co-morbidities and other factors; few studies, however, have attempted to evaluate infection patient data in terms of morbidity and mortality in context of the feeder population and most are limited by incompleteness of data and inability to account for regional variations in factors such as ethnicity and deprivation
              
              
                Our observational study used a high quality and complete dataset from the local population and the hospital serving it to examine the association of purported risk factors with severity and mortality and the results reveal the importance of evaluating such risks in the local, and not just national, population setting taking into account the local variations in patient backgrounds
              
              
                We found an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for Black ethnicity (OR 2.1) but a decreased risk (OR 0.5) for South Asians, compared with white ethnicity; Our analysis reveals that a nuanced approach to studying risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality is important – factoring in regional variation in ethnicity, deprivation etc. specifically linked to the source population
              
              
                We suggest, based on our findings, that understandably rapid analysis and dissemination of studies of COVID-19 risk needs to be tempered by careful consideration of the real implications; we further urge caution in conveying risk messages to the wider community because of an ethical imperative to ensure such messages do not lead to unnecessary fear and deter individuals, particularly from specific ethnic backgrounds, from seeking needed medical assistance.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background In addition to the lack of COVID-19 diagnostic tests for the whole Spanish population, the current strategy is to identify the disease early to limit contagion in the community. Aim To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Design and Setting Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. Method Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Results We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50\% female, 115 (35.7\%) aged ≥ 65 years). The best predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age, male sex (OR=2.99; 95\%CI=1.55 to 6.01), fever (OR=2.18; 95\%CI=1.06 to 4.80), dyspnoea (OR=2.22; 95\%CI=1.14 to 4.24), low oxygen saturation (OR=2.94; 95\%CI=1.34 to 6.42), auscultatory alterations (OR=2.21; 95\%CI=1.00 to 5.29), heart disease (OR=4.37; 95\%CI=1.68 to 11.13), autoimmune disease (OR=4.03; 95\%CI=1.41 to 11.10), diabetes (OR=4.00; 95\%CI=1.89 to 8.36), hypertension (OR=3.92; 95\%CI=2.07 to 7.53), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR=3.56; 95\%CI=1.70 to 7.96), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR=3.02; 95\%CI=1.30 to 7.68), elevated C-reactive protein (OR=2.94; 95\%CI=1.47 to 5.97), elevated D-dimer (OR=2.66; 95\%CI=1.15 to 6.51) and low platelet count (OR=2.41; 95\%CI=1.12 to 5.14). Myalgia or artralgia (OR=0.28; 95\%CI=0.10 to 0.66), dysgeusia (OR=0.28; 95\%CI=0.05 to 0.92) and anosmia (OR=0.23; 95\%CI=0.04 to 0.75) were protective factors.

Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients until June 11th, 2020 were retrieved from the State Health Secretariat of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and death were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 10,713 COVID-19 patients were included in this study; 81.0\% were younger than 60 years, 55.2\% were female, 89.2\% were not hospitalized, 32.9\% had at least one comorbidity, and 7.7\% died. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (67.7\%) and fever (62.6\%); 7.1\% of the patients were asymptomatic. Cardiovascular diseases (23.7\%) and diabetes (10.3\%) were the two most common chronic diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified an association of all explanatory variables, except for cough and diarrhea, with hospitalization. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.95, P \&lt; 0.001) and shortness of breath (OR = 3.55, P \&lt; 0.001) were associated with increase of odds to COVID-19 death in hospitalized patients. Our study provided evidence that older age, male gender, Asian, indigenous or unknown race, comorbidities (smoking, kidney disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), as well as fever and shortness of breath increased the risk of hospitalization. For death outcome in hospitalized patients, only older age and shortness of breath increased the risk.},

However, hospitals in developing countries often cannot measure some of the variables that have been reported as useful. - Objective: To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the novel LOW-HARM score (Lymphopenia, Oxygen saturation, White blood cells, Hypertension, Age, Renal injury, and Myocardial injury). - Design: Demographic and clinical data from patients with known clinical outcomes (death or discharge) was obtained. Patients were grouped according to their outcome. The LOW-HARM score was calculated for each patient and its distribution, potential cut-off values and demographic data were compared. - Setting: Twelve hospitals in ten different cities in Mexico. - Participants: Data from 438 patients was collected. A total of 400 (200 per group) was included in the analysis. - Exposure: All patients had an infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR. - Main Outcome: The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of different cut-offs of the LOW-HARM score to predict death. - Results: Mean scores at admission and their distributions were significantly lower in patients who were discharged compared to those who died during their hospitalization 10 (SD: 17) vs 70 (SD: 28). The overall AUC of the model was 95\%. A cut-off \&gt; 65 points had a specificity of 98\% and a positive predictive value of 96\%. More than a third of the cases (36\%) in the sample had a LOW-HARM score \&gt; 65 points. - Conclusions and relevance: The LOW-HARM score measured at admission is highly specific and useful for predicting mortality. It is easy to calculate and can be updated with individual clinical progression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The first officially registered case of COVID-19 in Brazil was on February 26, 2020. Since then, the situation has worsened with more than 672,000 confirmed cases and at least 36,000 reported deaths at the time of this writing. Accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 is extremely important to offer adequate treatment, and avoid overloading the healthcare system. Characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities and varied clinical symptoms can help in classifying the level of infection severity, predict the disease outcome and the need for hospitalization. Here, we present a study to predict a poor prognosis in positive COVID-19 patients and possible outcomes using machine learning. The study dataset comprises information of 13,690 patients concerning closed cases due to cure or death. Our experimental results show the disease outcome can be predicted with a ROC AUC of 0.92, Sensitivity of 0.88 and Specificity of 0.82 for the best prediction model. This is a preliminary retrospective study which can be improved with the inclusion of further data. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques fed with demographic and clinical data along with comorbidities of the patients can assist in the prognostic prediction and physician decision-making, allowing a faster response and contributing to the non-overload of healthcare systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of specific, neutralizing, antibodies in serum and broncho-alveolar fluid of 145 patients with COVID-19. Surprisingly, early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were found to be typically dominated by antibodies of the IgA isotype. Peripheral expansion of IgA-plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. While the specific antibody response included IgG, IgM and IgA, the latter contributed to a much larger extent to virus neutralization, as compared to IgG. However, specific IgA serum levels notably decrease after one month of evolution. These results represent a challenging observation given the present uncertainty as to which kind of humoral response would optimally protect against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider boosting a potent, although, at least in blood, fading IgA response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Most patients (435 [94.0\%]) had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension (295 patients [63.7\%]), chronic kidney disease (182 patients [39.3\%]), and diabetes (178 patients [38.4\%]). Common symptoms at presentation were cough (347 patients [74.9\%]), fever (315 patients [68.0\%]), and dyspnea (282 patients [60.9\%]). Three hundred fifty-five patients (76.7\%) were hospitalized; 141 (39.7\%) required intensive care unit management and 114 (80.8\%) of those patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.3-3.2;\textit{P} = .001), severe obesity (OR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.4-3.6;\textit{P} = .02), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.3-3.3;\textit{P} = .006) were independently associated with intensive care unit admission.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, healthcare exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43’000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.
          
          
            Aim
            In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.
          
          
            Methods
            Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patient’s admission date.
          
          
            Results
            As of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5\%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2\%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0\%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7\%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5\%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5\%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 −21.1\%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 – 15.8\%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4\%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2\% in adults, 16 – 55.2\% in children), renal (681 – 25.7\%) and cardiac (631 – 23.8\%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1\%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6\%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1\%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8\%) episodes. 527 (14.5\%) deaths were registered, all among adults.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland. We therefore consider it to be a valuable addition to the existing mandatory reporting, providing more precise information on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical course of these cases.},

Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid 19 and investigate factors associated with death. Methods Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid 19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death. Results 470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36\%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57 to 82), and 255 (54.3\%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4\%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4\%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1\%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4\%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5\%). Forty three (9.1\%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3\%) received non-invasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year increase above 40 years 1.87, 95\% CI 1.57 to 2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10 to 2.70), cancer (OR 2.20, 1.27 to 3.81), platelets \&lt;150x103/microlitre (OR 1.93, 1.13 to 3.30), C-reactive protein \&gt;100 micrograms/mL (OR 1.68, 1.05 to 2.68), \&gt;50\% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16 to 3.77) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.60, 1.64 to 4.13). There was no independent association between death and gender, ethnicity, deprivation level, fever, SpO2/FiO2 (oxygen saturation index), lymphopenia or other comorbidities. Conclusions We characterised the first wave of patients with Covid 19 in one of Englands highest incidence areas, determining which factors predict death. These findings will inform clinical and shared decision making, including the use of respiratory support and therapeutic agents.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical information from 1968 patients admitted to a hospital. We built a predictive score based on a logistic regression model in which explicative variables were discretized using classification trees that facilitated the identification of the optimal sections in order to predict inpatient mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. These sections were translated into a score indicating the probability of a patient’s death, thus making the results easy to interpret. Results. Median age was 67 years, 1104 patients (56.4\%) were male, and 325 (16.5\%) died during hospitalization. Our final model identified nine key features: age, oxygen saturation, smoking, serum creatinine, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein, and sodium at admission. The discrimination of the model was excellent in the training, validation, and test samples (AUC: 0.865, 0.808, and 0.883, respectively). We constructed a prognostic scale to determine the probability of death associated with each score. Conclusions: We designed an easily applicable predictive model for early identification of patients at high risk of death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective The impact of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions is not clearly understood. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95\% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95\% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age\&gt;70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95\% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95\% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95\% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background\&amp;Aims: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Results: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity, and for IgG+ was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P\&lt;0.001). At the outbreak start, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7\%, 95\% c.i. 0.3-6\% (P\&lt;0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2\%, 95\% c.i. 2.4-9.0, due to a rise in IgG+ tests to 5\%, 95\%CI 2.8-8.2 (P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7+/-1.3\%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG+ was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM+) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P\&lt;0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 2.4-9.0\% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1\% were men, 37.9\% were obese, and 34.5\% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of five days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation. Lymphocyte improvement was a predictor of good response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need Findings: Between March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76\% compared with 60\% in the non-critical care group (p\&lt;0,05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1,052 (1,009-1,101); p=0,0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1,968 (1,389-2,590) p\&lt;0,0001) both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0,83 (0,76-0,90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p\&lt;0,05) Interpretation: Patients COVID-19 positive presenting at admission with high SOFA score ≥2 combined with CRP ≥ 9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them as a group that will more likely require critical care so further actions might be implemented to improve their prognosis{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Severe COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that may progress to respiratory failure. These patients also develop cytokine storm syndrome, and organ dysfunctions, which is a clinical picture that resembles sepsis. Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as an important factors of tissue damage in sepsis, we investigated whether NETs would be produced in COVID-19 patients and participate in the lung tissue damage. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and respective healthy controls were enrolled. NETs concentration was assessed by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay or by confocal immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs was analyzed in human epithelial lung cells (A549 cells). The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma and tracheal aspirate from COVID-19 patients and their neutrophils spontaneously released higher levels of NETs. NETs were also found in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. Notably, viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce in vitro release of NETs by healthy neutrophils in a PAD-4-dependent manner. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Design
              Population-based retrospective cohort study.
            
            
              Setting
              Twelve primary care centres (PCCs) in Tarragona (Spain).
            
            
              Participants
              79 083 people (77 676 community-dwelling and 1407 nursing-home residents), who were all individuals aged {\textgreater}50 years affiliated to the 12 participating PCCs.
            
            
              Outcomes
              Baseline cohort characteristics (age, sex, vaccinations, comorbidities and chronic medications) were established at study start (1st. March 2020) and primary outcome was time to COVID-19 confirmed by PCR among cohort members throughout the epidemic period (from 1st. March 2020 to 23rd. May 2020). Risk for suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable HRs adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and medications use.
            
            
              Results
              During the study period, 2324 cohort members were PCR-tested, with 1944 negative and 380 positive results, which means an incidence of 480.5 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 persons-period. Assessing the total study cohort, only age (HR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p=0.002), nursing-home residence (HR 21.83; 95\% CI 16.66 to 28.61; p{\textless}0.001) and receiving diuretics (HR 1.35; 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.76; p=0.026) appeared independently associated with increased risk. Smoking (HR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.93; p=0.022), ACE inhibitors (HR 0.68; 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.046) and antihistamine (HR 0.47; 95\% CI 0.22 to 1.01; p=0.052) were associated with a lower risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, cancer (HR 1.52; 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.24; p=0.035), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.82; 95\% CI 1.08 to 3.07; p=0.025) and cardiac disease (HR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.06 to 2.19; p=0.021) emerged to be also associated with an increased risk. Receiving ACE inhibitors (HR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.44 to 0.99; p=0.046) and influenza vaccination (HR 0.63; 95\% CI 0.44 to 0.91; p=0.012) was associated with decreased risk.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID-19. Conversely, receiving ACE inhibitors, antihistamine and influenza vaccination could be protective, which should be closely investigated in further studies specifically focused on these concerns.},

            PURPOSE
            Clinical course in COVID-19 patients is uncertain. This study investigated possible early prognostic factors among middle-aged and older adult and explored prognostic rules stratifying risk of patients.
          
          
            METHODS
            Community-based retrospective cohort study that included 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients ≥50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed.
          
          
            RESULTS
            Of the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6\%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16\%) deceased. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95\% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnea (OR: 5.41; 95\% CI: 2.74-10.69; p{\textless}0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95\% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (including the above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95\% CI: 0.774-0.882).
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            Clinical course of COVID-19 is early unpredictable, but simple clinical tools as the proposed CD65-M rule (pending external validation) may be helpful assessing these patients in primary care settings.},

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data collected from the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CatSalut) in Catalonia, a region of Spain. PARTICIPANTS Using data collected between 1 March and 1 June 2020, we conducted the following comparative analyses: people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (328 892) vs Catalonia9s entire population (7 699 568); COVID-19 cases who required hospitalisation (37 638) vs cases who did not require hospitalisation (291 254); and COVID-19 cases who died during the study period vs cases who did not die during the study period (12 287). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 (infection, hospitalisation, or death). We analysed sociodemographic and environment variables (such as residing in a nursing home) and the presence of previous comorbidities. RESULTS A total of 328 892 cases were considered to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.27\% of total population). The main risk factors for the diagnostic were: female gender (risk ratio [RR] =1.49; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] =1.48-1.50), age (45-64 years old; RR=1.02; 95\% CI=1.01-1.03), high comorbidity burden (GMA index) (RR=3.03; 95\% CI=2.97-3.09), reside in a nursing home (RR=11.82; 95\% CI=11.66-11.99), and smoking (RR=1.06; 95\% CI=1.05-1.07). During the study period, there were 37 638 (11.4 \%) hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and the risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.45; 95\% CI=1.43-1.48), age \&gt; 65 (RR=2.38; 95\% CI=2.28-2.48), very low individual income (RR=1.03; 95\% CI=0.97-1.08), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.15; 95\% CI=4.89-5.42). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were obesity (RR=1.23; 95\% CI=1.20-1.25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR=1.19; 95\% CI=1.15-1.22), heart failure (RR=1.19; 95\% CI=1.16-1.22), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.07; 95\% CI=1.04-1.10), and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities (RR=1.06; 95\% CI=1.03-1.10). A total of 12 287 deaths (3.73\%) were attributed to COVID-19, and the main risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.73; 95\% CI=1.67-1.81), age \&gt; 65 (RR=37.45; 95\% CI=29.23-47.93), residing in a nursing home (RR=9.22; 95\% CI=8.81-9.65), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.25; 95\% CI=4.60-6.00). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were: heart failure (RR=1.21; 95\% CI=1.16-1.22), chronic kidney disease (RR=1.17; 95\% CI=1.13-1.22), and diabetes mellitus (RR=1.10; 95\% CI=1.06-1.14). These results did not change significantly when we considered only PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Female gender, age between 45 to 64 years old, high burden of comorbidities, and factors related to environment (nursing home) play a relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. In addition, we found risk factors for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 that had not been described to date, including comorbidity burden, neuro-psychiatric disorders, and very low individual income. This study supports interventions for transmission control beyond stratify-and-shield strategies focused only on protecting those at risk of death. Future COVID-19 studies should examine the role of gender, the burden of comorbidities, and socioeconomic status in disease transmission, and should determine its relationship to workplaces, especially healthcare centres and nursing homes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3\% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9\%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6\%]), diabetes (12 [8.9\%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2\%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0\%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9\%]), cough (102 [76.5\%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5\%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100\%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7\%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7\%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8\%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: New York City is the US epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Early international data indicated that comorbidity contributes significantly to poor prognosis and fatality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is not known to what degree medical comorbidity and sociodemographic determinants impact COVID-19 mortality in the US. Methods: Evaluation of de-identified electronic health records of 7,592 COVID-19 patients confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 lab tests in New York City. Medical comorbidites and outcome of mortality, and other covariates, including clinical, sociodemographic, and medication measures were assessed by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Of common comorbid conditions (hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cancer), when adjusted for covariates, chronic kidney disease remained significantly associated with increased odds of mortality. Patients who had more than one comorbidities, former smokers, treated with Azithromycin without Hydroxychloroquine, reside within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens Higher had higher odds of death. Conclusions: Increasing numbers of comorbid factors increase COVID-19 mortality, but several clinical and sociodemographic factors can mitigate risk. Continued evaluation of COVID-19 in large diverse populations is important to characterize individuals at risk and improve clinical outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the United States. Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52\% of patients were male and 63\% were non-white. Hypertension (64\%), hyperlipidemia (62\%), obesity (37\%), diabetes mellitus (28\%), chronic kidney disease (24\%) and lung disease (21\%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24\%) died. Older age (\&gt;70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p\&lt;0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p\&lt;0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcome in future outbreaks of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Method: In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological ﬁndings of patients conﬁrmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People’s Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020.
Results: Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8\%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8\%)], cough [102(81.6\%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6\%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4\%) patients. 100(80.0\%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8\%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2\%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47 (37.6\%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16).
Conclusion: In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.},

              Retrospective observational study using electronic medical record data.
            
            
              Setting
              Five member hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC).
            
            
              Participants
              28 336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 24 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, including 6158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases.
            
            
              Main outcomes and measures
              Positive test rates and in-hospital mortality were assessed for different racial groups. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities.
            
            
              Results
              Hispanics (29\%) and African Americans (25\%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p{\textless}0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray’s T=248.9; p{\textless}0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95\% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95\% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. In addition, we identified key clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk of a severe infection response and predict survival.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background England, UK has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in USA and elsewhere, disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0\% (95\% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0\% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3\% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9\% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9\% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2\%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8\%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3\%) and April (47.5\%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90\% (0.86, 0.94). Conclusion The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups and health and care home workers. The higher risk of infection in these groups may explain, at least in part, their increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we characterize overall health, physical health and mental health of patients one month after discharge for severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients ≥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS Global Health-10. Results: A total of 161 patients (40.6\% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3\%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37\%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74\%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31\%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p\&lt;0.001. Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state (43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state, (54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p \&lt;0.001. A total of 52/148 (35.1\%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148 (13.5\%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: There is currently a paucity of data describing bacterial coinfections, related antibiotic prescribing patterns, and the potential role of antimicrobial stewardship in the care of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted from March 10, 2020 to April 21, 2020 in admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were included if ≥ 18 years old and admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Data was collected via chart review from the enterprise electronic health record database. Data collected include factors driving antibiotic choice, indication, and duration of therapy as well as microbiological data. Findings: Antibiotics were initiated on admission in 87/147 (59\%) patients. Of these, 85/87 (98\%) prescriptions were empiric. The most common indication for empiric antibiotics was concern for community-acquired pneumonia (76/85, 89\%) with the most prescribed antibiotics being ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was two days (interquartile range 1-5). No patients had a community-acquired bacterial respiratory coinfection, but 10/147 (7\%) of patients were found to have concurrent bacterial infections from a non-respiratory source, and one patient was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of admission for COVID-19. Interpretation: Bacterial coinfection in patients with COVID-19 was infrequent. Antibiotics are likely unnecessary in patients with mild symptoms. There is little role for broad-spectrum antibiotics to empirically treat multidrug resistant organisms in patients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. Antimicrobial stewardship remains important in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Background
            Whether diabetes is associated with COVID-19-related mortality remains unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            In this retrospective case-series study we examined the risk of death associated with self-reported diabetes in symptomatic adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were identified through the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Survival time was right-censored at 28 days of follow-up.
          
          
            Results
            Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 included in the study, 120,476 (16\%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Patients with diabetes had a 49\% higher relative risk of death than those without diabetes (Cox proportional-hazard ratio; 1.49 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The relative risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age (P=0.004). The hazard ratios were 1.66 (1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (1.12-1.16) in hospitalized patients. The 28-day survival for inpatients with and without diabetes was, respectively, 73.5\% and 85.2\% for patients 20-39 years of age; 66.6\% and 75.9\% for patients 40-49 years of age; 59.4\% and 66.5\% for patients 50-59 years of age; 50.1\% and 54.6\% for patients 60-69 years of age; 42.7\% and 44.6\% for patients 70-79 years of age; and 38.4\% and 39.0\% for patients 80 years of age or older. In patients without COVID-19 (878,840), the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.78 (1.73-1.84).
          
          
            Conclusion
            In symptomatic adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, diabetes was associated with higher mortality. This association decreased with age.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: COVID-19 induces progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, mostly due to a dysregulated inflammatory response. Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g/L, p\&lt;0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p\&lt;0.0001] and death rate (52.4\% vs 21.7\%, p\&lt;0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex. Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a viral pneumonia together with other extrapulmonary complications. Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5\%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50\% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5\%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P\&lt;0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), γ-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P\&lt;0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP≥140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,γ-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP≥160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4\% VS 20.0\%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25\%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged \&gt;60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p\&lt;0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for COVID-19 complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. To date, the most globally accepted definitions of at-risk patients rely, primarily, on epidemiological characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, such characterization overlooks, and fails to correct for, the prevalence of existing conditions in the wider SARS-CoV-2 positive population. Here, we analyze the complete medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (N=4,353) in a large Israeli health organization (representing a population of 2.3 million people), of whom 173 experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, to identify the conditions that increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications, as previously reported. Interestingly, it also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95\% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P-value = 0.014) as well cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals ≥ 65 year old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P-value \&lt; 0.001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment efforts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives:To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with co-morbid neurological symptoms. Design:Retrospective case series. Setting:Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4\%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4\%), 20 had dementia (18.9\%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4\%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7\%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8\%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8\%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9\%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9\%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5\%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5\%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9\%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16\%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6\%). Eight patients (7.5\%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2\%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4\%] vs. 4 [8.5\%], P \&lt; 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3\%] vs. 9 [19.1\%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Amid all 93 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, only 32 (34.4\%) were taking aspirin, 13 (14\%) taking clopidogrel, and 33 (35.5\%) taking statins. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases had an advanced age, a high rate of severe illness, and a high mortality rate. Among the neurological symptoms, altered mental status was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: Mortality risk scores, such as SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65, are quick, effective tools for communicating a patient9s prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions. Most use simple calculations that can be performed by hand. While several COVID-19 specific risk scores exist, they lack the ease of use of these simpler scores. The objectives of this study were (1) to design, validate, and calibrate a simple, easy-to-use mortality risk score for COVID-19 patients and (2) to recalibrate SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Design: Retrospective cohort study incorporating demographic, clinical, laboratory, and admissions data from electronic health records. Setting: Multi-hospital health system in New York City. Five hospitals were included: one quaternary care facility, one tertiary care facility, and three community hospitals. Participants: Patients (n=4840) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020. Main outcome measures: Gray9s K-sample test for the cumulative incidence of a competing risk was used to assess and rank 48 different variables9 associations with mortality. Candidate variables were added to the composite score using DeLong9s test to evaluate their effect on predictive performance (AUC) of in-hospital mortality. Final AUCs for the new score, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 were assessed on an independent test set. Results: Of 48 variables investigated, 36 (75\%) displayed significant (p\&lt;0.05 by Gray9s test) associations with mortality. The variables selected for the final score were (1) oxygen support level, (2) troponin, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) lymphocyte percentage, (5) Glasgow Coma Score, and (6) age. The new score, COBALT, outperforms SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 at predicting mortality in this COVID-19 population: AUCs for initial, maximum, and mean COBALT scores were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.92, compared to 0.77, 0.87, and 0.87 for SOFA. We provide COVID-19 specific mortality estimates at all score levels for COBALT, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65. Conclusions: The COBALT score provides a simple way to estimate mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with superior performance to SOFA and other scores currently in widespread use. Evaluation of SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in this population highlights the importance of recalibrating mortality risk scores when they are used under novel conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study9s approach to score design could also be applied in other contexts to create simple, practical and high-performing mortality risk scores.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rationale: The Infectious Diseases Society of America has identified the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load for prognostication purposes as a key research question. Objectives: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study among adult patients admitted to the hospital between March 31st to April 10th, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) ≥35), intermediate (25 \&lt; Ct \&lt; 35), and high (Ct ≤ 25) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: A composite outcome of death, intubation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used. Secondary outcomes included the severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Main Results: Of 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from March 31st to April 10th, 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21-28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p\&lt;0.001), and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, a high genomic load remained an independent predictor of the primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, that above and beyond age, comorbidity, and severity of illness on presentation, may be used to risk-stratify patients, and call for a quantitative diagnostic assay to become available. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide. A large proportion of COVID-19 patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes. But whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of COVID-19 has not been well described. Methods We included COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to Tongji Hospital, Tongji medical college of HUST (Wuhan, China) from January, 27, 2020 to March, 8, 2020 in this retrospective cohort study. The final date of follow-up was March, 30, 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Prevention and control Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia published by National Health Commission of the People9 s Republic of China and WHO interim. Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms and compared among different groups. Results 1031 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were dead in hospital. 73\% of 165 dead patients had complicated chronic comorbidities. Of the 1031 patients, 514 (50\%) were combined with chronic comorbidities, and showed CFR 2.8 times as that of patients without any underlying disease. The number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases. The univariable regression revealed that patients in the simple hypertension group showed overall risk higher than those in the simple diabetes mellitus group. In the age-grouped research, patients in the hypertension senile group were proved to be at the highest risk, which might be associated with the level of LDH and eGFR. In this retrospective cohort study, 166 (43\%) patients with hypertension took CCB during the hospitalization, the odds ratio of CFR in patients with hypertension taking CCB group was 0.68 (P = 0.155), compared to those not. Conclusion Our data shows that the clinical manifestations of most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are actually systemic syndromes, although COVID-19 is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and does play a critical role in improving patients9 clinical outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in patients with COVID-19 should be a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Intrinsically generated patterns of coupled neuronal activity are associated with the dynamics of specific brain states. Sensory inputs are extrinsic factors that can perturb these intrinsic coupling modes, creating a complex scenario in which forthcoming stimuli are processed. Studying this intrinsic-extrinsic interplay is necessary to better understand perceptual integration and selection. Here, we show that this interplay leads to a reconfiguration of functional cortical connectivity that acts as a mechanism to facilitate stimulus processing. Using audiovisual stimulation in anesthetized ferrets, we found that this reconfiguration of coupling modes is context specific, depending on long-term modulation by repetitive sensory inputs. These reconfigured coupling modes lead to changes in latencies and power of local field potential responses that support multisensory integration. Our study demonstrates that this interplay extends across multiple time scales and involves different types of intrinsic coupling. These results suggest a previously unknown large-scale mechanism that facilitates multisensory integration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. Results An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7\%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7\%), cough (75.0\%), fatigue (75.0\%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6\%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0\%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1\%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4\%) and urticaria (1.4\%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4\%) patients and current smokers (1.4\%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6\%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4\%) and eosinopenia (52.9\%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P {\textless} .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P {\textless} .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P {\textless} .001). Conclusion Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging ﬁndings.
Methods: Patients conﬁrmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging ﬁndings.
Results: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (r = À0.657, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 Æ 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8\%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and conﬁrmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P {\textless} 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and Creactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P {\textless} 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.
Conclusion: Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Physical activity (PA) is known to be a protective lifestyle factor against several non-communicable diseases while its impact on infectious diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not as clear.
Methods: We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associations between both objectively and subjectively measured PA collected prospectively and COVID-19 related outcomes (overall COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, outpatient COVID-19, and COVID-19 death) in the UK Biobank cohort. Subsequently, we tested causality by using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.
Results: In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) is associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.80 (0.69, 0.93) and 0.74 (0.58, 0.95), respectively. No association is found between self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and COVID-19 related outcomes. No association is found by MR analyses.
Conclusions: Our results indicate a protective effect of objectively measured PA and COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient COVID-19 and overall COVID-19) independent of age, sex, measures of obesity, and smoking status. Although the MR analyses do not support a causal association, that may be due to limited power. We conclude that policies to encourage and facilitate exercise at a population level during the pandemic should be considered.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to develop risk scores based on clinical characteristics at presentation to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients. 641 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected from 4997 persons under investigation. We performed a retrospective review of medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation. Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death. Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes. The model was validated by splitting the data into 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count. Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age. The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables. The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95\% CI, 0.63–0.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95\% CI, 0.73–0.92], p{\textless}0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset. This study identified key independent clinical variables that predicted ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19. This risk score system may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.},

	abstract = {Aim
Since December 2019, new COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred and spread around the world. However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases.
Methods
We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
Results
Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 \% developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 \% had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 \%) and cough (21.9 \%). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 \% were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 \%) and diabetes (5.5 \%), 10.9 \% were current smokers, 30.1 \% had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 \% showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 \% severe cases and 2.7 \% critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 109/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes.
Conclusion
The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 \%, which is lower than the 26.1 \% reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.},

Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94\%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25 patients achieved accuracy of 80\%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. Our model captured predictive dynamics of LDH and CK while their levels were in the normal range.

Methods: Data were retrospective collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital. We described the clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding of patients with COVID-19 and evaluated factors associated with prolonged virus shedding by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Among 238 patients, the median age was 55.5 years, 57.1\% were female, 92.9\% (221/238) used arbidol, 58.4\% (139/238) used arbidol combination with interferon. The median time from illness onset to start arbidol was 8 days (IQR, 5-14 days) and the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding was 23 days (IQR, 17.8-30 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who received arbidol \&gt;7 days after illness onset, compared with those in whom arbidol treatment was started less than or equal to7 days after illness onset (HR, 1.738 [95\% CI, 1.339-2.257], P \&lt; .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that prolonged viral shedding was significantly associated with initiation arbidol more than seven days after symptom onset (OR 2.078, 95\% CI [1.114-3.876], P .004), more than 7 days from onset of symptoms to first medical visitation (OR 3.321, 95\% CI[1.559-7.073], P .002), illness onset before Jan.31, 2020 (OR 3.223, 95\% CI[1.450-7.163], P .021). Arbidol combination with interferon was also significantly associated with shorter virus shedding (OR .402, 95\% CI[.206-.787], P .008). Conclusions: Early initiation of arbidol and arbidol combination with interferon as well as consulting doctor timely after illness onset were helpful for SARS-CoV-2 clearance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Background
              Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency. Here, we developed and validated a practical model based on the data from a multi-center cohort in China for early identification and prediction of which patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
            
            
              Methods
              Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort.
            
            
              Results
              The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We established an early prediction model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission, even in community health centers. This model can be conveniently used to predict the individual risk for ICU admission of patients with COVID-19 and optimize the use of limited resources.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures. Design: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. Setting: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. Methods: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton9s IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung9s self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). Results: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81\% (95\% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44\% (95\% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70\% (95\% CI: 24.63- 33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95\% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. Conclusion: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association of olfactory dysfunction (OD) with hospitalization for COVID-19. Study Design: Multi-center cohort study. Setting: Emergency departments of thirteen COVID-19-designed hospitals in Kurdistan province, Iran. Subjects and Methods: Patients presenting with flu-like symptoms who tested positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19 between May 1st and 31st, 2020. At the time of presentation and enrollment, patients were asked about the presence of OD, fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, rhinorrhea and sore throat. The severity of OD was assessed on an 11-point scale from 0 (none) to 10 (anosmia). Patients were either hospitalized or sent home for outpatient care based on standardized criteria. Results: Of 203 patients, who presented at a mean of 6 days into the COVID-19 disease course, 25 patients (12.3\%) had new OD and 138 patients (68.0\%) were admitted for their COVID-19. Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p{\textless}0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0\% sensitivity and 34.3\% specificity. On univariate logistic regression, hospitalization was associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95\%CI: 1.085-6.911, p=0.049). However, hospitalization for COVID-19 was not associated with OD (OR=3.22, 95\% CI: 0.57-18.31, p=0.188) after controlling for confounding demographics and comorbidities. Conclusion: OD may be associated with hospitalization for (and therefore more severe) COVID-19. However, this association between OD and COVID-19 severity is more likely driven by patient characteristics linked to OD, such as greater numbers of COVID-19 symptoms experienced or high-risk comorbidities.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23\%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24\%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18\%. Any aPL was present in 52\% of patients using the manufacturer9s threshold and in 30\% using a more stringent cutoff (\&gt;40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Aim
            To determine whether healthcare workers (HCW) hospitalized in Spain due to COVID-19 have a worse prognosis than non-healthcare workers (NHCW).
          
          
            Methods
            Observational cohort study based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide registry that collects sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain. Patients aged 20-65 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality.
          
          
            Results
            As of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5\%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4\% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7\% vs. 3.9\%; p=0.024 and 0.7\% vs. 4.8\%; p{\textless}0.001 respectively). Age, male sex and comorbidity, were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and healthcare working with lower mortality (OR 0.219, 95\%CI 0.069-0.693, p=0.01). 30-days survival was higher in HCW (0.968 vs. 0.851 p{\textless}0.001).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Hospitalized COVID-19 HCW had fewer comorbidities and a better prognosis than NHCW. Our results suggest that professional exposure to COVID-19 in HCW does not carry more clinical severity nor mortality.},

Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.
Setting 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission.
Participants 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19.
Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital.
Results The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60\%, n=12 068; women 40\%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31\%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21\%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18\%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16\%, 2830/17 506); 23\% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41\% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26\% (5165/20 133) died, and 34\% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17\% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28\% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32\% (958/3001) died, and 41\% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17\% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37\% (618/1658) died, and 46\% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital.
Conclusions ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity. This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. Methods Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Results The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. Conclusion All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.},

We aimed to describe the characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients and give some suggestions to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods We analyzed 616 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients who were admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 13, 2020 to February 16, 2020. Telephone interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic data. Results Of the 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients, all of them had tested at least 3 times of nucleic acid, 3 were believed to be non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with confirmed patients, antibody negative probable patients were younger (P=0.017), exhibited similar symptoms and chest CT images, had higher lymphocyte count (P=0.004) and albumin level (P\&lt;0.001), showed lower lactate dehydrogenase level (P=0.011) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P\&lt;0.001). During hospitalization, all the 35 patients had contacted with confirmed COVID-19 patients, but all used general face mask for protection and maintained a social distance of more than one meter from each other. All the isolation wards were kept ventilation and disinfected once a day. After discharged from hospital, all of them had negative nucleic acid tests and no one developed symptoms again. Conclusions The conditions of patients with AbN probable COVID-19 were less critical than those of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Room ventilation and daily disinfection, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance might be helpful to prevent patients from hospital acquired COVID-19 infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Understanding community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial to inform public health decisions. Research on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households and other close settings using serological testing is scarce.
          
          
            Methods
            We invited COVID-19 cases diagnosed between February 27 and April 1, 2020 in canton of Vaud, Switzerland, to participate, along with household members and other close contacts. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using a Luminex immunoassay. We estimated factors associated with serological status using generalized estimating equations.
          
          
            Findings
            Overall, 219 COVID-19 index cases, 302 household members, and 69 other close contacts participated between May 4 and June 27, 2020. More than half of household members (57·2\%, 95\%CI 49·7-64·3) had developed a serologic response to SARS-CoV-2, while 19·0\% (95\%CI 10·0-33·2) of other close contacts were seropositive. After adjusting for individual and household characteristics, infection risk was higher in household members aged 65 or more than in younger adults (aOR 3·63, 95\%CI 1·05-12·60), and in those not strictly adhering to simple hygiene rules like hand washing (aOR 1·80, 95\%CI 1·02-3·17). The risk was lower when more than 5 people outside home were met during the semi-confinement, compared to none (aOR 0·35, 95\%CI 0·16-0·74). The individual risk of household members to be seropositive was lower in large households (22\% less per each additional person).
          
          
            Interpretation
            We find that, during semi-confinement, household members of a COVID-19 case were at very high risk of getting infected, 3 times more than close contacts outside home. This highlights the need to provide clear messages on specific protective measures applicable at home. For elderly couples, who were especially at risk, providing them external support for daily basic activities is essential.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Outcomes in pregnancies complicated by preexisting diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and gestational diabetes mellitus have improved, but there is still excess morbidity compared with normal pregnancy. Management strategies appropriately focus on maternal glycemia, which demonstrably improves pregnancy outcomes for mother and infant. However, we may be reaching the boundaries of obtainable glycemic control for many women. It has been acknowledged that maternal lipids are important in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Elevated maternal lipids are associated with preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and large-for-gestational-age infants. Despite this understanding, assessment of management strategies targeting maternal lipids has been neglected to date. Consideration needs to be given to whether normalizing maternal lipids would further improve pregnancy outcomes. This review examines the dyslipidemia associated with pregnancy complicated by diabetes, reviews possible therapies, and considers whether it is time to start actively managing this aspect of maternal metabolism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Mortality attributable to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 2 infection occurs mainly through the development of viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Research Question: The objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. Study Design and Methods: Analysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively. Results: The cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5\%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28\%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4\%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI)≥ 40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts\&lt;700x109/L, LDH\&gt;450 U/L, ferritin \&gt;862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein \&gt;11 mg/dL, and D-dimer \&gt;1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95\% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41\% (95\% CI 38\%-45\%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with two-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone. Conclusions: Among those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly one in ten progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be placed at a minimum on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Infection by the new corona virus strain SARS-CoV-2 and its related syndrome COVID-19 has caused several hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Patients of higher age and with preexisting chronic health conditions are at an increased risk of fatal disease outcome. However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of comorbidities to death yet is missing. Here, we report autopsy findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as the most immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in COVID-19 remain uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53\% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34\%), nausea (27\%), vomiting (16\%), and abdominal pain (11\%). In 74\% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35\% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77\% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95\% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Background
            Hospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study.
          
          
            Methods and Findings
            Overall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95\% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission.
            The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4\% [95\% CI 1.9–2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9\%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Patient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To examine if baseline soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) can predict whether patients with COVID-19 symptoms will need mechanical ventilation during a 14-day follow-up. Furthermore, to examine differences in demographics, clinical signs, and biomarkers in patients tested either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN Prospective cohort study including patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. SETTING Copenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS 407 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were included from the Emergency Department (ED). Patients were included from March 19 to April 3 and follow-up data was collected until April 17, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. Furthermore, we analysed differences between patients testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and disease severity outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients according to baseline suPAR. BACKGROUND Patients admitted to ED with clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection need a safe and quick triage, in order to determine if an in-hospital stay is necessary or if the patient can safely be isolated in their own home with relevant precautions. suPAR is a biomarker previously shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in acute medical patients. We aimed to examine if suPAR at baseline presentation is predictive of respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we examined demographic, clinical, and biochemical differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients. RESULTS Among the 407 symptomatic patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (47-77), 58\% were women, and median suPAR was 4.2 ng/ml (2.7-6.4). suPAR level below 4.75 ng/ml at admission ruled out respiratory failure during follow-up with an area under the curve (95\% CI) of 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and a negative predictive value of 99.5\%. Of the 407 symptomatic patients, 117 (28.8\%) had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with significant differences in vital signs, cell counts, and biomarkers compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients eligible for mechanical ventilation (N=87), 26 (30\%) developed respiratory failure. Best baseline predictors of respiratory failure were suPAR with an area under the curve (95\% CI) of 0.88 (0.80-0.95), EWS 0.84 (0.75-0.93), lactate dehydrogenase 0.82 (0.71-0.93), and C-reactive protein 0.80 (0.70-0.89). CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 affects several patient parameters underpinning the severe impact of the infection. A low suPAR level (\&lt;4.75 ng/ml) at baseline is a useful biomarker for aiding clinical decisions including discharge of patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deteriorates suddenly primarily due to excessive inflammatory injury, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is implicated in endocrine control of the immune system. However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37\% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95\% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Further studies are required to determine whether and how targeting IGF-1 pathway might improve COVID-19 prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6\%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4\% (95\% CI 0.0–3.4\%) to 12.6\% (95\% CI 10.6–14.6\%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5\%, 95\% CI 4.9–8.2\%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3\% (95\% CI 5.7–8.9\%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial worldwide mortality. At present, there is no data regarding oncologist-specific SARS-CoV-2 infection/immunity rates in the United Kingdom (UK) which might impact planning for the management of potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients. Here, we present the first results from the COVID-19 Serology in Oncology Staff (CSOS) study with the aim of informing non-surgical oncology management guidelines. Methods: Patient-facing staff working in an oncology department during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large district general hospital in the East of England were invited to participate. Samples were collected during the first week of June 2020: blood for SARS-COV-2 antibody testing using a rapid lateral flow point of care (POC) assay and a laboratory Luminex based assay, as well as a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Participant characteristics were also collected. Results: Seventy participants were recruited: nurses (45/70; 64.3\%), doctors (15/70; 21.2\%), and other patient-facing staff (10/70; 14.3\%). The majority were female (61/70; 87.1\%) with a mean age of 42 years (median 41; range 23-64 years). A minority were smokers (9/70; 10\%) or had chronic underlying health conditions (16/70; 22.9\%), the commonest being asthma. All participants were nasopharyngeal-swab PCR negative, although 4/70 (5.7\%) had previously tested positive by NHS testing undertaken during the preceding months. 15/70 (21.4\%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Luminex test. Nurses had the highest incidence of positive antibodies (13/45; 28.9\%), with a lower incidence in doctors (2/15; 13.3\%) although this difference was not statistically significant (Fischer9s exact test p=0.3). No receptionists had positive antibody tests. All four participants with a previously reported positive PCR test were antibody-positive. 9/15 (60\%) of antibody-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 3.6-fold higher odds than antibody-negative participants, of whom 16/55 reported symptoms (p=0.03). The mean duration of symptoms was 11 days (median 11; range 1-35 days) and the mean time from resolution of reported previous symptoms to antibody testing was 48.4 days (median 46; range 1-123 days). Conclusion: This study establishes the SARS-CoV-2 exposure and carriage rate amongst patient-facing staff working in the oncology department of a large UK general hospital during the pandemic. These results may help inform UK national oncology patient management prior to the development of a viable vaccine or treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: In the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, Southwest Finland remained relatively spared. By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission. Methods For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson9s chi-square test. Results Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29\% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p\&lt;0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87\% versus 93\%, p=0.09). Discussion OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China.Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3\%) and critical (67.1\%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8\%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients {\textgreater}75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients.Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Advanced age (≥75 yr) was a risk factor for mortality.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Emerging data suggest variability in susceptibility and outcome to Covid-19 infection. Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8\%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15\%) compared to white (5.5\%; P\&lt;.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9\% vs 7.7\%; P\&lt;.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (\&lt;6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9\%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (\&lt;6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a high mortality global pandemic. However, the clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to cytokine storm with organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with COVID-19 would be desirable for management, prioritization for trial enrollment, and risk stratification. We sought to develop a prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Data from the Ontario provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data. Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules \&gt; 0.92 ) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P \&gt; 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question. Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020. Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0\% (one-sided 97.5\% CI = 0-2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3\% (95\% CI = 2.4-9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7\% and 88.1\%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2\% versus 28.0\%, P \&lt;0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0\% (95\% CI = 11.2-23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0\% (95\% CI = 1.1-6.4). Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital of Madrid, with medical diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease, and with symptomatic COVID-19 disease were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. Covariates: sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. RESULTS: 123 patients with IRD and COVID-19 disease were identified and included. We found 54 patients that need hospital admission, 59.2\% were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 69.7 (15.7) years, and a median lag time from symptoms onset to hospital admission of 5 (3-10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6-14) days. A total of 12 patients died (22\%) during their hospital admission. Factors independently associated with hospital admission were being older (OR 1.08; p=0.00), and type of diagnosis (OR 3.55; p=0.01), compared to those who were ambulatory. DMARDs dropped from the model. Male sex, associated comorbidities and glucocorticoids use showed a tendency risk (p\&lt;0.2) CONCLUSION: Our results suggests that age, comorbidities and having an autoimmune systemic condition increased the risk of hospital admission, whereas disease modifying agents were not associated with hospital admission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Its emergence is notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within long term care facilities (LTCFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. LTCF residents tend to possess several risk factors for more severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, including advanced age and multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of LTCFs represent approximately 40\% of SARS-CoV- 2 deaths in the United States.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among LTCF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we collected nasopharyngeal swabs from workers for 8-11 weeks at six Colorado LTCFs, determined the presence and level of viral RNA and infectious virus within these samples, and sequenced 54 nearly complete genomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic infection, a strong correlation between viral RNA and infectious virus, prolonged infections and persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our data suggest that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals contribute to virus persistence and transmission within the workplace, due to high levels of virus.

We did not restrict our search to the English language. Our search retrieved two reports of original research. The relevant publications described transmission and course of infection among residents in LTCFs. Of particular relevance was that large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA could be detected in asymptomatic, presymptomatic and symptomatic residents, providing early evidence of the heterogeneity of infection characteristics among residents at LTCFs. A significant number of LTCF residents were presymptomatic with symptoms emerging 7 days after initial detection of viral RNA, indicating a longer than expected latency period. Therefore, symptomatic screening for early detection and resultant mitigation response was likely to be ineffective in preventing transmission among residents of LTCFs. There were no reports involving longitudinal surveillance testing of LTCF staff.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Added value of this study{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}While prior studies reported results of facility-wide (residents and staff) testing for SARS-CoV-2 and describe transmission dynamics among residents of LTCFs, no prior data was available describing the longitudinal characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics among staff working at LTCFs during a time period where “shelter-in-place” public guidance was in effect. During this time period, LTCF residents were largely isolated, however staff (those with both direct care and those without direct contact) were permitted to leave and return to work daily. We were therefore interested in this broad staff cohort specifically because they represent a significant and ongoing potential source of transmission within LTCFs. RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed weekly on 544 staff in six LTCFs over an 8-11-week period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Symptom data were collected and site-specific prevalence at study onset and incidence rate over time were calculated to explore the influence of identifying and removing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from the workplace.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Implications of all the available evidence{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results document a surprising degree of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic infection among apparently healthy staff, and extreme variation in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and incidence among staff between different facilities. Plaque assay revealed a strong relationship between vRNA and infectious virus in nasopharyngeal swab material, indicating the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals are infectious. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from LTCF staff suggest that the predominant transmission pattern is between staff members within facilities, and that individual unrelated community import events are less common. Finally, decreasing prevalence over time within facilities where longitudinal surveillance testing was performed suggests that identifying and isolating positive staff may serve as part of an effective mitigation program to prevent or curtail transmission among staff within LTCFs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Background
              People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27\%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30\%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15\%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72\%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with \&gt;20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.11–2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.60–0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.01–1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.87–0.98).
            
            
              Conclusions
              We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19 are emerging among US cohorts, but patient trajectories during hospitalization ranging from mild-moderate, severe, and death and the factors associated with these outcomes have been underexplored. Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the Baltimore/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death. Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1\%) were discharged, 113 (13.6\%) died, and 85 (10.2\%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82\%) had mild/moderate and 116 (18\%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95\%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95\%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95\% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95\%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg/dL (aHR 2.79; 95\% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95\%CI 1.53-5.09). In patients under 60, only male sex (aHR 1.7;95\%CI 1.11-2.58), increasing body mass index (BMI) (aHR1.25 1.14-1.37), Charlson score (aHR 1.27; 1.1-1.46) and respiratory rate (aHR 1.16; 95\%CI 1.13-1.2) were associated with severe illness or death. Conclusions: A combination of demographic and clinical features on admission is strongly associated with progression to severe disease or death in a US cohort of COVID-19 patients. Younger patients have distinct risk factors for poor outcomes. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Increasing attention has been paid to cardiac involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7\%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7\% and 86.3\% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3\%) had at least one left-heart and/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0\% (IQR 58.0-69.0\%), with most (44,86.3\%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4\%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5\%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5\%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3\% vs. 23.1\%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3\% vs. 17.9\%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF. Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction was associated with disease severity and increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Italy was the first European country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has the highest number of recorded COVID-19 deaths in Europe. This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6 \%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33–47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1 \%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50–72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7 \% (95 \% CI 14.6–24.9 \%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 \% CI 1.48−2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 \% CI 1.42−6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 \% CI 1.41−48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95 \% CI 1.02−1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 \% CI 1.37−4.87) upon admission. Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 \%. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Objectives COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood. The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease.
Methods Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95\% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed.
Results A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46\%) and 55 (9\%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.39 to 1.06). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed.
Conclusions We found that glucocorticoid exposure of ≥10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease. Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Background:} There is insufficient information about risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse outcomes from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). \textbf{Objectives:} We estimated the association between patients characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico. \textbf{Methods:} This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome. \textbf{Results:} Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0\%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23\% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8\% were hospitalized and 13.0\% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. \textbf{Conclusion:} This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Study design: Cohort study of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) Objectives: To describe the clinical and analytical features of a Covid-19 infected cohort with SCI to contribute new knowledge for a more accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. Setting: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). Methods: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was carried out. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical and radiographic findings were registered. Results: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (5 out 7). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (6 out of 7). The second most common symptom was asthenia (4 out of 7), followed by dyspnea, cough and expectoration (3 out of 7 for each symptom). The MEWS score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in 5 out of 7. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-Rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. Conclusion: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Aims To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications, using electronic health records data, in a geographically defined population in London. Method Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6,309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time on the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and SLAM service use. Results Of 6,309 patients, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95\% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95\% CI 1.14 - 2.72). Conclusions These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: Blacks/African-Americans are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups. Setting: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Participants: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Results: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38\% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2\%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2\%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2\% NHW and 37.4\% NHAA; 44.8\% hospitalized, 20.6\% admitted to ICU, and 3.8\% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95\% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95\% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95\% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95\% CI, 1.62-4.02; P\&lt;.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95\% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004). Conclusions and Relevance: Pre-existing type II diabetes/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide.
Objective To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status.
Methods We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities.
Results The mean age was 48.9 years and 686 (42.7\%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0\% of the study population. 131 (8.2\%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1\%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9\%), followed by diabetes (8.2\%). 130 (8.2\%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95\% CI) 2.681 (1.424–5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03–2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07–2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60–7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95\% CI) was 1.79 (1.16–2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61–4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.
Conclusion Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88\% of patients were Black; and a majority (53\%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 9obese9 range. 97\% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84\%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57\%) and chronic kidney disease (24\%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11\%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age \&gt;60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48\% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87\% died and of the remaining patients, 32\% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3\%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8\%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62\% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33\% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50\% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44\% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5\%] vs 16 [13.2\%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530,\textit{P} \&lt; .001) and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613,\textit{P} \&lt; .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (\textit{P} = .001;\textit{P} \&lt; .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (\textit{P} = .96;\textit{P} = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2\%] vs 69 [51.1\%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6\%] vs 14 [10.4\%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels.

Methods: Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH).
Results: Fifty thousand one hundred and sixty-seven patients with COVID-19 were identiﬁed (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be men, African–American, obese and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nicotine dependence compared with non-PLH cohort (all P values {\textless}0.05). We performed 1 : 1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and sex. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days [risk ratio 1.55, 95\% conﬁdence interval (95\% CI): 1.01–2.39] and were more likely to need inpatient services (risk ratio 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.496–2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (risk ratio 1.33, 95\% CI: 0.69–2.57). A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31 vs. 11.39\%, risk ratio 1.696, 95\% CI: 1.21–2.38). Mean Creactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with a history of antiretroviral treatment.
Conclusion: Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensitymatched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and intensive surveillance are needed to prevent a ‘Syndemic’ of diseases in this vulnerable cohort.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a major global threat that has already caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide. It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFκB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF-α in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Background
              In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have flagged racial and ethnic differences in health outcomes in western countries as an urgent global public health priority. Kuwait has a unique demographic profile with two-thirds of the population consisting of non-nationals, most of which are migrant workers. We aimed to explore whether there is a significant difference in health outcomes between non-Kuwaiti and Kuwaiti patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              We used a prospective COVID-19 registry of all patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in Kuwait who tested positive from February 24th to April 20th, 2020, collected from Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, the officially-designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in the country. We ran separate logistic regression models comparing non-Kuwaitis to Kuwaitis for death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia.
            
            
              Results
              The first 1123 COVID-19 positive patients in Kuwait were all recruited in the study. About 26\% were Kuwaitis and 73\% were non-Kuwaiti. With adjustments made to age, gender, smoking and selected co-morbidities, non-Kuwaitis had two-fold increase in the odds of death or being admitted to the intensive care unit compared to Kuwaitis (OR: 2.14, 95\% CI 1.12–4.32). Non-Kuwaitis had also higher odds of ARDS (OR:2.44, 95\% CI 1.23–5.09) and pneumonia (OR: 2.24, 95\% CI 1.27–4.12).
            
            
              Conclusion
              This is the first study to report on COVID-19 outcomes between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti patients. The current pandemic may have amplified the differences of health outcomes among marginalized subpopulations. A number of socioeconomic and environmental factors could explain this health disparity. More research is needed to advance the understanding of policymakers in Kuwait in order to make urgent public health interventions.},

Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 ± 8.8 yr; 55.1\% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006–2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95\% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52–7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10–16\%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51\% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:
Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized.

METHODS:
Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level {\textgreater}35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared.

RESULTS:
Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2\%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range \{IQR\}] age, 47.0 [35.0–55.0] years; 40.5\% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2–6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7\%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11–16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups.

DISCUSSION:
We found that 28.2\% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels on admission, which could partially be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male patients had a higher risk of liver enzyme level elevation. With early medical intervention, liver enzyme level elevation did not worsen the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Insufficient evidence of factors predicting the COVID-19 progression from mild to moderate to critical has been established. We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for critical progression in Japanese COVID-19 patients. Method: Seventy-four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our hospital between February 20, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We excluded asymptomatic, non-Japanese, and child patients. We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (patients requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors in both groups. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and evaluated risk factors by univariate regression. Results: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1\% male). The median progression time from symptom onset was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2\%), two (3.5\%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (COV: 309 U/l), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980/μl), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression. However, in Cox proportional hazards analysis, lymphocytopenia at symptom onset was not significant. Conclusions: We identified three candidate risk factors for adult Japanese patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: statin use, elevated LDH level, and decreased eGFR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background  There is uncertainty about the associations of angiotensive enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs with COVID-19 disease. We studied whether patients prescribed these drugs had altered risks of contracting severe COVID-19 disease and receiving associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods  This was a prospective cohort study using routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England with 8.28 million participants aged 20–99 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive adjusted HRs for exposure to ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs adjusted for sociodemographic factors, concurrent medications and geographical region. The primary outcomes were: (a) COVID-19 RT-­PCR diagnosed disease and (b) COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU care. Findings  Of 19 486 patients who had COVID-19 disease, 1286 received ICU care. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (adjusted HR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.74) but no increased risk of ICU care (adjusted HR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.06) after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Adjusted HRs for ARBs were 0.63 (95\% CI 0.59 to 0.67) for COVID-19 disease and 1.02 (95\% CI 0.83 to 1.25) for ICU care. There were significant interactions between ethnicity and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for COVID-19 disease. The risk of COVID-19 disease associated with ACE inhibitors was higher in Caribbean (adjusted HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.28) and Black African (adjusted HR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.59) groups than the white group (adjusted HR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.70). A higher risk of COVID-19 with ARBs was seen for Black African (adjusted HR 1.24, 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.58) than the white (adjusted HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.52 to 0.62) group. Interpretation  ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with reduced risks of COVID-19 disease after adjusting for a wide range of variables. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are associated with significantly increased risks of receiving ICU care. Variations between different ethnic groups raise the possibility of ethnic-­specific effects of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity which deserves further study.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potential effective treatment for Covid-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We examined the association between haloperidol use and respiratory failure at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Data were obtained regarding all adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19 since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. We compared outcomes between patients who were exposed to haloperidol and those who were not, using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results: Of the 13,279 hospitalized adult patients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 667 patients (5.0\%) were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 12,612 patients, 104 (0.8\%) were exposed to haloperidol. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint of respiratory failure respectively occurred in 27 patients (26.0\%) exposed to haloperidol and 1,700 patients (13.6\%) who were not. Among survivors, the secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 26 patients (32.1\%) who received haloperidol and 6,110 patients (55.3\%) who did not. In the main analysis, there were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 1.97, p=0.772) and secondary (HR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 1.53, p=0.643) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, haloperidol use was not associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to hospital discharge home. These results suggest that haloperidol is unlikely to have a clinical efficacy for Covid-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Objective
            To examine the association between dexamethasone use and mortality among hospitalized patients for COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study.
          
          
            Setting
            Greater Paris University hospitals, France.
          
          
            Participants
            12,217 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 20 May 2020, including 171 patients (1.4\%) who received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit.
          
          
            Data source
            Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for sex, age, obesity, current smoking status, any medical condition associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, and clinical and biological severity of COVID-19 at admission, while stratifying by the need of respiratory support (i.e., oxygen or intubation). The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model and the secondary analysis used a univariate Cox regression in a matched analytic sample.
          
          
            Results
            Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 10 patients (15.9\%) who received dexamethasone and 298 patients (26.4\%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in both the crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.87, p=0.021) and the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.96, p=0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample yielded a same tendency, albeit non-significant (HR, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.08 to 1.14, p=0.077). Among patients without respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 14 patients (13.0\%) who received dexamethasone and 1,086 patients (10.0\%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. When examining the association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone received during the visit and the endpoint, we found that the administration of a cumulative dose between 60 mg to 150 mg among patients who required respiratory support was significantly associated with a lower risk of death in the crude, unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.28; SE, 0.58, p=0.028), the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.24; SE, 0.65, p=0.030), and in the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample (HR, 0.32; SE, 0.58, p=0.048), whereas no significant association was observed with a different dose. Among patients without respiratory support, there was no significant association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone and the endpoint in the crude and in the adjusted multivariable analyses.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with decreased mortality among those requiring respiratory support.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA$_{\textrm{1c}}$, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Weekly death registrations in the first 19 weeks of 2020 exceeded the corresponding 3-year weekly averages for 2017–19 by 672 (50·9\%) in people with type 1 diabetes and 16 071 (64·3\%) in people with type 2 diabetes. Between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, among 264 390 people with type 1 diabetes and 2 874 020 people with type 2 diabetes, 1604 people with type 1 diabetes and 36 291 people with type 2 diabetes died from all causes. Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10 525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (62·3\%) and 5833 (55·4\%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR {\textless}60 mL/min per 1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$). Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Compared with people with an HbA$_{\textrm{1c}}$ of 48–53 mmol/mol (6·5–7·0\%), people with an HbA$_{\textrm{1c}}$ of 86 mmol/mol (10·0\%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2·23 [95\% CI 1·50–3·30, p{\textless}0·0001] in type 1 diabetes and 1·61 [1·47–1·77, p{\textless}0·0001] in type 2 diabetes). In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA$_{\textrm{1c}}$ of 59 mmol/mol (7·6\%) or higher than in those with an HbA$_{\textrm{1c}}$ of 48–53 mmol/mol (HR 1·22 [95\% CI 1·15–1·30, p{\textless}0·0001] for 59–74 mmol/mol [7·6–8·9\%] and 1·36 [1·24–1·50, p{\textless}0·0001] for 75–85 mmol/mol [9·0–9·9\%]).

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap. Methods: UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, were asked to log symptoms daily from 24th March 2020 to 23rd April 2020. Participants reporting that they did not feel physically normal were taken through a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and any hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the association between current smoking and the development of classic symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity. In addition, association of subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of ACE2, both the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential mediator of disease severity, with smoking status was assessed in a subset of 541 twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Results: Data were available on 2,401,982 participants, mean(SD) age 43.6(15.1) years, 63.3\% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0\%. 834,437 (35\%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to develop symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR[95\%CI] 1.14[1.10 to 1.18]; \&gt;5 symptoms 1.29[1.26 to 1.31]; \&gt;10 symptoms 1.50[1.42 to 1.58]. Smoking was associated with reduced ACE2 expression in adipose tissue (Beta(SE)= -0.395(0.149); p=7.01x10-3). Interpretation: These data are consistent with smokers having an increased risk from COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (\&gt;0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (\&gt;10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (\&gt;75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44\%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56\%) female. 26 (72.22\%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44\%] patients), cough (28 [77.78\%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33\%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22\%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88\%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59\%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65\%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100\%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44\%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78\%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. Design: Case-series. Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City. Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58\%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74\%) were admitted; of these 13 (18\%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24\%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P\&gt;0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95\% CI 0.3-3.2); age \&gt;65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95\% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant \&lt;12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95\% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG\&lt;650 mg/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95\% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95\% CI 1.5-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3\%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7\%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75\% vs 54.2\%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3\% vs 27.8\%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1±12.5 vs 11.5±10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95\%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95\%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95\%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95\%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95\%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To analyze the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. Design: National, cross-sectional study. Setting: Mexico. Participants: 416546 adult patients; 4178 Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 were the primary population under study. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was mortality from COVID-19 up to August 3rd, 2020. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. Results: Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5\% vs 11.1\%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1\%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3\%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7\% vs 1.7\%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95\% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). Conclusions: In the large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. More research is needed regarding the impact of the COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minorities in Mexico.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma with sufficient IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63\%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37\%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13\% vs 55\% (p\&lt;0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p\&lt;0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. Our results suggest that convalescent plasma is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in reported cases of coronavirus disease-19 during the 2020 pandemic, with a first wave during spring followed by the current second wave in late summer and autumn. Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hydroxychloroquine has been touted as a COVID-19 treatment. Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. Objective: To describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study of electronic health records Setting: 13-hospital network spanning the state of New Jersey. Participants: Patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was death. Results: Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22\%), 1539 (61\%) discharges and 426 (17\%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76\%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59\%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95\% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95\% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25\%, 20\%, 18\%, and 20\%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46\% versus 56\%. Conclusions: This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We conducted this retrospective cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4\% Vs. 6.0\%) and mortality (2.3\% Vs. 2.5\%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17) on the 28th day.

The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day. The mortality risk was higher with coronary heart disease (RR=4.54) and CLD (RR=9.66) on the 14th while with diabetes mellitus (RR=3.08, RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=3.14, RR=2.30), CKD (RR=8.97, RR=2.71), and malignant diseases (RR=10.29) on both 14th and 28th day. We must espouse program interventions considering the morbidity and mortality risk factors to condense the aggressive outcomes of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND Smokers are generally more susceptible to infectious respiratory diseases and are at higher risk of developing severe complications from these infections. Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0\% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8\%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4\%, P\&lt;0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND It may take months to years until drugs specifically designed to treat COVID-19 are available. Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel. METHODS CHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID 19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95\% confidence interval (CI), and the p value, using Fisher9s exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS Several drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95\% CI [0.058,0.458], p\&lt;0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95\% CI [0.375,0.688], P\&lt;0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95\% CI [0.645,0.858], p\&lt;0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95\% CI [0.080,0.813], p\&lt;0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization. CONCLUSION Ubiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk. These findings suggest a promising protective effect which should be further investigated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Purpose
              Knowledge regarding patients’ clinical condition at severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is sparse. Data in the international, multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients (LEOSS) cohort study may enhance the understanding of COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models.
            
            
              Results
              
                We included 2155 patients, 59.7\% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was 66–85 years (39.6\%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0\% (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found. Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age [46–65 years: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.73, 95\% CI 1.25–2.42,
                p

                p
                 = 0.040), cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.09–1.72,
                p
                 = 0.007), and diabetes (aOR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.04–1.69,
                p
                 = 0.023) were associated with complicated stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The LEOSS cohort identified age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male sex as risk factors for complicated disease stages at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, thus confirming previous data. Further data regarding outcomes of the natural course of COVID-19 and the influence of treatment are required.},

Methods This is a retrospective study of 6 COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Guizhou Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital ─ a tertial hospital, in Guiyang, Guizhou, China, from January 29, to April 30, 2020; final data of follow-up was May 12, 2020. Through the review of the electronic medical records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three patients with worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with antivirals were transfused convalescent plasma therapy for the first treatment, while the other three severe or critical COVID-19 patients with rapid progression were transfused. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities. Results The PaO2 / FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the lung lesions gradually subsided. The relapsed patients (No. 4 and No. 6), after using convalescent plasma therapy, turned negative on two consecutive throat swab tests on Day 24 and Day 3, respectively. Conclusions Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 is beneficial for those patients with be difficult to turn to negative or re-positive RT-PCR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective The SARS-CoV-2-infected disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings. Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.
Design COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
Results Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4\%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8\% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97\%) and 23 (31.08\%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14\%) and 118 (20.45\%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19\%), 23 (31.08\%), 8 (10.81\%) and 16 (21.62\%) had significantly higher rates of fever {\textgreater}38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86\% and 41.89\% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m6A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.
Conclusion We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            As coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. In this aim, we performed a cohort study to identify predictors of both infections.
          
          
            Methods
            All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls.
          
          
            Results
            Over a two-month study period, we identified among 80 COVID-19, 60 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases, delayed presentation ({\textgreater}3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.89, 95\% confidence interval 1.4-3.40), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95\%CI 2.12-6.82) and anosmia (OR 8.27, 95\%CI 4.39-15.54) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.83, 95\%CI 2.84-16.41), headache (OR 5.38, 95\%CI 1.81-15.94) and retro-orbital pain (OR 7.45, 95\%CI 3.17-17.50) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95\%CI 0.10-0.74).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates.
          
          
            40-word summary of the article’s main point
            In the COVID-19 dengue co-epidemic setting of Reunion island, dengue was found more symptomatic than COVID-19 and associated with body ache, headache and retro-orbital pain, while COVID-19 was found associated with contact, anosmia, delayed presentation and absence of active smoking.},

Graphene—with great mechanical strength, chemical stability, and inherent impermeability—offers a unique 2D system with which to realize this membrane and study the mass transport, if perforated precisely. We report highly efficient mass transfer across physically perforated double-layer graphene, having up to a few million pores with narrowly distributed diameters between less than 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. The measured transport rates are in agreement with predictions of 2D transport theories. Attributed to its atomic thicknesses, these porous graphene membranes show permeances of gas, liquid, and water vapor far in excess of those shown by finite-thickness membranes, highlighting the ultimate permeation these 2D membranes can provide.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Although cardiovascular disease has been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no studies have reported its clinical course in patients with aortic stenosis who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Several observational studies have found an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the O blood group appears to be protective. Objective: To investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Methods: Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcomes were the occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their association with the ABO blood group. Results: Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36\%) died before January 1, 2020, and 20 (1.8\%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Among them, we identified 22 cases (3.1\%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6\%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariate analysis identified the A blood group (versus others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio [OR] = 6.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11−18.92; p=0.001). The A blood group (versus others; OR = 8.27; 95\% CI = 1.83−37.43, p=0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95\% CI = 1.64−15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and/or death). Conclusions: Patients who had undergone TAVR are vulnerable to COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to develop the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Objective: To describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Cohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Setting: 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states. Patients: 2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020. Measurements: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. Results: Ninety-two percent of patients had at least 1 underlying condition; 32\% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 19\% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15\% vasopressors; and 17\% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not associated with either ICU admission or death. Limitation: Data were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality for COVID-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
              Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available.
            
            
              Objective
              The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics—baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms.
            
            
              Methods
              A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
            
            
              Results
              A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6\%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95\% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95\% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95\% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95\% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We developed a machine learning model comprising simple patient-provided characteristics, which can efficiently predict the need for intensive care among patients with COVID-19.},

In order to assess for confounding, we produced - to our knowledge - the first multivariable adjusted estimate of the association of racial characteristics with Covid-19. Our adjusted estimates indicated that black participants remained at over threefold increased risk of Covid-19 relative to white participants. Exploratory analyses identified that 22.9\% of Covid-19 positive black patients were using either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, relative to just 6.7\% of all black participants. Our genetic analyses confirmed the finding of a previous report noting an association of blood type A with Covid-19, and we discovered a novel genetic association with HLA DQA1\_509 that remained significant even after Bonferroni correction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Importance
            Understanding the false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is pivotal for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and it has practical implications for patient management in healthcare facilities.
          
          
            Objective
            To determine the real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.
          
          
            Design
            A retrospective study on case series from 4 March – 15 April 2020.
          
          
            Setting
            A population-based study conducted in primary and tertiary care in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland.
          
          
            Participants
            Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, and who had sufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in their medical records were eligible. All 1,194 inpatients admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. Altogether 83 eligible outpatients (4.6\%) and 3 inpatients (0.3\%) were excluded due to insufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion.
          
          
            Exposures
            High clinical suspicion for COVID-19 was used as the reference standard for the RT-PCR test. Patients were considered to have high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 if the physician in charge recorded the suspicion on clinical grounds, or the patient fulfilled specifically defined clinical and exposure criteria.
          
          
            Main measures
            Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR by using manually curated clinical characteristics as the gold standard.
          
          
            Results
            The study population included 1,814 outpatients (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1\% women) and 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2\% women). The sensitivity (95\% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases, i.e. repeatedly tested patients were as follows: 85.7\% (81.5–89.1\%) inpatients; 95.5\% (92.2–97.5\%) outpatients, 89.9\% (88.2–92.1\%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the following sensitivity values (95\% CI) were observed: 67.5\% (62.9–71.9\%) inpatients; 34.9\% (31.4–38.5\%) outpatients; 47.3\% (44.4–50.3\%) all.
          
          
            Conclusions and relevance
            The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best. The relatively high false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing need to be accounted for in clinical decision making, epidemiological interpretations and when using RT-PCR as a reference for other tests.
          
          
            Key Points
            
              Question
              What is the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test?
            
            
              Findings
              In this population-based retrospective study on medical records of 1,814 outpatients and 1,194 inpatients, the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was 47.3–89.9\%.
            
            
              Meaning
              The false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing need to be accounted for in clinical decision making, epidemiological interpretations and when using RT-PCR as a reference for other tests.},

	abstract = {Background
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening infections. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms.
Methods
We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models.
Results
In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2\% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09\% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74\% by meta-analysis).
Conclusions
More than half of the patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities. Asymptomatic patients may be contagious and thus a potential source of transmission of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety, preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19. Methods Objective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively. Results In control group, 11.7\% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5\% vs 15.6\% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100\% vs 82.3\%) days to stay in hospital ( 6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p\&lt; 0.0001) . Conclusion Results of the study suggest that Guduchi Ghan Vati, a common and widely used Ayurveda preparation, could benefit treating asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) infection and exposure risks among grocery retail workers, and to investigate their mental health state during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20\%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95\% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95\% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score \&gt; 4 or PHQ-9 score \&gt;4) was 24\% and 8\%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.2 (95\% CI 0.1 to 0.7) and 0.1 (95\% CI 0.01 to 0.6) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusions: We found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct costumer exposure were 5 times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while cigarette smokers were 90\% less likely to have positive assays. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 32 adult critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary community hospital in upstate NY, between March 14th and April 12th, 2020. We collected demographic, laboratory, ventilator, and treatment data, which were analyzed and clinical outcomes tabulated. Results: 32 patients admitted to the ICU were included, with mean (±SD) follow-up duration 21 ± 7 days. Mean (±SD) age was 62.2 ± 11.2 years, and 62.5\% were men. 27 (84.4\%) of patients had one or more medical co-morbidities and 50\% of the patients were current or former smokers. The mean (±SD) duration of symptoms was 6.6 (±4.4) days before presentation, with cough (81.3\%), dyspnea (68.7\%), and fever (65.6\%) being most common. 23 (71.9\%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. 5 (15.6\%) had died, 11 (34.4\%) had been discharged home, and 16 (50\%) remained hospitalized, 8 (25\%) of which were still in ICU. Mean (±SD) length of ICU stay was 10.2 (±7.7) days, and mean (±SD) length of hospital stay was 14.8 (±7.7) days. Conclusion: Majority of patients were of older age and with medical co-morbidities. With adequate resource utilization, mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients may not be as high as previously suggested.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective To compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Methods We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. Results Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4\% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0\% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95\%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95\%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model. Conclusions After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods From March 16 to April 30, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center were identiﬁed with laboratory-conﬁrmed or suspected COVID19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records.
Results We identiﬁed 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS, of which 9 had pediatric onset; 17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). Thirty-seven underwent PCR testing and were conﬁrmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84\%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n = 34, 44.7\%) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (n = 10, 13.5\%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1\% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7\%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5\%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a nonambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome.
Conclusions Most patients with MS with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at-risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.},

Between March 3rd and July 18th, 2020, 70,496 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 12,084 (17.1\%) tested positive, of whom 3,536 (29.3\%) were hospitalized. Among positive cases, NHBs and Hispanics were significantly younger than NHWs and Hispanics, respectively (mean age NHBs vs. NHWs: 46.0 vs. 51.7 year and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 44.0 vs. 48.7 years). Despite younger age, NHBs (vs. NHWs) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (25.2\%), hypertension (47.7\%), and chronic kidney disease (5.0\%). Both minority groups resided in lower median income and higher population density areas. In fully adjusted models, NHBs and Hispanics had higher likelihoods of hospitalization, aOR (CI): 1.42 (1.24-1.63) and 1.61 (1.46-1.78), respectively.

	abstract = {Abstract
          COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits wide inter-individual clinical variability, from silent infection to severe disease and death. The identification of high-risk patients is a continuing challenge in routine care. We aimed to identify factors that influence clinical worsening. We analyzed 52 cell populations, 71 analytes, and RNA-seq gene expression in the blood of severe patients from the French COVID cohort upon hospitalization (n = 61). COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and “confirmatory” Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P{\textless} 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P{\textless} 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01). These results highlight neutrophil activation as a hallmark of severe disease and CD177 assessment as a reliable prognostic marker for routine care.},

            Background
            The association between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, established CV disease (CVD), and susceptibility to CV complications or mortality in COVID-19 remains unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We conducted a cohort study of consecutive adults hospitalised for severe COVID-19 between 1
              st
              March and 30
              th
              June 2020. Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained.
            
          
          
            Findings
            Among 1,721 patients (median age 71 years, 57\% male), 349 (20.3\%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6\%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1\%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5\%) patients died: 37\% with CVD, 25.7\% with RF-CVD and 16.5\% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients {\textless}70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95\%CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those ≥70 years (aHR 1.14 [95\%CI 0.77-1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group ({\textless}70y aHR 1.21 [95\%CI 0.72-2.01], ≥70y aHR 1.07 [95\%CI 0.76-1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66\%) versus RF-CVD (17\%) or neither (11\%; p{\textless}0.001). 213 [12.4\%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE.
          
          
            Interpretation
            In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group.},

Methods: We conducted a retrospective single center study including consecutive patients older than 65 years that developed severe COVID19 between March 3 and May 1, 2020 and were treated with corticosteroids at various doses (methylprednisolone [0.5 mg/Kg/12 hours to 250 mg/24 hours]), either alone (CS group) or associated to intravenous tocilizumab (400 to 600 mg, one to three doses) (CS/TCZ group). Primary outcome was all cause mortality by day +14, whereas secondary outcomes included mortality by day +28 and clinical improvement (discharge and/or a 2 point decrease on a six point ordinal scale) by day +14. Propensity score (PS)based adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were applied.
Results: Overall, 181 and 80 patients were included in the CS and CS TCZ groups. All cause 14 day mortality was lower in the CS/TCZ group, both in the PS adjusted (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.68; P value = 0.002) and IPTW weighted models (odds ratio [OR]: 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.21 to 0.68; P value = 0.001). This protective effect was also observed for 28 day mortality (PS adjusted HR: 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.21 to 0.72; P value = 0.003). Clinical improvement by day +14 was higher in the CS/TCZ group in the IPTW analysis only (OR: 2.26; 95\% CI: 1.49 to 3.41; P value {\textless}0.001). The occurrence of secondary infection was similar between both groups.
Conclusions: The combination of corticosteroids and TCZ was associated with better outcomes among patients older than 65 years with severe COVID-19.},

            INTRODUCTION
            Chronological age (CA) is a predictor of adverse COVID-19 outcomes; however, CA alone does not capture individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components.
          
          
            METHODS
            In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge/PhenoAccelAge components.
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              We included 1068 subjects of whom 401 presented critical illness and 204 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO
              2
              and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel{\textgreater}0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p{\textless}0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes.
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features. PhenoAge is a better predictor of adverse outcomes compared to CA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 classified as critical type have not been well described. 
OBJECTIVES This study aimed to described the clinical outcomes and further explored risk factors of in-hospital death for COVID-19 classified as critical type.
METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.
RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9\%) died in hospital, 37(37.8\%) discharged, and 18(18.4\%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2\%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4\%), followed by diabetes (17.3\%), angina pectoris (13.3\%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8\% vs 49.1\%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9\% vs 7.3\%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups. The proportion of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer and cardiac injury marker were 59.4\%, 35.7\%, 87.5\% and 42.9\%, respectively, and all showed the significant difference between two groups. The acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed in 42.9\%, 27.8\% and 26.5\% of the patients. Compared with survivor group, non-survivor group had more acute cardiac injury (79.1\% vs 14.5\%, P{\textless}0.0001), AKI (50.0\% vs 10.9\%, P{\textless}0.0001), and ARDS (37.2\% vs 18.2\%, P=0.034). Multivariable Cox regression showed increasing hazard ratio of in-hospital death associated with acute cardiac injury (HR, 6.57 [95\% CI, 1.89-22.79]) and AKI (HR, 2.60 [95\% CI, 1.15-5.86]).  
CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 classified as critical type had a high prevalence of acute cardiac and kidney injury, which were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.},

We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, and Tongji Hosptial in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6\% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95\% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (n=1031, 47.8\% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted survival curves were close to the observed survival curves across patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS The PLANS model based on the five routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics (platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex) showed excellent discriminative and calibration accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. This prognostic model would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world-wide emergency. Fangcang shelter hospitals have been applied in COVID-19 to ease ongoing shortage of medical resources in Wuhan since February 2020. Methods This study enrolled all cases (no=1848) with mild or moderate type of COVID-19 in Fangcang shelter hospital of Jianghan in Wuhan from Feb 5th to Mar 9th, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the National health commission of China. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs, symptoms and signs were recorded in detail. Laboratory tests included biochemical indicators and nucleic acid tests by throat swabs have been performed as well. Findings A total of 1327 patients reached the criteria of isolation release. Meanwhile, 521 patients have been transferred to the designated hospitals for further treatment, including severe type, fever more than 3 days, and severe comorbidity. The case-severity rate (rate of mild or moderate type transforming to severe type) was 3.0\% in the shelter hospital. The patients from mild or moderate type to severe type showed the following clinical characteristics: the median incubation (onset to shelter) period was 10 days; they were all symptomatic at admission; fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms; hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart diseases were common co-morbidities; most of the patients had elevated levels of CRP at ill onset with 33.3\% over 10 mg per L; bilateral distribution and ground-glass opacity were the most common manifestations in chest CT. Interpretation The potential risk factors of fever, fatigue, high level of C-reactive protein were the risk factors to identify the progression of COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate type. Fangcang shelter hospitals have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms transfer to a designated hospital. Early application of the Fangcang shelter hospital may contribute to decrease the ratio of mild transforming to severe patients.

	abstract = {Background 
        Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.
        Methods 
        Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.
        Results 
        Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1\%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9\%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3\% vs. 3.0\%, χ2 = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5\% vs. 20.9\%, χ2 = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ2 = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628–44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95\% CI: 1.577–25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95\% CI: 1.036–78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95\% CI: 1.942–40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95\% CI: 1.098–50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95\% CI: 1.224−34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.
        Conclusions 
        Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5\%, while 87.8\% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9\%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5\%) and cough (63.4\%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5\%), fever (73.2\%) and cough (41.5\%). There were 95.1\% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5\% and 41.5\%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P\&lt;0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0\% and 11.8\%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2\% and 23.5\%, P\&lt;0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0\% and 23.5\%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have only recently been described, with a paucity of literature reporting the potential relationship between COVID-19 and acute symptomatic seizures. Two prior studies found no clinical or electrographic seizures in their cohorts of COVID-19 patients with altered mental status (AMS) and clinical seizure-like events (SLEs). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 22 critically-ill COVID-19 patients above the age of 18 years who underwent EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring between April 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020 were studied. 19 patients underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours, and 3 patients underwent routine EEGs (\&lt;1 hour). Demographics including age, gender, comorbid medical, and neurological conditions were collected. Clinical variables included EEG findings, anti-seizure medications, discharge disposition, and survival. Findings: 17 patients underwent EEG monitoring for unexplained altered mental status changes and 5 patients underwent monitoring for a seizure-like event. 5 patients had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (4 patients on cEEG, 1 on routine EEG); and only 2 of 5 epileptic EEG patients had a prior history of epilepsy. 2 patients in our cohort had electrographic seizures in the absence of prior epilepsy history. No patients with epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures had acutely abnormal neuroimaging on CT or MRI. Interpretation: Encephalopathic COVID-19 positive patients had a range of EEG abnormalities, and a higher proportion of patients in this series had electrographic seizures than previous literature suggests. This may be influenced by the duration of monitoring with cEEG and the use of a 21 channel electrode system. cEEG findings may help to guide antiseizure medical therapy, as well as the workup of altered mental status in the setting of unremarkable neuroimaging. Funding: No funding was used for this study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Organ graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are likely to be at heighted risk for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes including death. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this vulnerable population and identify therapeutic strategies that are safe. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 adult kidney transplant patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and managed in New York State, the epicenter of Covid-19 pandemic. The patients were evaluated by video visits, phone interviews, or in the Emergency Room for respiratory illness symptoms consistent with Covid-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Characteristics of the patients were stratified by hospitalization status and disease severity. Clinical course including alterations in immunosuppressive therapy were retrieved from their electronic medical records. Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46\% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11\% of hospitalized patients and 64\% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61\% hospitalized patients and 0\% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38\% vs. 40\%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79\% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51\% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67\% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33\% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8\%). Three of 39 (8\%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives To determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China. Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved. Results Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6\%] males), 37 (5.9\%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40\%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7\%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6\%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P \&lt; .0001, P = 0.0003, P \&lt; .0001, and P \&lt; .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P \&lt; .0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0\%, Chi-square test P \&lt; 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4\%, Chi-square test P \&lt; 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6\%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P \&lt; 0.001). Conclusions Elderly (≥65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Despite limited and conﬂicting evidence, hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is widely used in COVID-19 therapy.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of electronic health records of patients hospitalized with conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in US Veterans Health Administration medical centers between March 9, 2020 and April 29, 2020. Patients hospitalized within 24 h of diagnosis were classiﬁed based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) or no HC as treatments. The primary outcomes were mortality and use of mechanical ventilation. Findings: A total of 807 patients were evaluated. Compared to the no HC group, after propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.83; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.16–2.89; p = 0.009), but not in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.80–2.15; p = 0.28). Both the propensity-score-adjusted risks of mechanical ventilation and death after mechanical ventilation were not signiﬁcantly different in the HC group (aHR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.78–1.82; p = 0.42 and aHR, 2.11; 95\% CI, 0.96–4.62; p = 0.06, respectively) or in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.72–1.66; p = 0.69 and aHR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.59–2.68; p = 0.56, respectively) compared to the no HC group.
Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, this retrospective study did not identify any signiﬁcant reduction in mortality or in the need for mechanical ventilation with hydroxychloroquine treatment with or without azithromycin.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results: Mean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9 and 7.8\% (8/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p\&lt;0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31\% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3\% (p=0.02). Conclusion: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80\% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background Loss of smell and taste are commonly reported symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in people with acute loss of smell and/or taste is unknown. The study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a community-based population with acute loss of smell and/or taste and to compare the frequency of COVID-19 associated symptoms in participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection. Methods and findings Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19–related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD ± 12.0) and 69.1\% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1\%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19–related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6\% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8\% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4\% versus 78.7\%, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2\% versus 89.0\%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95\% CI 1.27–6.36; p {\textless} 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19. Conclusions Our findings suggest that recent loss of smell is a highly specific COVID-19 symptom and should be considered more generally in guiding case isolation, testing, and treatment of COVID-19.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective: Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. Research Design and Methods: In this observational cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was hospital mortality and the main predictor was hyperglycemia (any blood glucose ≥7.78 mmol/L during hospitalization). Results: Of 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 228 (57\%) developed hyperglycemia. Of these, 83 (21\%) had hyperglycemia without diabetes. A total of 51 (12.7\%) patients died. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes/no-hyperglycemia patients the no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients showed higher mortality (1.8\% versus 20.5\%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95\% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), p \&lt; 0.001); improved prediction of death (p=0.0162) and faster progression to death (p=0.0051). Hyperglycemia within the first 24 and 48 hours was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). Further, compared to the same reference group, no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients had higher risk of ICU admission (p\&lt;0.001), mechanical ventilation (p\&lt;0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (p\&lt;0.001) and a longer hospital stay in survivors (p\&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Hyperglycemia in the absence of diabetes was common (21\% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of poor prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We conducted a national retrospective cohort in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. To develop the model, we included 264,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 28 and May 30, 2020. To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95\%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we analyse the frequency of CI in deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes. Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30\%: 21.1\% dementia; 8.9\% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often. Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since the first case of pneumonia was described, SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease [COVID]-19) rapidly spread worldwide With 94,288 infections and more than 10,000 deaths, Mexico is the third Latin-American country in number of confirmed cases and second in mortality1. A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3. Thus, policies for reducing obesity and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are most needed to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction: Hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in Mexico is high (32\%) and as of today, effective treatment options are limited. More effective treatments that shorten hospital stay and reduce mortality are needed. Initial reports for the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 appear promising. We describe a case series of eight patients with impending respiratory failure, who underwent CP therapy. Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers {\textgreater} 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for {\textgreater} 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg/dL vs. 1.63 mg/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng/mL vs. 0.13 ng/mL). High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower, and a mild reduction of pulmonary infiltrates by chest X-ray was observed. Lastly, a reduction of viral load was after CP therapy was found. (log, median [IQR], 1.2 [0.70-2.20] vs. 0.25 [0.00-1.78]). We observed no adverse effects. Conclusions: CP could potentially be an effective therapeutic option for patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical benefit needs to be studied further through randomized controlled trials.

	abstract = {Background The use of computed tomography (CT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in an area of northern Italy with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have identified more patients with this disease than RT-PCR in the very early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1\%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8\%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9\%, the mortality rate was 18.8\%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression. Admittedly, the sample of patients in our study was heterogeneous regarding the oncological disease, their prognosis, and the type of treatment; therefore, other studies are needed to confirm our data.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important for deciphering mechanisms of host responses and interpreting disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation-landscape in COVID-19 disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (≥2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05\%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31\%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with ≥2 LTCs had 48\% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and ≥2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response increased risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI ≥40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05\%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {After months of restrictive containment efforts to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, European countries are planning to reopen. To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7\% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy. NCT04370067, 30.04.2020.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. Objective: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. Results: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2\% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5\% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5\% were Hispanic, and 12.8\% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3\% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2\% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (compared to non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency were associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with both hospitalization and disease severity. Conclusion: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19. It also finds clinical risk factors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 not previously identified such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background. COVID-19 pandemic poses a burden on hospital resources and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. This study aimed to provide a scoring system that, assessed upon first-contact evaluation at the emergency department, predicts the need for ICU admission. Methods. We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City between March 16th and May 21st, and split them into development and validation cohorts. Patients were segregated into a group that required admission to ICU, and a group that never required ICU admission and was discharged from hospitalization. By logistic regression, we constructed predictive models for ICU admission, including clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings from the emergency department evaluation. The ABC-GOALS score was created by assigning values to the weighted odd ratios. The score was compared to other COVID-19 and pneumonia scores through the area under the curve (AUC). Results. We included 569 patients divided into development (n=329) and validation (n=240) cohorts. One-hundred-fifteen patients from each cohort required admission to ICU. The clinical model (ABC-GOALSc) included sex, obesity, the Charlson comorbidity index, dyspnea, arterial pressure, and respiratory rate at triage evaluation. The clinical plus laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl) added serum albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and S/F ratio to the clinical model. The model that included imaging (ABC-GOALSclx) added the CT scan finding of \&gt;50\% lung involvement. The model AUC were 0.79 (95\%CI 0.74-0.83) and 0.77 (95\%CI 0.71-0.83), 0.86 (95\%CI 0.82-0.90) and 0.87 (95\%CI 0.83-0.92), 0.88 (95\%CI 0.84-0.92) and 0.86 (95\%CI 0.81-0.90) for the clinical, laboratory and imaging models in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The ABC-GOALScl and ABC-GOALSclx scores outperformed other COVID-19 and pneumonia-specific scores. Conclusion. The ABC-GOALS score is a tool to evaluate patients with COVID-19 at admission to the emergency department, which allows to timely predict their risk of admission to an ICU.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cancer patients with COVID-19 are likely to have a greater risk of complications and death. A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR method. The mean age was 55.3 years (SD 21.1). The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1\%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3\%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2\%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11\%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5\%]) predominated. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7\%]), septic shock (40 [22.1\%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2\%]). A total of 60 (33.1\%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. By multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p \&lt;0.001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. This is the first study in a cohort of Brazilian cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: Racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have been amplified during this pandemic and reports on outcomes in African-American (AA) populations, known to have higher rates of cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities, remain limited. Objective: To examine prevalence of comorbidities, rates of hospitalization and survival, and incidence of CV manifestations of COVID-19 in a predominantly AA population in south metropolitan Chicago. Design, Setting, Participants: This was an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients encountered from March 16 to April 16, 2020 at the University of Chicago. Deidentified data were obtained from an institutional data warehouse. Group comparisons and logistic regression modeling based on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic testing was performed. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab testing and clinical management was at the discretion of treating physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included incident CV manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of overall cardiology service utilization. Results: During the 30 day study period, 1008 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 689 had available encounter data. Of these, 596 (87\%) were AA and 356 (52\%) were hospitalized, of which 319 (90\%) were AA. Age \&gt; 60 years, tobacco use, BMI \&gt;40 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) were more common in hospitalized patients. Age \&gt; 60 years, tobacco use, CAD, and AF were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality along with several elevated initial laboratory markers including troponin, NT-proBNP, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin. Despite this, cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 were uncommon, coincident with a 69\% decrease in cardiology service utilization. For hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4-11.9 days) and mortality was 13\%. AA patients were more commonly hospitalized, but without increased mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this AA-predominant experience from south metropolitan Chicago, CV comorbidities and chronic diseases were highly prevalent and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality. Insulin-requiring DM and CKD emerged as novel predictors for hospitalization. Despite the highest rate of comorbidities reported to date, CV manifestations of COVID-19 and mortality were relatively low. The unexpectedly low rate of mortality merits further study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Identification of prognostic factors in COVID-19 remains a global challenge. The role of smoking is still controversial. Objective: To evaluate the rate of daily smokers in patients with COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 in-and outpatients from a large French university hospital were systematically interviewed for their smoking status, use of e-cigarette and nicotinic substitutes. The rates of daily smokers in in-and outpatients were compared to those in the 2019 French general population, after standardization for sex and age. Results: The inpatient group was composed of 340 patients, median age 66 years: 203 men (59.7\%) and 137 women (40.3\%), median age for both 66 years, with a daily smokers rate of 4.1 \% CI95\% [2.3-6.9] (5.4\% of men, 2.2\% of women). The outpatient group was composed of 139 patients, median age 44 years: 62 men (44.6\%, median age 43 years), and 77 women (55.4\%, median age 44 years). The daily smoker rate was 6.1 \% CI 95\% [2.7-11.6] (5.1\% of men, 6.8\% of women). In the 2019 French population, the daily smoker rate was 24.0\% (27.5\% of men, 20.7\% of women). Among inpatients, daily smokers represented 2.2\% and 3.4\% of the 45 dead patients and of the 29 patients transferred to ICU, respectively. The rate of daily smokers was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients, as compared to that in the French general population after standardization by age and sex, with Standardized Incidence Ratios of 0.24 [0.12-0.48] for outpatients and 0.24 [0.14-0.40] for inpatients. Conclusion: Daily smokers rate in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 is lower as compared to the general population{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: The study population included the 14,000 members of Leumit Health Services who were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for plasma 25(OH)D level. "Suboptimal" or "low" plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below 30 ng/mL. Results: Of 7,807 individuals, 782 (10.1\%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7,025 (89.9\%) COVID-19-negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19.00 ng/mL (95\% confidence interval [CI] 18.41-19.59) vs. 20.55 (95\% CI 20.32-20.78)]. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.58 (95\% CI 1.24-2.01, p\&lt;0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2.09 (95\% CI 1.01-4.30, p\&lt;0.05)]. In multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables and psychiatric and somatic disorders, the adjusted OR of COVID-19 infection [1.45 (95\% CI 1.08-1.95, p\&lt;0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1.95 (95\% CI 0.98-4.845, p=0.061)] were preserved. In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection; age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rational: Recently, a new Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale is recommended in the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. Aim of the study: To assess the Post COVID-19 functional status in Egypt and to evaluate if age, gender, comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics or by calls and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale in paper or online forms as well as their demographic and clinical data. Results: 80\% of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1\%), slight (14.4\%), moderate (2\%) to severe (0.5\%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P= 0.003), gender (P= 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P \&lt;0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P\&lt;0.001), need for ICU admittance (P= 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P\&lt;0.001), smoking status (P \&lt; 0.001) and lastly the presence of any comorbid disorder (P \&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and lastly the presence of coexisting comorbidity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Materials and Methods: A retrospective, observational cohort study of 112 inpatient adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12 and April 16, 2020. Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV. Results: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66\% male. In-hospital mortality was 6\% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8\% (6/47), and 18\% (5/28) for those requiring IMV. Obesity (OR 5.82, CI 1.74-19.48), former (OR 8.06, CI 1.51-43.06) and current smoking status (OR 10.33, CI 1.43-74.67) were associated with IMV after adjusting for age, sex, and high prevalence comorbidities by multivariable analysis. Initial absolute lymphocyte count (OR 0.33, CI 0.11-0.96), procalcitonin (OR 1.27, CI 1.02-1.57), IL-6 (OR 1.17, CI 1.03-1.33), ferritin (OR 1.05, CI 1.005-1.11), LDH (OR 1.57, 95\% CI 1.13-2.17) and CRP (OR 1.13, CI 1.06-1.21), were associated with IMV by univariate analysis.

Inflammation affects atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and promotes a thrombogenic environment. We report a series of 6 patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to intraluminal carotid artery thrombus presenting during an 8-day period. Six patients were included (5 men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55–78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had vascular risk factors including diabetes (83\%), hyperlipidemia (100\%), and smoking (17\%). Four patients presented with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores of 24–30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5 patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke.},

The function of temporally regulated centromeric transcription, and transcripts, is consequently a topic of intense investigation. In this study, we use high throughput approaches to identify and describe lncRNAs associated with the centromere specific histone variant CENP-A that arise from the transcription of specific centromeres at early G1, which we then show are physically associated with centromeres, and which are functionally necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. Targeted depletion of one such centromeric RNA, which originates from a single centromere, is sufficient to increase the frequency of chromosome segregation defects. These data support the emerging paradigm of the necessity of centromere-specific lncRNAs in the integrity of faithful chromosome segregation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To investigate severe COVID-19 risk by occupational group. Methods: Baseline UK Biobank data (2006-10) for England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020). Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged less than 65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification 2000). Results: Of 120,075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95\% CI:5.52,10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95\% CI:1.21,2.82) and other essential workers (RR=1.60, 95\% CI:1.05,2.45) had higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95\% CI:4.87,15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95\% CI:1.47,4.14) and transport workers (RR= 2.20, 95\% CI:1.21,4.00) had highest risk within the broader groups. Compared to white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (RR 3.27, 95\% CI: 1.90,5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (RR 8.34, 95\% CI:5.17,13.47). Using SOC2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had higher risk, compared to managers and senior officials. Conclusions: Essential workers have higher risk of severe COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for national and organizational policies and practices that protect and support workers with elevated risk of severe COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Risk stratification of COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission is key for their successful treatment and efficient utilization of hospital resources. Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with ventilation need and mortality. Design, setting and participants: We established a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients from Mass General Brigham hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and admission laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before May 19th, 2020. Using patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, derivation cohort), multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to construct the Ventilation in COVID Estimator (VICE) and Death in COVID Estimator (DICE) risk scores. Measurements: The primary outcomes were ventilation status and death. Results: The entire cohort included 1042 patients (median age, 64 years; 56.8\% male). The derivation and validation cohorts for the risk scores included 578 and 464 patients, respectively. We found seven factors to be independently predictive for ventilation requirement (diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, alanine aminotransferase, troponin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase), and 10 factors to be predictors of in-hospital mortality (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic statin use, albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, and procalcitonin). Using these factors, we constructed the VICE and DICE risk scores, which performed with C-statistics of at least 0.8 in our cohorts. Importantly, the chronic use of a statin was associated with protection against death due to COVID-19. The VICE and DICE score calculators have been placed on an interactive website freely available to the public (https://covid-calculator.com/). Limitations: One potential limitation is the modest sample sizes in both our derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusion: The risk scores developed in this study may help clinicians more appropriately determine which COVID-19 patients will need to be managed with greater intensity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Observational studies have consistently described poor clinical outcomes and increased ICU mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require mechanical ventilation (MV). Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. Results Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2\%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 49.5-71.5]; 35.1\% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1\%), and diabetes (54; 41.2\%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2\%) required MV and 9 (6.9\%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p\&lt; 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p\&lt; 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p \&lt; 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8\% and 23.8\% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6\% and 26.5\% respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasize the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During the first pandemic wave Covid-19 reached Latin America cities. Aim: To report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied. Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8\% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients ≥60 years old predominated (57.1\%). Hypertension (61.9\%), obesity (57.1\%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1\%) were prevalent but 19\% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19\% at 1st week; 42.9\% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9\%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5\%) and length of stay was equal or higher than 14 days in 57.9\% of patients. Conclusion: In our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality. Tachypnea ≥30/min is predictive of transfer to ICU.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

PLAB2 marks correlated with MRCP(UK) PACES and MRCGP CSA (r=0.274, 0.321; both P\&lt;0.001). PLAB graduates had significantly lower MRCP(UK) and MRCGP assessments (Glass’s Δ=0.94, 0.91, 1.40, 1.01, and 1.82 for MRCP(UK) Part 1, Part 2, and PACES and MRCGP AKT and CSA), and were more likely to fail assessments and to progress more slowly than UK medical graduates. IELTS scores correlated significantly with later performance, multiple regression showing that the effect of PLAB1 (β=0.496) was much stronger than the effect of IELTS (β=0.086). Changes to PLAB pass marks that would result in international medical graduate and UK medical graduate equivalence were assessed in two ways. Method 1 adjusted PLAB pass marks to equate median performance of PLAB and UK graduates. Method 2 divided PLAB graduates into 12 equally spaced groups according to PLAB performance, and compared these with mean performance of graduates from individual UK medical schools, assessing which PLAB groups were equivalent in MRCP(UK) and MRCGP performance to UK graduates. The two methods produced similar results. To produce equivalent performance on the MRCP and MRGP examinations, the pass mark for PLAB1 would require raising by about 27 marks (13\%) and for PLAB2 by about 15-16 marks (20\%) above the present standard.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Conclusions} PLAB is a valid assessment of medical knowledge and clinical skills, correlating well with performance at MRCP(UK) and MRCGP. PLAB graduates’ knowledge and skills at MRCP(UK) and MRCGP are over one standard deviation below those of UK graduates, although differences in training quality cannot be taken into account. Equivalent performance in MRCGP(UK) and MRCGP would occur if the pass marks of PLAB1 and PLAB2 were raised considerably, but that would also reduce the pass rate, with implications for medical workforce planning. Increasing IELTS requirements would have less impact on equivalence than raising PLAB pass marks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background \& aims
New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities.
Methods
This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
Results
200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76\%), hyperlipidemia (46.2\%), and diabetes (39.5\%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86\%), cough (76.5\%), and dyspnea (68\%) were the three most common symptoms. 24\% died during hospitalization (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2: 31.6\%, BMI 25–34 kg/m2: 17.2\%, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2: 34.8\%, p = 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95\% CI: 1.45–9.83; p = 0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95\% CI: 1.25–5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95\% CI: 1.13–2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation.
Conclusions
In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction Use of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia has been greatly debated around the world due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission and delays in invasive mechanical Ventilation (IMV). Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Results Of the 837 patients with COVID-19, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8 (±13.6) years, BMI 32.6 (±8), 58 (45 \%) were female, 72 (55.8\%) were African American, 40 (31\%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2\%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days (± 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p \&lt;0.0001). ΔROX (\&lt;=0 versus \&gt;0), peak D-dimer \&gt;4000 and admission GFR \&lt; 60 ml/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=). Mortality was 11.2\% in HFNT only group versus 47.5\% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p,0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group. Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: A multicentre, single-arm, hypothesis-driven phase 2 trial was planned to study the effect of Tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints). A cohort of patients consecutively enrolled after phase 2 was used as a validation dataset. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate hypotheses, while controlling for possible confounders. Results: out of 301 patients in phase 2 intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 180 (59.8\%) received tocilizumab. With 67 death events, lethality rates were 18.4\% (97.5\%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4\% (97.5\%CI: 17.2-28.3, P\&lt;0.001) at 14 and 30 days. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, including 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. The multivariable logistic regression suggests tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. Also, it supports a positive effect on lethality rate of the use of corticosteroids. Conclusions: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Such result support the use of tocilizumab while waiting for ongoing phase 3 trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Preventing communicable diseases requires understanding the spread, epidemiology, clinical features, progression, and prognosis of the disease. Early identification of risk factors and clinical outcomes might help to identify critically ill patients, provide proper treatment and prevent mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19. Interpretation: Finding clinical symptoms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical part of prevention. These symptoms can help in the assessment of disease progression. To the best of our knowledge, some of the effective features on the mortality due to COVID-19 are investigated for the first time in this research. Funding: None{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Aim To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in May-June 2020 after the lockdown in adults living in three regions in France and to identify the associated risk factors. Methods Participants in a survey on COVID-19 from an existing consortium of three general adult population cohorts living in the Ile-de-France (IDF) or Grand Est (GE), two regions with high rate of COVID-19, or in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine (NA), with a low rate, were asked to take a dried-blood spot (DBS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment. The primary outcome was a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the spike protein of the virus (ELISA-S). The secondary outcomes were a positive ELISA IgG against the nucleocapsid protein (ELISA-NP), anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titers \&gt;=40 (SN), and predicted positivity obtained from a multiple imputation model (MI). Prevalence estimates were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification methods. Findings Between May 4, 2020 and June 23, 2020, 16,000 participants were asked to provide DBS, and 14,628 were included in the analysis, 983 with a positive ELISA-S, 511 with a positive ELISA-NP, 424 with SN\&gt;=40 and 941 (Standard Deviation=31) with a positive MI. Adjusted estimates of seroprevalence (positive ELISA-S) were 10.0\% (95\%CI 9.1\%;10.9\%) in IDF, 9.0\% (95\%CI 7.7\%; 10.2\%) in GE and 3.1\% (95\%CI 2.4\%; 3.7\%), in NA. The adjusted prevalence of positive ELISA-NP, SN and MI were 5.7\%, 5.0\% and 10.0\% in IDF, 6.0\%, 4.3\% and 8.6\% in GE, and 0.6\%, 1.3\% and 2.5\% in NA, respectively. A higher seroprevalence was observed in younger participants and when at least one child or adolescent lived in the same household. A lower seroprevalence was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers.

With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68\% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and \&gt;=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p\&lt;0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and ≥75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

            Introduction
            Long-term effects of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and their sustainability in a large number of patients are of the utmost relevance. We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those characteristics associated with worse CPET performance.
          
          
            Methods
            We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed.
          
          
            Results
            Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (\%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)\%. Thirty-eight(34.5\%) patients had \%pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5\%) above the 85\% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits.
            Eight(21.1\%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7\%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9\%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4\%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6\%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with \%pVO2 (p{\textgreater}0.05).
            Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age (β=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss (β=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status (β=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay (β=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength (β=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with \%pVO2.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Half of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.
          
          
            Take-home messages
            at 3-month cardiopulmonary exercise testing 38/110(34.5\%) non-severe COVID-19 survivors had percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (\%pVO2) {\textless} 85\% (indicating normality). Half of them had functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment.},

We conducted logistic regression analyses of the UK Biobank prospective study of 0.5 million adults followed for an average of 11 years. Compared to women, men were more likely to be tested and to test positive. In sex-stratified analyses, current smokers had higher adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) for being tested (male OR 1.60, 95\%CI 1.32-1.95 and female OR 1.50, 1.21-.1.86). Current smokers were more slightly more likely than never smokers to test positive for COVID-19. Further examination of smoking as a risk factor for COVID-19 is required. These must take into account reverse causality, where smokers quit to avoid disease as well as prior diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background and Aims: The abnormal liver function and even liver failure related death were reported in the COVID-19 patients, but less of studies focus on the dynamic liver function changes. We analysed the liver function indexes of COVID-19 patients to explore the characteristics of liver function changes in patients with different severity. Methods: This study included 54 moderate, 50 severe, and 31 death nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan, China. Epidemiological histories, clinical features, imaging materials, medications and especially major liver function laboratory tests were collected for analysis. Results: The clinical symptoms did not present any significant difference in the patients at admission, but the older male patients had pronounced mortality risk. The normal ratio of ALT, TB, and DBIL of moderate patients was 96.3\%, 94.44\%, and 98.15\% separately at the first test, but 59.26\% of patients showed declined ALB levels. The normal ratio of all liver function indexes declined after admission, but most abnormalities were mild (1-2 times of upper limit unit) and went back normal before discharge. In severe patients, the normal ratio of ALB dropped down to 30.61\% at admission along with the dramatic impaired normal ratio of bilirubin at the second test. The severe patients liver function dysfunction was worse than the moderate patients but without a significant difference. The dead patients showed a significantly higher level of DBIL, AST, GGT and CRP than other groups patients in the final test, along with the hypoalbuminemia. What is worse, 16.13\% of non-survivors were diagnosed with liver failure. No medication was found to be related to ALT, AST, and GGT abnormality in our study. Conclusion: In moderate and severe patients, liver dysfunction was mild. Patients widely presented lower level of ALB. The higher level of bilirubin, AST, and GGT was likely to indicate the worse outcome. Dynamic monitoring of liver function indexes could be considered and liver failure related death should be noticed and prevented in the early stage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40\%) were male, and 21/40(52.5\%) were African American. 19/40(47.5\%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5\%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15\%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3\%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0\%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1/14[7.14\%] and 5/14[35.7\%] vs mild:0/19[0\%] and 1/19[5.26\%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26\%) mild course-patients, but was in 9/15(60\%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3\%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5\%], moderate:12/15[80\%] and severe:3/6[50\%], P=0.123). Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
            SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          
          
            Methods
            
              A double-blinded, randomized, prospective, investigational study of dutasteride for the treatment of COVID-19 (
              NCT04446429
              ). Subjects confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 were treated in an outpatient setting. Endpoints for the study were remission times for a predetermined set of symptoms: fever or feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain/ache, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, nasal discharge (runny nose), nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and loss of taste or smell (Ageusia or Anosmia).
            
          
          
            Results
            A total of 130 SARS-CoV-2 positive men were included in the study, 64 subjects in the dutasteride arm and 66 subjects in the placebo-controlled group. The differences in the average remission times for fatigue and anosmia or ageusia was statistically different between the groups (5.8 versus 10.1 days for fatigue and 7.3 versus 13.4 days for anosmia or ageusia, in dutasteride and placebo groups, respectively), however, the total remission time was significantly reduced for the men given dutasteride; 9.0 days versus 15.6 days in the placebo group (p {\textless} 0.001). Excluding loss of taste and smell the average total remission time was 7.3 days in the dutasteride group versus 11.7 in the placebo arm (p {\textless} 0.001).
          
          
            Conclusion
            The total remission time for men using 5ARis was significantly reduced compared to men not taking 5ARis.},

              Does smoking decrease the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 because the never-smokers (84\%) prevalence is high and the current-smokers prevalence is low among COVID-19 positive patients?
              1,2,3,4,5,6
              We sought to determine whether never smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 50 to 69-year old patients because they are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.
              7
            
          
          
            Method
            We conducted a retrospective chart review of COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction, in-hospital tested ≥18-year-old patients. A Poisson regression analysis stratified into never-smokers and history of smoking (current + former smokers) was conducted.
          
          
            Results
            277 COVID-19 negative and 117 COVID-19 positive patients’ charts with a never-smokers prevalence of 42.32\% and 54\% respectively were analyzed. The never-smokers prevalence was 54\%, 20-39-years; 61 \%, 40 -49-years; 41\%, 50 – 69-years; and 43\%, 70 – 100-years.
            The 40-49-year-old current and former smokers were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 [1.309 (1.047 - 1.635)], unlike the 40-49-year-old never-smokers [0.976 (0.890-1.071)] who had a lower risk.
            Regardless of their smoking status, males [1.084(1.021 - 1.151)] and the 50-69-year-old patients [1.082 (1.014 -1.154)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, while end stage renal disease [0.908(0.843-0.978)] and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.907 (0.863 - 0.953)] patients had a lower risk of COVID-19 positivity.
            Heart failure [0.907 (0.830 - 0.991)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [0.842 (0.745 - 0.952)] and Parkinson’s disease [0.823 (0.708 - 0.957)] never-smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19.
          
          
            Conclusion
            This is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 40-49-year-old patients, while not smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the heart failure, COPD and Parkinson’s disease patients. This study emphasizes that COVID-19 positivity risk is not reduced by smoking and not increased by not smoking.},

              Clinical features and natural history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) differ widely among different countries and during different phases of the pandemia. Here, we aimed to evaluate the case fatality rate (CFR) and to identify predictors of mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals of Northern Italy between March 1 and April 28, 2020. All these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular methods. During the study period 504/1697 patients died; thus, overall CFR was 29.7\%. We looked for predictors of mortality in a subgroup of 486 patients (239 males, 59\%; median age 71 years) for whom sufficient clinical data were available at data cut-off. Among the demographic and clinical variables considered, age, a diagnosis of cancer, obesity and current smoking independently predicted mortality. When laboratory data were added to the model in a further subgroup of patients, age, the diagnosis of cancer, and the baseline PaO

Research on IgG seroprevalence among health care workers (HCWs) is needed to re-evaluate health policies. This study was performed in three pandemic hospitals in Istanbul and Kocaeli. Different clusters of HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity rate among participants was evaluated by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. We recruited 813 non-infected and 119 PCR-confirmed infected HCWs. Of the previously undiagnosed HCWs, 22 (2.7\%) were seropositive. Seropositivity rates were highest for cleaning staff (6\%), physicians (4\%), nurses (2.2\%) and radiology technicians (1\%). Non-pandemic clinic (6.4\%) and ICU (4.3\%) had the highest prevalence. HCWs in high risk group had similar seropositivity rate with no risk group (2.9 vs 3.6 p=0.7), indicating the efficient implementation of protection measures in the hospitals in Turkey. These findings might lead to the re-evaluation of infection control and transmission dynamics in hospitals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Hospital admission provides a special opportunity to identify smokers, and treatment of smoking in hospitalised patients is particularly effective.
Objectives: We hypothesised that smoking prevalence is higher in people admitted to hospital compared to the general UK population, and higher in specific subgroups, such as emergency admissions.
Methods: A British Thoracic Society online survey was used by hospitals, who randomly selected elective and emergency admissions under surgery and medicine, and retrospectively reviewed their case notes. Documentation of smoking status and treatment was recorded.
Results: 146 institutions participated with 14,750 patient records submitted. Smoking status was recorded in 73\% of cases. Smoking prevalence in UK hospital admissions was 25\% (28\% in males; 23\% in females), significantly higher than the national average of 19\% in Great Britain1 (p{\textless}0.0001). The prevalence was highest in patients under 45 years of age (42\%). Smoking prevalence in emergency admissions (27\%) was higher than in elective admissions (19\%). Smoking prevalence was also higher in respiratory patients (30\%) than in other medical and surgical specialties. Of 2716 smokers only 28\% were offered treatment, and under 6\% received hospital based treatment for tobacco dependence.
Conclusions: This is the first UK wide study to measure real time smoking prevalence in hospitals. Smoking prevalence is significantly higher in people admitted to hospital than the general UK population. It is especially high in younger adults and emergency admissions. With at least 1 in 4 patients being current smokers, hospitalisation represents a unique opportunity to treat tobacco addiction.

In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98\% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32\% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5\% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from “current smoker” to “never smoker”). Overall, only 2.9\% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4\% were documented as “unknown” or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.},

	abstract = {Background There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? Methods and findings We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3\%–67\% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31\% (95\% CI 26\%–37\%, prediction interval 24\%–38\%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95\% CI 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. Conclusions The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.},

This article describes the first 2226 adult patients with COVID-19, consecutively admitted to La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. Methods: Our cohort included all patients consecutively hospitalized who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from 25 February (first case admitted) to 19 April 2020. The data were manually entered into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. Results: We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients’ median age was 61 years, and 51.8\% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3\%), and the most common symptom on admission was fever (71.2\%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. The overall mortality was 20.7\% and was higher in men (26.6\% vs. 15.1\%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) (3.4\%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile. Conclusions: We provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male sex, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95\%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95\%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients. Interpretation:Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. Funding:National Science and Technology Major Project.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Many different treatments were heavily administered to patients with COVID-19 during the peak of the pandemic in Madrid without robust evidence supporting them. Methods We examined the association between sixteen treatments in four groups (steroids, antivirals, antibiotics and immunomodulators) and intubation or death. Data were obtained from patients that were admitted to an HM hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 until 24/04/2020, excluding unconfirmed diagnosis, those who were admitted before the epidemic started in Madrid, had an outcome that was not discharge or death or died within 24 hours of presentation. We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16\%) died and 311 (18.9\%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95\% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In this multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and prednisone administration was found to be associated with improved outcomes. Other treatments were associated with no effect or worse outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective. During the onset of a novel epidemic, there are public health priorities that need to be estimated, such as risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and clinical severity to allocate resources and issue health policies. In this work we calculate the risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19 conferred by demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity factors. Material and methods. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in ≥ 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization. Conclusions. In addition to confirming that older age, diabetes, HBP and obesity are the main risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19, we found that being indigenous, immunosuppression, smoking and asthma protect against infection, and the latter also against hospitalization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              COVID-19 can course with respiratory and extrapulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated host response to this virus. We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.
            
            
              Results
              
                The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78\%) compared to ward patients (27\%) and outpatients (2\%) (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95\%],
                p
                ): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183–12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244–3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382–3.595], 0.001). Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19. Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

	abstract = {Background
            COVID-19 is a newly recognized illness with a predominantly respiratory presentation. As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, it is important to characterize the differences in disease presentation and trajectory between COVID-19 patients and other patients with common respiratory illnesses. These differences can enhance knowledge of pathogenesis and help in guiding treatment.
          
          
            Methods
            Data from electronic medical records were obtained from individuals admitted with respiratory illnesses to Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between October 1st, 2014 and September 1st, 2020. Four groups of patients were defined: COVID-19 (693), influenza (1,612), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (2,292) and Others (4,054). The variable analyzed include demographics (7), vital signs (8), lab tests (38), and comorbidities (15) from a total of 8,651 hospitalized adult patients. Statistical analysis was performed on biomarkers measured at admission and for their disease trajectory in the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and on comorobidity prevalence.
          
          
            Results
            COVID-19 patients were overall younger in age and had higher body mass index, compared to influenza and SARI. Comorbidity burden was lower in the COVID-19 group compared to influenza and SARI. Severely- and moderately-ill COVID-19 patients older than 65 years of age suffered higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to hospitalized influenza patients. At admission, white blood cells and neutrophils were lower among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza and SARI patients, while pulse rate and lymphoctye percentage were higher. Trajectories of variables during the first two days of hospitalization revealed that white blood count, neutrophils percentage and glucose in blood increased among COVID-19 patients, while decreasing among other patients.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The intrinsic virulence of COVID-19 appeared higher than influenza. In addition, several critical functions, such as immune response, coagulation, heart and respiratory function and metabolism were uniquely affected by COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}IMPORTANCE: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are potential sources for transmission; characterization of these cases has not been conducted in most low/middle income countries, including Mexico. OBJECTIVE: To profile pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mexico City, its associated comorbidities and outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study SETTING: Subjects assessed by convenience sampling within the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with and without respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms (RS, NRS, respectively) assessed for SARS-CoV-2 using real time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. OUTCOMES: Severe COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, 30-day mortality and their outcomes in cases RS or NRS and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Amongst 60121 cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 1st, 2020, we identified 5982 cases without RS (9.9\%) and 2452 who were asymptomatic at first evaluation (4.1\%). Compared to cases with RS, NRS and asymptomatic cases were younger and had lower rates of comorbidities. Cases with NRS had higher rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, ICU admission, and intubation (p\&lt;0.001). Mortality was higher for cases with NRS (HR 3.13, 95\%CI 1.80-5.45) or RS (HR 7.58, 95\%CI 4.56-12.58) compared to asymptomatic cases, adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Predictors for mortality in cases without RS included older age, previous exposure to suspected viral infection cases, comorbidities, presence of NRS and vomiting. For asymptomatic SARS-Co-V-2 infections, chronic kidney disease, previous exposure with suspected infection cases and older age were predictors for lethality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Definition of pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic cases has relevant implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Older age and comorbidity impact on the probability of developing severe complications for cases who were asymptomatic or had only NRS at evaluation and were sent for domiciliary treatment. Extending testing for detection of asymptomatic cases must be considered in Mexico to better understand the impact of the pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract BACKGROUND The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Saudi Arabia was first identified in a traveler from Al Qatif city, on March 2nd, 2020. The disease has quickly spread and reached multiple cities within a few weeks. In an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the government has implemented strict regulations. Starting March 15th, all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals in a quarantine facility in the eastern province. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects who were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The study period was from March 16th until April 18th, 2020. We collected data on demographics and on clinical symptoms. Also, samples for PCR tests were collected upon admission and were repeated every 72 hours if they were still positive. All negative samples were repeated within 24 hours for confirmation. RESULTS Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54\%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46\%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5\%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95\% CI,12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95\% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P=0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8\% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3\%. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is high in our study. Testing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell was the most common presentation in our mild symptomatic residents, and it might be predictive of mild disease. The persistent positive PCRs observed in the mild asymptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend \&lt;=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusion: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCWs) have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information about the prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. RESULTS: As of July 2nd, 2020, 34,263 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 10,925 were confirmed (31.9\%). Overall, 4,200 were nurses (38.4\%), 3,244 physicians (29.7\%), 126 dentists (1.15\%) and 3,355 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.7\%). After follow-up, 992 HCWs required hospitalization (9.08\%), 206 developed severe outcomes (1.89\%), and 90 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82\%). Lethality was recorded in 224 (2.05\%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 333 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.05\%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcomes compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding global pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients may present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to conduct detailed analysis on patients with AMI and COVID-19. Methods We included all patients admitted with AMI and actively known or found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR between the 4th February 2020 and the 11th June 2020 in the State of Qatar. Patients were divided into ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-STE (NSTEMI). Results There were 68 patients (67 men and 1 woman) admitted between the 4th of February 2020 and the 11th of June 2020 with AMI and COVID-19. The mean age was 49.1, 46 patients had STEMI and 22 had NSTEMI. 38\% had diabetes mellitus, 31\% had hypertension, 16\% were smokers, 13\% had dyslipidemia, and 14.7\% had prior cardiovascular disease. Chest pain and dyspnea were the presenting symptoms in 90\% and 12\% of patients respectively. Fever (15\%) and cough (15\%) were the most common COVID-19 symptoms, while the majority had no viral symptoms. Thirty-nine (33 STEMI and 6 NSTEMI) patients underwent coronary angiography, 38 of them had significant coronary disease. Overall in-hospital MACE was low; 1 patient developed stroke and 2 died. Conclusion Contrary to previous small reports, overall in-hospital adverse events were low in this largest cohort of COVID-19 patients presenting with AMI. We hypothesize patient profile including younger age contributed to these findings. Further studies are required to confirm this observation.

            Objectives
            To determine clinical course and outcomes in rheumatic disease patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare results to uninfected patients.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from 02/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64\% African American) were identified. The 34 (49\%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently (p{\textless}0.01). All 10 patients on anti-TNFα medications were treated as outpatients (p{\textless}0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50\%) vs 27 (26\%), OR=2.78 (95\% CI: 1.24 to 6.20)) and intubation (10 (29\%) vs 6 (6\%), OR=6.67 (95\% CI: 2.20 to 20.16)) than uninfected patients. They also had higher mortality rates (6 (18\%) vs 3 (3\%), OR=7.21 (95\% CI: 1.70 to 30.69)). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, one was of African ancestry (p=0.03).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Rheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNFα medications were hospitalized less frequently while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently. These findings have important implications for medication choice in rheumatic disease patients during the ongoing spread of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background: Concerns have emerged about the higher risk of fatal COVID-19 in cancer patients. In this paper, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days. Results: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between mid-March and early May 2020, 141 (1.4\%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40\%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies (both 13\%). Patients with active cancer therapy or/and advanced cancer accounted for 88\% and 69\% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 79\% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement ≤50\% in 90\% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48\% and 7\% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18\%) have died from COVID-19, and 81 (57\%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation. Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population. The outcome of COVID-19 is primarily driven by the initial severity of infection rather than patient or cancer characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective We compared the clinical characteristics, findings and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences. Methods From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at the HUS Jorvi Hospital, Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for at least 30 days from admission. Results We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61\% vs 67\%) and had at least one comorbidity (68\% vs 85\%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18\%] vs 15 [45\%], P=0.03 and 1 [4\%] vs 10 [30\%], P=0.008). In chest x-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68\%] and 7 [21\%], P {\textless} 0.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93\%] vs 19 [58\%], P=0.003 and 8 [29\%] vs 2 [6\%], P=0.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (6 days [IQR 4-21] vs 3 [2-4], P{\textless}0.001). Conclusion Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives To determine the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the incidence of seroconversion in the first month of follow-up among interns, residents, and medical doctors attending patients at a University Hospital, to explore for associations of seroprevalence and seroconversion with risk factors and symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and to explore the concordance of CLA, LFA, and ELFA. Design or methods We conducted a cross-sectional and a prospective study among medical doctors and medical trainees at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota (Colombia) during June, July, and August to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in this population was performed using CLA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLA IgG. Results At baseline, 8 (2.28\% 95\%CI 1.16-4.43\%) individuals were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98\% 95\%CI 3.94-8.97\%) individuals seroconverted by CLA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLA and of these 11 (3.13\% 95\%CI 1.76-5.52\%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLA had moderate concordance with LFA IgG and ELFA, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusions Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93\%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection/disease spread.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The United States (US) has not been spared in the ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease. COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Prisons in the United States have become a hotbed for spreading Covid-19 among incarcerated individuals. Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19. Methods: An observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Results: Of the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 +/- 16.1 years, 57\% males, and 44\% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9\% vs. 18.7\%), required vasopressors (24.1\% vs. 9.9\%), and intubated (25.0\% vs. 15.2\%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6\% vs. 20.1\%) and 30-day mortality (34.3\% vs. 24.6\%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.24 to 2.98). Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A biased set of survivors (n=15) who were demonstrated an unexpected and rapid recovery after a prolonged period of mechanical ventilatory support. Results Respiratory failure trajectories of survivors and non-survivors were similar once aligned indicating, from a respiratory function perspective, it is difficult to identify survivors from non-survivors with some survivors improving late in their disease (day 20 - 30 from symptom onset) Non-survivors are admitted earlier in their disease (p \&lt; 0.05) and had worse organ failure requirements prior to the nadir of their respiratory funciton (p \&lt; 0.05) compard to survivors. Conclusion Analysis of multiple factors fails to differentiate between survivors and non-survivors. Even when faced with multiorgan failure, perseverance until discharge must be advocated as late improvements do occur in survivors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.},

	abstract = {Background
Influenza is a common cause of severe respiratory illness, but risk factors for hospitalisation in low income settings with a high HIV prevalence are not well described. We aimed to assess risk factors associated with influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalisation in South Africa.
Methods
We conducted a case-population study using data on risk conditions in patients hospitalised with SARI and the national prevalence of these conditions. Data on hospitalised cases were from the national SARI surveillance program while data on the referent population were from the latest national census or health and demographic surveillance surveys.
Findings
From 2009 to 2012, we identified 3646 (7.9\%) of 46,031 enrolled cases of SARI that were associated with influenza infection. Risk factors associated with hospitalisation included previous history of smoking [case-population ratio (CPR) 3.82, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.5–4.16], HIV infection (CPR 3.61, 95\% CI 3.5–3.71), asthma (CPR 2.45, 95\% CI 2.19–2.73), previous history of hospital admission in the past 12months (CPR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.92–2.23), and tuberculosis (CPR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.68–2.02). When stratified by age, there is increased risk of hospitalisation in those ⩽5yearsof age (CPR 3.07, 95\% CI 2.93–3.21) and among those 35yearsof age and above (CPR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.28–1.18). Male sex (CPR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.82–0.88) and completion of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination schedule in children {\textless}5yearsof age (CPR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.71–0.77) were associated with decreased risk of hospitalisation.
Conclusion
These results identify groups at high-risk for severe influenza who should be considered potential targets for influenza vaccination in South Africa and similar settings.},

	abstract = {Objective To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island.
Participants 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.
Main outcome measures Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality.
Results Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2\%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9\%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5\%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3\%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6\%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4\%) died and 170 (26.2\%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of {\textgreater}2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95\% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI {\textgreater}40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI {\textgreater}40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of {\textless}88\% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level {\textgreater}1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level {\textgreater}200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level {\textgreater}2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone.
Conclusions Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) mortality in hospitalised patients is strongly associated with old age, nursing home residence, male sex and obesity, with a more controversial association with ethnicity and chronic diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus. Further complicating the evaluation of the independent impacts of these risk factors is the failure to control for frailty in the published studies thus far. Aim: To determine the true risk factors for mortality in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 in Croydon needing hospital admission and to evaluate the independence of these risk factors in this group after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and frailty. Methods: This observational study retrospectively reviewed hospital electronic medical records of 466 consecutive patients who were admitted to Croydon University Hospital confirmed positive by rapid PCR test from 11th March 2020 to 9th April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple unconditional and univariate logistic regression. Results: After multivariate analysis, male sex [OR 1.44 (CI 0.92-2.40)], age (per year) [OR 1.07 (CI 1.05-1.09)], morbid obesity (BMI \&gt; 40 kg/m2 vs reference BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ) [OR 14.8 (CI 5.25-41.8)], and nursing home residence (OR 3.01 (CI 1.56-5.79) were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality with no statistically significant association found with chronic diseases or ethnicity. In the non-nursing home population, after adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor was 1.64 (CI 1.03-2.61, p = 0.03) and was and was attenuated to 1.30 (CI 0.78-2.18)) after controlling for BMI; the association of mortality with male sex was strengthened [OR 1.66 (CI 0.96-2.87)] and that for ethnic minority patients was weakened [South Asians [from OR 1.30 (CI 0.67-2.53)) to OR 1.21 (CI 0.60-2.46)]; African Caribbeans [from OR 1.24 (CI 0.65-2.34) to OR 1.16 (CI 0.58-2.30)]. There was a borderline but potentially large protective effect (p= 0.09) in patients who were on anticoagulation drugs prior to admission [OR 0.56 (CI 0.28-1.11)]. Conclusion: Our study found no significant effect of ethnicity and chronic diseases as independent risk factors on COVID-19 mortality in Croydon population whereas male sex, high BMI, old age and frailty were found to be independent risk factors. Routine prophylactic treatment with anticoagulant drugs in the high-risk COVID-19 population warrants further prompt investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 4 October 2020. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support. Report highlights include: ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 102,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40\% of patients \&gt;80 years experienced confusion. The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 102,959 individuals from 566 sites across 42 countries. The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals: 1. for whom data collection commenced on or before 14 September 2020. AND 2. who have laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-COV-2 infection. For the 88,463 cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report: o The median age is 72 years. o A total of 18\% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit. o Antibiotic use is high (82.2\% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.) o Fever, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms. o Altered consciousness/confusion was also relatively frequent (19,619/86,175) and most common in elderly patients. Overall, elderly patients are less likely to present with URTI symptoms.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Clinical spectrum of COVID-19 has been unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to present clinical course of all laboratory-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predicting factors of pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, regardless of their disease severity, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. We described the full picture of COVID-19, defined definite outcomes and evaluated factors associated with pneumonia. Results: One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5\% were male. Of whom, 189 (97.9\%) recovered and 4 (2.1\%) died. More than half (56\%) of the patients were mild, 22\% were moderate, 14\% were severe, and 3\% were critically ill. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5\%. The overall incidence of pneumonia was 39\%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65\% vs. 35\%). Increasing age (OR 2.60 for every 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95\% CI, 1.68 to 3.97; p\&lt;0.001), obesity (OR 9.17; 95\% CI, 2.11 to 39.89; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.66 per one-degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95\% CI, 2.32 to 9.34; p\&lt;0.001) were potential predicting factors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe cases had a longer viral RNA shedding duration than the non-severe cases. The longest observed duration of viral RNA shedding was 45 days. Conclusion: Across different disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in Thailand had a good prognosis. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of the hospitalized patients. Potential predicting factors included old age, obesity, fever at presentation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background：In January 19, 2020, first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (COVID-19) was confirmed in Chongqing municipality, China. Methods：In this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27\%) and 50 (18.73\%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3\%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8\%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7\%] vs 39 [78.0\%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0\%] vs 26 [12.0\%]). 41 (15.4\%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1\%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3\%), fatigue (208 [77.9\%]), dry cough (189 [70.8\%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9\%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0\%] vs 26 [12.0\%]) and confusion (10 [20.0\%] vs 15 [6.9\%]). Rales (32 [12.0\%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5\%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1\%], 10 [4.6\%]). 118 (44.2\%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5\%), 61 (22.8\%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 \% of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100\%). 53.1\% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4\%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0\%] vs 29[56.9\%], 31 [68.9\%] vs 20 [39.2\%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1\%], 35 [52.2\%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2\%] vs 15 [51.7\%], 25 [65.8\%] vs 10 [34.5\%], 17 [44.7\%] vs 5 [17.2\%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100\%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0\%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0\%], 35[70.0\%], 12[24.0\%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0\%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5\%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4\%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objectives To recognise clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia and its differences from influenza pneumonia. Methods 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. Results The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25\% female and 46.75\% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05\% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54\% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11\%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04\%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11\%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic ‘bat wing sign’. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. Conclusion There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.},

	abstract = {Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, and therefore the prevention and treatment of this disease is an important priority of world health. In the present study, some risk factors, including unhealthy nutrition, obesity, and physical inactivity, were assessed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and their effects on the severity and duration of disease were evaluated., Subject and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study. Data was collected from all patients who visited the respiratory emergency department from March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020 in the University Hospital. The outcome measures were body mass index, diet quality that was evaluated with a 16-item food intake questionnaire, and physical activity level that was assessed by the global physical activity questionnaire., Results: Two hundred and six patients' data was analyzed. The results investigated that patients with lower levels of physical activity or lower MET.min/week were affected by a more severe form of the disease (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). We found that patients with a healthier dietary pattern were affected by lower severity of illness (p {\textless} 0.05)., Conclusion: It seems that increasing levels of physical activity may partly reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. Some dietary patterns such as increasing fruit and poultry consumption as well as drinking less tea were correlated significantly with a less severe form of the disease. The results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potentially harmful effect of smoking on the severity or duration of symptoms.

The aim of the study was to document the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19 positive patients and analyze the effect of various factors on the occurrence of these chemosensory dysfunction in the local population. Tertiary referral center. Prospective Study. 250 subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and admitted in Isolation ward were enrolled for the study. Data was collected from the subjects via oral questionnaire method, based on the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool. Data was collected regarding the age, gender, olfactory or gustatory disturbances, history of recent travel or contact with a positive case, smoking, any associated symptoms, any co-morbid conditions and recovery time of sense of olfaction. Out of 250, 179 (71.6\%) subjects were diagnosed with Olfactory dysfunction out of which majority were males, 105 (58.6\%). Most of the patients were above 40 years of age (n = 184, 73.6\%). Majority of the individuals (88 patients) had close contact with a positive case in recent past, followed by 67 patients who were health care workers, hence proving that risk of infection increases with exposure. Anosmia was present in 68.5\% of all the 127 non-smokers. 66.4\% had both olfactory as well as gustatory dysfunction whereas 18 patients (7.2\%) were found to be totally asymptomatic. Mostly patients recovered their sense of smell within 1-2 weeks from the day of onset of anosmia. Presence of olfactory dysfunction of any degree with or without alteration in taste sensation should raise a suspicion of COVID-19 infection, especially when other classical signs are not present. In such conditions, swabs should be sent for confirmation by RT-PCR testing and till results are awaited, the individual should be shifted to quarantine facilities or advised strict self-isolation.

	abstract = {Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which emerged from China and spread all over the world, has affected the world in every aspect and will do so in the foreseeable future. This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement., Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization., Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 +/- 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5\%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9\%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1\%), 72 (63.1\%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant., Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sex is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the epidemiology and outcome of many diseases. This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6\%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9\%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5\%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5\%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0\% vs. 14.6\% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females., CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.},

The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists. The older patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis. The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID-19. Family gatherings were showed among 26.7\% of patients. A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases. CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes. The lungs of severe patients are more damaged. Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis. Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 93.0\%, and the mortality rate was 2.3\%. Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes. The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID-19.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The present study investigated the correlation between the nutritional status and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different nutritional status., METHODS: 429 patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from December 2019 to March 2020 were selected and divided into different groups based on Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score (0-4: the low CONUT score group; 5-12: the high CONUT score group). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the effects of CONUT score on prognosis., RESULTS: The total score of admission status of patients with higher CONUT score was higher than that of those with lower CONUT score (chi2 = 7.152, P = 0.007). The number of adverse outcomes of female was higher than that of male (chi2 = 10.253, P = 0.001). The number of adverse outcomes was higher for patients with smoking history (P = 0.004) or hypertension (chi2 = 11.240, P = 0.001) than those without. Also, the number of adverse outcomes was higher for older patients than younger ones (chi2 = 15.681, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with adverse outcomes had lower urine red blood cell count than patients without adverse outcomes (chi2 = 5.029, P = 0.025). However, BMI, drinking history and diabetes did not show correlation with the prognosis of COVID-19 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Among patients {\textgreater}= 61 years old, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 6.191 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 6.191, 95\% CI: 1.431-26.785). Among the non-diabetic patients, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT group was 11.678 times that of the low CONUT group (OR = 11.678, 95\% CI: 2.754-49.41). For the patients who had a total score of admission status {\textless} 6, the risk of adverse outcomes in the high CONUT score group was 8.216 times that of the low CONUT score group (OR = 8.216, 95\% CI: 2.439-27.682)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with good nutritional status showed a small chance to have adverse outcomes.

Design Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. Setting Community or hospital. No restrictions on location. Participants Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. Measurements Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’). Findings Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 ‘good’ and ‘fair’ quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5\%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR=0.74, 95\% Credible Interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, τ = 0.41). Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.05, 95\% CrI = 0.95-1.17, τ = 0.17) but favoured there being no important association (21\% probability of RR ≥1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalisation (RR=1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, τ = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR=1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, τ = 0.29), and mortality (RR=1.39, 95\% CrI = 1.09-1.87, τ = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, τ = 0.27; RR=1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, τ = 0.34; RR=1.22, 95\% CrI = 0.78-1.94, τ = 0.49 respectively) but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalisation and mortality (35\% and 70\% probability of RR ≥1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79\% probability of RR ≥1.1). Conclusions Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalisation, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is the major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet optimal respiratory support strategies are uncertain. 
Objectives
To describe outcomes with high-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with failure.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with HFNC and/or NIPPV to describe rates of success (live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI)), and identify characteristics associated with failure (ETI and/or in-hospital mortality) using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models.
Results
A total of 331 and 747 patients received HFNC and NIPPV as the highest level of non-invasive respiratory support, respectively; 154 (46.5\%) in the HFNC cohort and 167 (22.4\%) in the NIPPV cohort were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was seen among patients with cardiovascular disease (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40; 95\% CI 1.06-1.84), respectively, and among those with lower oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at HFNC and NIPPV initiation (sHR, 0.32; 95\% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34; 95\% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively).
Conclusions
A significant proportion of patients receiving non-invasive respiratory modalities for COVID-19 AHRF achieved successful discharge without requiring ETI, with lower success rates among those with cardiovascular disease or more severe hypoxia. The role of non-invasive respiratory modalities in COVID-19 related AHRF requires further consideration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Fluoride ions are highly reactive, and their incorporation in forming dental enamel at low concentrations promotes mineralization. In contrast, excessive fluoride intake causes dental fluorosis, visually recognizable enamel defects that can increase the risk of caries. To investigate the molecular bases of dental fluorosis, we analyzed the effects of fluoride exposure in enamel cells to assess its impact on Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ signaling. Primary enamel cells and an enamel cell line (LS8) exposed to fluoride showed decreased internal Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ stores and store-operated Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ entry (SOCE). RNA-sequencing analysis revealed changes in gene expression suggestive of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in fluoride-treated LS8 cells. Fluoride exposure did not alter Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ homeostasis or increase the expression of ER stress–associated genes in HEK-293 cells. In enamel cells, fluoride exposure affected the functioning of the ER-localized Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ channel IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R and the activity of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump during Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ refilling of the ER. Fluoride negatively affected mitochondrial respiration, elicited mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and disrupted mitochondrial morphology. Together, these data provide a potential mechanism underlying dental fluorosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Background
              Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.
            
            
              Aims
              We investigated, in the UK Biobank, whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              502,640 participants aged 40–69 years at baseline (54–79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK during 2006–10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried’s classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available for 16/03/2020–01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups.
            
            
              Results
              4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95\%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥ 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0–1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. However, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants.
            
            
              Discussion and conclusions
              Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76\%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67\%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on cross-sectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38\% (95\% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59\%) and individuals with comorbidities (38\%-168\%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.},

              To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units.
            
            
              Design
              Retrospective manual medical record review.
            
            
              Setting
              NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City.
            
            
              Participants
              The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records.
            
            
              Main outcome measures
              Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.
            
            
              Results
              Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9\%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0\% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2\% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4\% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objective
            Anosmia has been listed as a key-symptom associated with the COVID-19 infection. Because it often occurs without any sign of rhinitis, lesions of the central olfactory system have been suspected. To date, however, there is no evidence that anosmia caused by SARS-CoV2 could be the result of brain damage.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a case-series on 10 consecutive COVID-19 patients who reported anosmia. Each patient prospectively underwent a validated olfactory test (Sniffin’ Sticks test) and a brain MRI. Results Hypersignal intensity lesions of the central olfactory system were found in 3 subjects on 3D T2 FLAIR and 2D T2 High Resolution images with a lesion involving the olfactory bulbs and/or the orbitofrontal cortex. These 3 subjects showed a severe and persistent loss of smell on the olfactory test. Mucosal hyperplasia of the upper nasal cavities was found in two other subjects with significant smell disorders. There was no MRI anomaly in two subjects with good smell restoration.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Anomalies of the central olfactory system could be responsible for anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to assess the impact on long-term functional prognosis of these lesions.
          
          
            Key Result
            Central anomalies of the olfactory bulb and cortex could be responsible for anosmia in COVID-19 infection},

	abstract = {Background
              This study aimed to examine associations between smoking and COVID-19 relevant outcomes, taking into account the influence of inequalities and adjusting for potential confounding variables.
            
            
              Methods
              Cross-sectional data were used from an online study of adults in the UK (n=53 002). Main outcome measures were confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and adherence to protective behaviours. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no), key worker status and comorbid health conditions.
            
            
              Results
              Compared with never smokers (0.26\% (95\% CI 0.21\% to 0.33\%)), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.56\% (0.41\% to 0.75\%)) but not ex-smokers (0.19\% (0.13\% to 0.28\%)). Associations were similar before (current: OR=2.14 (1.49–3.08); ex-smokers: OR=0.73 (0.47–1.14)) and after (current: OR=1.79 (1.22–2.62); ex-smokers: OR=0.85 (0.54–1.33)) adjustment. For current smokers, this was moderated by socio-economic position, with higher rates only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR=3.53 (2.04–6.10)). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2\% (10.6\% to 11.9\%), OR=1.11 (1.03–1.20)) and ex-smokers (10.9\% (10.4\% to 11.5\%), OR=1.07 (1.01–1.15)) than never smokers (10.2\% (9.9\% to 10.6\%)), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR=1.21 (1.13–1.29)). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR=1.34 (1.27–1.43); ex-smokers: OR=1.22 (1.16–1.28)). Adherence to recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19 was high (96.3\% (96.1\% to 96.4\%)), but lower among current than never smokers (OR=0.70 (0.62–0.78)).
            
            
              Conclusions
              In a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with self-reported confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socio-economic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Summary
          
            Background
            Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe acute respiratory failure. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is known as the mechanism for severe forms of other coronavirus diseases. The clinical progression of COVID-19 before and after IgG antibody seroconversion was investigated.
          
          
            Methods
            Fifty-three patients with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCT)-confirmed COVID-19 viral pneumonia with or without respiratory failure were retrospectively investigated. The timing of the first IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2-positive date, as well as changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and blood lymphocyte numbers, was assessed using serial preserved blood samples.
          
          
            Findings
            Ten patients recovered without oxygen therapy (mild/moderate group), 32 patients had hypoxemia and recovered with antiviral drugs (severe/non-ICU group), and 11 patients had severe respiratory failure and were treated in the ICU (6 of them died; critical/ICU group). The first IgG-positive date (day 0) was observed from 5 to 18 days from the onset of disease. At day 0, a CRP peak was observed in the severe and critical groups, whereas there was no synchronized CRP peak on day 0 in the mild/moderate group. In the severe/non-ICU group, the blood lymphocyte number increased (P=0.0007) and CRP decreased (P=0.0007) after day 0, whereas CRP did not decrease and the blood lymphocyte number further decreased (P=0.0370) in the critical/ICU group.
          
          
            Interpretation
            The respiratory failure due to COVID-19 viral pneumonia observed in week 2 may be related to an antibody-related mechanism rather than uncontrolled viral replication. In the critical form of COVID-19, inflammation was sustained after IgG seroconversion.

            OBJECTIVE
            To develop and validate a prediction model, based on clinical history and examination findings on initial diagnosis of COVID-19, to identify patients at risk of critical outcomes.
          
          
            DESIGN
            National multicenter cohort study.
          
          
            SETTING
            Data from the SEMI (Sociedad Española de Medicina Interna) COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting in 132 centers between March 23 and May 21, 2020. Model development used data from hospitals with ≥300 beds, and validation used those from hospitals with {\textless}300 beds.
          
          
            PARTICIPANTS
            Adults (age ≥18 years) presenting with COVID-19 diagnosis.
          
          
            MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
            Composite of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit.
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              There were 10,433 patients, 7,850 (main outcome rate 25.1\%) in the model development cohort and 2,583 (main outcome rate 27.0\%) in the validation cohort. The clinical variables in the final model were: age, cardiovascular disease, moderate or severe chronic kidney disease, dyspnea, tachypnea, confusion, systolic blood pressure, and SpO
              2
              ≤93\% or supplementary oxygen requirement at presentation. The model developed had C-statistic of 0.823 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.813 to 0.834) and calibration slope of 0.995. The external validation had C-statistic of 0.792 (95\% CI, 0.772 to 0.812) and calibration slope of 0.872. The model showed positive net benefit in terms of hospitalizations avoided for the predicted probability thresholds between 3\% and 79\%.
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Among patients presenting with COVID-19, easily-obtained basic clinical information had good discrimination for identifying patients at risk of critical outcomes, and the model showed good generalizability. A model-based online prediction calculator provided with this paper would facilitate triage of patients during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Being a newly emerging disease little is known about its long-lasting post COVID-19 consequences. Aim of this work is to assess the frequency, patterns and determinants of persistent post COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the value of a proposed Novel COVID-19 symptoms score. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the registry were included in a cross sectional study. The patient demographics, comorbid disorders, the mean duration since the onset of the symptoms, history of hospital or ICU admittance, and treatment taken during acute state, as well as symptoms score before and after convalescence were recorded.
          
          
            Results
            The most frequent constitutional and neurological symptoms were myalgia (60.0\%), arthralgia (57.2\%), restriction of daily activities (57.0\%), sleeping troubles (50.9\%), followed by anorexia (42.6\%), chest pain (32.6\%), gastritis (32.3\%), cough (29.3\%) and dyspnea (29.1\%). The mean total score of acute stage symptoms was 31.0 ± 16.3 while post COVID 19 symptoms score was 13.1±12.6 (P{\textless}0.001). The main determinants of the persistent post COVID-19 symptoms were the need for oxygen therapy (P{\textless}0.001), pre-existing hypertension (P=0.039), chronic pulmonary disorders (P=0.012), and any chronic comorbidity (P=0.004). There was a correlation between the symptom score during the acute attack and post COVID-19 stage (P{\textless}0.001, r=0.67). The acute phase score had 83.5\% sensitivity and 73.3\% specificity for the cutoff point {\textgreater} 18 to predict occurrence of Post-COVID-19 symptoms.
          
          
            Conclusions
            COVID-19 can present with a diverse spectrum of long-term post COVID-19 symptoms. Increased acute phase symptom severity and COVID-19 symptom score {\textgreater} 18 together with the presence of any comorbid diseases increase the risk for persistent post COVID-19 manifestations and severity.},

          We collected a multi-centric retrospective dataset of patients (N = 213) who were admitted to ten hospitals in Czech Republic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The dataset contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required, pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution. Patients in the dataset were treated with hydroxychloroquine (N = 108), azithromycin (N = 72), favipiravir (N = 9), convalescent plasma (N = 7), dexamethasone (N = 4) and remdesivir (N = 3), often in combination. Most patients were admitted during the first wave of the epidemic. To explore association between treatments and patient outcomes we performed multiverse analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees of freedom. Weak evidence to constrain the potential efficacy of azithromycin and favipiravir can be extracted from the data. Additionally, we performed external validation of several proposed prognostic models for Covid-19 severity showing that they mostly perform unsatisfactorily on our dataset.},

	abstract = {Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are recognized as the major etiologic agents of the common cold. Starting from the observation that local hyperthermic treatment is beneficial in patients with natural and experimental common colds, we have studied the effect of brief hyperthermic treatment (HT) on HRV replication in HeLa cells. We report that a 20-min HT at 45°C is effective in suppressing HRV multiplication by more than 90\% when applied at specific stages of the virus replication cycle. Synthesis of virus proteins is not affected by HT, indicating that the target for treatment is a posttranslational event. The antiviral effect is a transient cell-mediated event and is associated with the synthesis of the 70-kDa heat shock protein hsp70. Unlike poliovirus, rhinovirus infection does not inhibit the expression of hsp70 induced by heat. The possibility that hsp70 could play a role in the control of rhinovirus replication is suggested by the fact that a different class of HSP inducers, the cyclopentenone prostaglandins PGA1 and Δ12-PGJ2, were also effective in inhibiting HRV replication in HeLa cells. Inhibition of hsp70 expression by actinomycin D prevented the antiviral activity of prostaglandins in HRV-infected cells. These results indicate that the beneficial effect of respiratory hyperthermia may be mediated by the induction of a cytoprotective heat shock response in rhinovirus-infected cells.},

Design, participants and setting: Prospective case series of 112 patients admitted to seven hospitals in Melbourne with laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza between 1 May and 17 July 2009. Main outcome measures: Details of case characteristics, risk factors for severe disease, treatment and clinical course. Results: Of 112 hospitalised patients, most presented with cough (88\%) and/or fever (82\%), but several (4\%) had neither symptom. A quarter of female patients (15) were pregnant or in the post-partum period. Patients presenting with multifocal changes on chest x-ray had significantly longer hospital lengths of stay, and were more likely to require intensive care unit admission. Thirty patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and three died during their acute illness. The median length of intensive care admission was 10.5 days (interquartile range, 5–16 days). Conclusions: This study highlights risk factors for severe disease, particularly pregnancy. Clinical and public health planning for upcoming influenza seasons should take into account the spectrum and severity of clinical infection demonstrated in this report, and the need to concentrate resources effectively in high-risk patient groups.},

              Smoking causes inflammation of the lung epithelium by releasing cytokines and impairing mucociliary clearance. Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association.
            
            
              Methods
              This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020.
            
            
              Results
              1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19\% vs 6\%, p{\textless}0.001), HIV infection (11\% vs 5\%,p{\textless}0.001), cancer (11\% vs 6\%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15\% vs 8\%, p{\textless}0.001), coronary artery disease (15\% vs 9\%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11\% vs 8\%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10\% vs 6\%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47\% vs 37\% p=0.005). Univariate Cox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed that among smokers only current smokers had higher risk of death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p{\textless}0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox model for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum lactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were associated with overall improved survival.
            
            
              Conclusion

              Methods
              In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55 years; 68.3\% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7\%), DM (68.3\%), hypertension (42.6\%) and obesity (42.2\%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5\%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5\% versus 12.3\%; p = 0.04) and lower survival time (p = 0.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95\% confidence interval, CI 1.7–5.3); p {\textless} 0.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4–8.3); p = 0.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0–17.2); p {\textless} 0.001], β-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0–2.9); p = 0.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1–3.3); p = 0.02], creatinine {\textgreater} 90 µmol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3–3.5); p = 0.004] and 25(OH)D {\textless} 12.5 nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7–28.2); p = 0.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0–2.2); p = 0.04], as well as smoking, β-blocker use, neutrophil {\textgreater} 7.5, creatinine {\textgreater} 90 µmol/l and alanine aminotransferase {\textgreater} 65U/l.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, β-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome. Patients with acute metabolic dysfunctions, including hyperglycemia on admission are more likely to receive intensive care.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan city has spread rapidly around the world. The risk for poor outcome dramatically increases once a patient progresses to the severe or critical stage. The present study aims to investigate the risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19.
Methods: We conducted a cohort study that included 1007 individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan. Clinical characteristics and baseline laboratory ﬁndings were collected. Patients were followed up for 28 days for observation of disease progression. The end point was the progression to a more severe disease stage.
Results: During a follow up of 28 days, 720 patients (71.50\%) had recovered or were symptomatically stable, 222 patients (22.05\%) had progressed to severe disease, 22 patients (2.18\%) had progressed to the critically ill stage and 43 patients (4.27\%) had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models identiﬁed that increased age (hazard ratio (HR) 2.56, 95\% CI 1.97e3.33), male sex (HR 1.79, 95\% CI 1.41 e2.28), presence of hypertension (HR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.11e1.88), diabetes (HR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.35e2.44), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.38e2.93) and coronary artery disease (HR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.26e2.66) were risk factors for disease progression. History of smoking was protective against disease progression (HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.34e0.91). Elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.02e2.90), urea nitrogen (HR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.21e2.43), a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HR 3.02, 95\% CI 1.26e7.21) and D-dimer (HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.12e3.58) at baseline were also associated with risk for disease progression.
Conclusions: This study identiﬁed a panel of risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19. Y. Cen, Clin Microbiol Infect 2020;▪:1 © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction There is limited data on clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal. Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context. Methodology We identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. Results The study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3\%) were males. 159 (72.3\%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1\%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7\%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2\%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6\%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9\%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1\% vs. 12.6\%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2\% vs. 69.8\%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8\% vs. 12.1\%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3\% vs. 24.5\%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8\% vs. 22.6\%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253 x 10{\textasciicircum}9/L vs. 185 x10{\textasciicircum}9/L, p=0.02). Conclusions Most cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths. Pranayama practice was associated with protection against severe COVID-19, but more data is needed to substantiate this. The association of platelets count with symptom status in the Nepalese population needs further exploration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objectives
            Recent reports suggest a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in COVID-19 patients, but the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the clinical course of COVID-19 is unknown. We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes.
          
          
            Design
            We analyzed data from the prospective Dutch COVID-PREDICT cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection.
          
          
            Setting
            Patients from 8 participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the COVID-PREDICT cohort were included.
          
          
            Participants
            Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during hospitalization. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics.
          
          
            Primary and secondary outcomes measures
            The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of ICU-admission and ICU-mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors.
          
          
            Results
            We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66±15 of whom 60.5\% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics were used by 45\%, 34.7\%, and 22.1\% of patients. After adjustment for age and sex, the presence of ≥2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95\%CI 1.15-2.02), but not with ICU-admission. Moreover, the use of ≥2 antidiabetics and ≥2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of respectively 2.09 (95\%CI 1.55-2.80) and 1.46 (95\%CI 1.11-1.91).
          
          
            Conclusions
            The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex. Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID-19 patients are warranted.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of this study
            
              
                While previous data reported a high prevalence of CVD risk factors in COVID-19 patients, this study investigated whether diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension predict adverse outcomes.
              
              
                This study is limited by the use of medication as surrogate for cardiovascular risk factors
              
              
                The causality of the investigated risk factors remains to be addressed in future studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created high demand for medical resources, including personnel, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators. As thousands of patients are hospitalized, the disease has shown remarkable diversity in its manifestation; many patients with mild to no symptoms recover from the disease requiring minimal care, but some patients with severe disease progression require mechanical ventilation support in intensive care units (ICU) with an increased risk of death. Studying the characteristics of patients in these various strata can help us understand the varied progression of this disease, enable earlier interventions for at-risk patients, and help manage medical resources more efficiently. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of 10,123 COVID-19 patients treated at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, including their demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical history. Specifically, we present a staging scheme based on discrete clinical events (i.e., admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death), and investigate the temporal trend of clinical variables and the effect of comorbidities in each of those stages. We then developed a prognostic model to predict ventilation demands at an individual patient level by analyzing baseline clinical variables, which entails (1) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and a decision tree model to identify predictors for mechanical ventilation; and (2) a logistic regression model based on these risk factors to predict which patients will eventually need ventilatory support. Our results indicate that the prognostic model achieves an AUC of 0.823 (95\% CI: 0.765–0.880) in identifying patients who will eventually require mechanical ventilation.},

Design Retrospective case series.
Setting Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
Participants Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020.
Main outcome measures Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.
Results The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73\%) than in recovered patients (88; 55\%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48\%) and 16 (14\%)) than recovered patients (39 (24\%) and 7 (4\%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62\%), 55 (49\%), and 25 (22\%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31\%), 48 (30\%), and 1 (1\%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50\%) patients who died and 6 (4\%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91\%) and 76 (47\%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100\%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51\%), sepsis (113; 100\%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77\%), heart failure (41/83; 49\%), alkalosis (14/35; 40\%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37\%), acute kidney injury (28; 25\%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20\%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.
Conclusion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.},

Current methods of measuring these parameters in \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} have low temporal resolution and/or require disrupting sleep. Here we report a novel analysis tool for high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of sleep pressure and depth from movement data. Probability of transitioning to an active state, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of transitioning to an inactive state, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. \textit{In vivo} and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are independent and control the amount of total sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these probabilities are tied to specific biological processes. Genetic and environmental perturbations demonstrate that a given amount of sleep can be produced by many combinations of underlying P(Wake) and P(Doze). We show that measuring sleep pressure and depth continuously, without disturbing on-going behavior, provides greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: Case registries of pregnant women diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have reported that the majority experienced mild infection, but up to 9\% may require critical care. Most COVID-19 cases published were in the third trimester of pregnancy, which could reflect reporting bias, higher risk of infection or increased disease severity in late pregnancy. Seroprevalence studies may allow reliable estimates of the susceptibility to infection and clinical spectrum since they include asymptomatic and mild infections not tested for PCR. We evaluated the seroprevalence and clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women in the first and third trimester. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution and informed consent was obtained. We recruited 874 consecutive pregnancies attending for first trimester screening (10-16 weeks of gestation, n=372) or delivery (n=502) from April 14 to May 5. All women were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms two months prior to sampling. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgA antibodies were tested (COVID-19 VIRCLIA Monotest, Vircell Microbiologist, Spain; reported sensitivity 70\% IgG and 89\% IgM/IgA, and specificity 89\% and 99\% respectively). Indeterminate results were re-tested (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV2 Total Tests, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA; 100\% sensitivity and specificity) and re-classified as positive or negative. Women with COVID-19 were diagnosed and managed according to standard protocols and guidelines3,4. Statistical differences were tested using the χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ test or Student t-test as appropriate (p\&lt;0.05). Results: A total of 125 of 874 women (14.3\%) were positive for either IgG or IgM/IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 54/372 (14.5\%) in the first and 71/502 (14.1\%) in the third trimester. A total of 75/125 (60\%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, whereas 44 (35.2\%) reported one or more symptoms, of which 31 (24.8\%) had at least 3 symptoms or anosmia and 8 (6.4\%) dyspnea. Overall, 7 women (5.6\%) were admitted for persistent fever despite paracetamol and dyspnea, of which 3 had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. All 3 had criteria for severity (bilateral chest condensation, respiratory rate\&gt;30 and leukopenia) and required oxygen support but not critical care or mechanical ventilation, and they were all discharged well. The rates of symptomatic infection, hospital admission or dyspnea were significantly higher in third trimester women (Table and Figure). Discussion: The 14.3\% seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women in this study was substantially larger than the contemporary rates of PCR positive cases (0.78\%) reported for women 20-40y in Barcelona. The data confirm that COVID-19 is asymptomatic in the majority of pregnant women6 and illustrate the value of seroprevalence studies to capture the high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections. In this study, none of the 125 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection required critical care as compared to 9\% reported in cases diagnosed with PCR. However, the proportion of infections with symptoms or dyspnea was remarkably higher in the third trimester, and these results are in line with COVID-19 registries, reporting that 81\% of hospitalized women were in late pregnancy or peripartum. These results provide reassuring information that, even in settings with a high prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy mostly presents with asymptomatic or mild clinical forms. The susceptibility to infection seemed to be the same in the first and the third trimesters of gestation. The data further suggest that, as with other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 could be more severe and require increased surveillance in late pregnancy. These findings should be confirmed and extended with larger consecutive prevalence studies in pregnancy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
            : The uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a critical role in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is thought to be intricate to inflammatory signal amplification. This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.
            Methods
            : We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays
            Results
            : Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was ≥ 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3\% and specificity for 95.8\%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p{\textless}0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p{\textless}0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels.
            Conclusion
            : Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality. The use of severity biomarkers such as sTREM-1 together with patients clinical scores could improve the early recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 cases with higher risk of disease worsening.

Recently, studies have revealed the involvement of both genetic and exposure factors in the susceptibility of COVID-19. However, the correlation between them is still unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the correlation between genetic and exposure factors associated with COVID-19. We retrieved the information of 7362 participants with COVID-19 testing results from the UK Biobank. We identified genetic factors for COVID-19 by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary analysis. In this study, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 15 exposure factors [smoking, alcohol intake, daytime dozing, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, dementia, atmosphere NO2 concentration, socioeconomic status, education qualification, ethnicity, and income] were found to be potential risk factors of COVID-19. Then, a gene-exposure (GxE) association network was built based on the correlation among and between these genetic factors and exposure factors. rs140092351, a SNP on microRNA miR1202, not only had the most significant association with COVID-19, but also interacted with multiple exposure factors. Dementia, alcohol consumption, daytime dozing, BMI, HDL, and atmosphere NO2 concentration were among most significant GxE interactions with COVID-19 infection (P=0.001). Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95\% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95\% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score models were built to adjust for potential confounders., FINDINGS: Among 9,991 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 2,212 (22.1\%) patients were self-reported smokers (406 current and 1806 former). Current smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (propensity score [PS]-adjusted OR 0.91; p=0.46), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.77; p=0.12), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.18; p=0.37), or intubation (PS-OR 1.04; p=0.85). Similarly, former smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.88; p=0.11), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.78), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.95), or intubation (PS-OR 0.93; p=0.57). Furthermore, smoking (current or former) was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.85; p=0.05), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.94; p=0.49), ICU admission (PS-OR 0.86; p=0.17), or intubation (PS-OR 0.79; p=0.06)., INTERPRETATION: Smoking is a well-known risk factor associated with greater susceptibility and subsequent increased severity of respiratory infections. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers may have increased risk and severe pneumonia. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers are believed to have an increased risk of mortality as well as severe pneumonia. However, in our analysis of real-world clinical data, smoking was not associated with increased in-patient mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, in accordance with prior reports.

We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment features of the psoriasis patients during the pandemic period. We conducted a study in dermatology clinics of seven different tertiary centers. All adult psoriasis patients who were followed up between 11 March 2020 and 28 June 2020, were phone called or questioned in their visit to their follow-up clinics. A semistructured questionnaire was applied and patients' demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. Of 1322 patients, 52.4\% were male, and 47.6\% were female. According to the questionnaire responses, 964 (72.9\%) of these patients could not communicate with their physician during this period, remained 358 (27.1\%) patients contacted the physician by phone, email, or hospital visit. From the patients diagnosed as probable/confirmed COVID-19, 14 were female, and 9 were male. Nine of 23 (39.1\%) patients were using biologic treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hospitalization from COVID-19 between the patients using biologics (n = 9) and those who did not (n = 14) (P = 1.00). No mortality was observed among them. Obesity, smoking, age, and accompanying psoriatic arthritis were not among the risk factors affecting the frequency of COVID-19. We only encountered an increased risk in diabetic patients. Also, an exacerbation of psoriasis was observed with the infection. No difference was found in patients with psoriasis in terms of COVID-19 infection in patients who use biologics and those who don't. Copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Positive/equivocal findings were confirmed by Abbott and microneutralization tests. Positivity by two of the three assays or RT-PCR indicated a Covid-19 case (CoV+)., RESULTS: The rate of CoV(+) was 3.3\% (36/1095) and seropositivity 3.0\% (33/1095). CoV(+) was associated with contact with a known Covid-19 case, and working on a Covid-19-dedicated ward or one with cases among staff. The rate in the Covid-19-dedicated ICU was negligible. Smoking and age {\textless}55 years were associated with decreased risk. CoV(+) was strongly associated with ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, fatigue, fever, and chest pressure. Seropositivity was recorded for 89.3\% of those with prior documented RT-PCR-positivity and 2.4\% of those RT-PCR-negative. The rate of previously unidentified cases was 0.7\% (8/1067) and asymptomatic ones 0\% (0/36)., CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases among HCWs proved rare. An increased risk was associated with Covid-19-dedicated wards. Particularly high rates were seen for wards with liberal HCW-HCW contacts, highlighting the importance of social distancing also among HCWs. Copyright 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID-19, accounting for other possible confounders, is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. During statistical analysis, possible confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities including, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, any history of cancer and prior liver disease, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke, were accounted for., RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (mean (SD) age, 64.11 (16) years; 965(51.6\%) males; 1494 (79.9\%) African Americans; 809 (43.2\%) with {\textgreater}= 3 comorbidities) were included in the study. During their stay at the hospital, 613 patients (32.8\%) died, 489 (26.1\%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 592 (31.6\%) required ICU admission. In fully adjusted models, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR), 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.72; p = 0.01), higher rate of ICU admission (aOR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.68; p = 0.009) and increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.72; p = 0.01). Additionally, patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission (aOR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.55; p = 0.03) in fully adjusted models., CONCLUSION: Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes, in COVID-19 patients. These results can help facilitate efficient resource allocation for critical care services.},

We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen {\textless}= 2, 3-4, and {\textgreater}= 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization., RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5\% for level 1 to 23\% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95\% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of disease severity and other determinants of COVID-19 drug use is necessary for appropriate conduct and interpretation of non-randomized studies evaluating outcomes of COVID-19 treatments.},

We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of acute stroke in geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors., RESULTS: Combined ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 4.15\%. 72.7\% of events occurred during acute care. Strokes presented with altered state of consciousness and/or delirium in 81.8\%, followed by a focal neurological deficit in 45.5\%. Ischemic stroke was more frequently unilateral (88.8\%) and localized in the middle cerebral artery territory (55.5\%). Smoking and a history of previous stroke increased by more than seven (OR 7.44; 95\% CI 1.75-31.64; p = 0.007) and five times (OR 5.19; 95\% CI 1.50-17.92; p = 0.009), respectively, the risk of stroke.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Preliminary reports indicated that smokers could be less susceptible to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, once infected an increased risk of severe disease is reported. We investigated the association between smoking and COVID-19 during an outbreak of the disease on a naval vessel., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on the 1769 sailors of a same navy aircraft carrier at sea exposed at the same time to SARS-CoV2 to investigate the link between tobacco consumption and Covid-19., RESULTS: Among the 1688 crewmembers (87\% men; median age= 28 (IQR 23-35)) included, 1279 (76\%) developed Covid-19 (1038 (62\%) RT-PCR-positive and 241 (14\%) with only clinical signs). One hundred and seven patients were hospitalized. The univariable analysis odds ratio (OR) for Covid-19 infection was 0.59 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.78; P{\textless}0.001) for current smokers vs. former and nonsmokers; sex, body mass index or blood group had no significant impact. Crewmembers {\textgreater}50 years old had an increased risk of contracting Covid-19 (OR, 2.84 [95\% CI, 1.30-7.5]; P=0.01). Multivariable analysis retained the lower risk of current smokers becoming infected (OR, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]; P{\textless}0.001) and age {\textgreater}50 years was significatively associated with Covid-19 (OR, 2.6 [1.17-6.9]; P=0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as an efficient protection against infection. Mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research., IMPLICATIONS: Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and Covid-19. Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76\% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significant lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71\%) versus former and non smokers (80\%). This finding strongly supports the need for further research on nicotine physiological pathway and its impact on COVID-19 infection whilst emphasizing that tobacco smoking should not be considered as an efficient protection against COVID-19.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined. All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and death, were evaluated. Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained., RESULTS: Of all the patients enrolled, 954 (42.0\%) had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension (28.8\%) and diabetes mellitus (17.0\%). The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age (P {\textless} 0.001). The number of patients requiring intensive care (P {\textless} 0.001) and invasive MV (P {\textless} 0.001) increased with age. The in-hospital death rate increased with age (P {\textless} 0.001). Patients requiring intensive care (5.3\% vs. 1.6\%; P {\textless} 0.001) and invasive MV (4.3\% vs. 1.7\%; P {\textless} 0.001) were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. In-hospital mortality (12.9\% vs. 3.1\%; P {\textless} 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs. Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and in-hospital death. Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and in-hospital death. In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.01; P = 0.027) were independent predictors of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding variables. Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.43; 95\% CI, 1.51-3.90; P {\textless} 0.001) and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.43; 95\% CI, 1.06-5.87; P = 0.049) were independent predictors of in-hospital death., CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, the patients with confirmed COVID-19 with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs had worse clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, 750 000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae., METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged {\textgreater}=18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression., FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40.0 (30.0 to 53.0). 1397 (66.9\%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87.5\%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64.0\%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 12.0) and 1481 (70.9\%) were given propofol for a median of 7.0 days (4.0 to 11.0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81.6\%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10.0 days (6.0 to 15.0) and 1147 (54.9\%) were delirious for a median of 3.0 days (2.0 to 6.0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p{\textless}=0.04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p{\textless}0.0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5.0 days (0.0 to 14.0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p{\textless}0.01). 601 (28.8\%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU., INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19., FUNDING: None., TRANSLATIONS: For the French and Spanish translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.

Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment., KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: \$34,758 (24,531-56,095) vs. \$63,317 (49,850-85,776), p {\textless} 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4\% vs. 11.2\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4\%, highest quartile: 16.0\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2\%, 19.9\%, p {\textless} 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income (\$10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95\% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95\% CI 0.89, 0.96), p {\textless} 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage, which is closely associated with race, is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage should be used to inform policies that aim to reduce COVID-19 disparities in the Black community.},

Contact history, comorbidities and tobacco and alcohol use were elicited using standard tools., RESULTS: Among 911 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 47.5\% were symptomatic, 14.1\% had severe COVID-19 and 41 (4.5\%) died. Older age, working outside the home, cardiac and respiratory comorbidity and alcohol use were found to increase the risk of symptomatic disease as compared with asymptomatic infection. Current tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} 0.26 to 0.78]) but not smokeless tobacco use (OR 0.81 [95\% CI 0.55 to 1.19]) appeared to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease. Age {\textgreater}=60 y and renal comorbidity were significantly associated with severe COVID-19. Age {\textgreater}=60 y and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity were found to predispose to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The apparent reduced risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among tobacco smokers could be due to residual confounding owing to unknown factors, while acknowledging the limitation of recall bias. Cross-protection afforded by frequent upper respiratory tract infection among tobacco smokers could explain why a similar association was not found for smokeless tobacco use, thereby being more plausible than the 'nicotinic hypothesis'. Those with comorbidities and age {\textgreater}=60 y should be prioritized for hospital admission. Copyright The Author(s) 2021.

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted at the same time thus allowing for distributional regression. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13\% (95\% CI: 0.11\%,0.15\%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those \&gt;64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69\% (61\%,76\%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background The novel coronavirus has become a global threat and healthcare concern. The manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20 to May 20, 2020. Results The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8\%), followed by fever (62.5\%) and cough (45.8\%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75\% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79\% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8\%) showed typical findings of patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6\%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. Conclusion It seems that COVID-19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O2 saturation, and Multi lobar view in chest C.T. scan may be of prognostic value. However, many SARS-COV-2 demonstrations are similar to those of the general population.},

              This study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
            
            
              Methods
              We analyzed the electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Third Hospital of Wuhan.
            
            
              Results
              The patients’ median age was 56 years, 54.1\% were female, 11.4\% had a history of smoking, and 10.6\% had a history of drinking. All cases of COVID-19 were community-acquired. Fever (76.8\%) and cough (53.3\%) were the most common clinical manifestations, and circulatory system diseases were the most common comorbidities. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 61.2\% of the patients, and 2.9\% of the patients were asymptomatic. Computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities in most patients (72.6\%) and consolidation in 30.9\%. Lymphopenia (72.3\%) and hypoproteinemia (71.6\%) were observed in most patients. About 20\% of patients had abnormal liver function. Patients with severe disease had significantly more prominent laboratory abnormalities, including an abnormal lymphocyte count and abnormal C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, and albumin levels.
            
            
              Conclusion
              SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of severe respiratory illnesses similar to those caused by SARS-CoV-1. Older age, chronic comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities are associated with disease severity.},

At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan)., RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81\% (95\% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44\% (95\% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70\% (95\% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95\% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital.

Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, health care exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled in a population-based study before the pandemic (n = 67 cancer patients; n = 256 noncancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.16, 95\% confidence interval = 1.12 to 4.18) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio = 5.67, 95\% confidence interval = 1.49 to 21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.

Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclinicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population., RESULTS: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84\%) had solid tumors and 31 (16\%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77\%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64\%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7\% (95\% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age {\textgreater}= 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P {\textless} .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1\% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60\% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease., CONCLUSION: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population. Fragile patients and smokers are entitled to active preventive measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close monitoring in the case of exposure or COVID-19-related symptoms.},

Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5\%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24\%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p {\textless} 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9\% vs. 20.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95\% CI 1.29-2.03; p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p {\textless} 0.001), and mortality (39.7\% vs. 15.5\%; p {\textless} 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19. Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during in-hospital stay.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases., METHODS: Physician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. Age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis, disease activity and medications were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. Analyses were further stratified according to rheumatic disease category., RESULTS: Of 3729 patients (mean age 57 years, 68\% female), 390 (10.5\%) died. Independent factors associated with COVID-19-related death were age (66-75 years: OR 3.00, 95\% CI 2.13 to 4.22; {\textgreater}75 years: 6.18, 4.47 to 8.53; both vs {\textless}=65 years), male sex (1.46, 1.11 to 1.91), hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease (1.89, 1.31 to 2.73), chronic lung disease (1.68, 1.26 to 2.25) and prednisolone-equivalent dosage {\textgreater}10 mg/day (1.69, 1.18 to 2.41; vs no glucocorticoid intake). Moderate/high disease activity (vs remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death (1.87, 1.27 to 2.77). Rituximab (4.04, 2.32 to 7.03), sulfasalazine (3.60, 1.66 to 7.78), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate or tacrolimus: 2.22, 1.43 to 3.46) and not receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (2.11, 1.48 to 3.01) were associated with higher odds of death, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Other synthetic/biological DMARDs were not associated with COVID-19-related death., CONCLUSION: Among people with rheumatic disease, COVID-19-related death was associated with known general factors (older age, male sex and specific comorbidities) and disease-specific factors (disease activity and specific medications). The association with moderate/high disease activity highlights the importance of adequate disease control with DMARDs, preferably without increasing glucocorticoid dosages.

Existing findings on the effects of smoking on COVID-19 are also controversial and need to be confirmed by further research. In addition, the effects of alcohol consumption and betel quid (BQ) chewing on COVID-19 are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the effects of smoking, drinking, BQ chewing, and underlying diseases on the severity of COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted on 91 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Yueyang, Hunan Province, China from 21 January to 8 March, 2020. Patient demographic data, and information on smoking, drinking and BQ chewing, and underlying diseases were extracted from the patient electronic medical records (EMR) and telephone interviews. The chi-square test was used to conduct a univariate analysis of the factors influencing the severity of COVID-19, and ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors related to the severity of COVID-19. The results showed that the rates of smoking, drinking and BQ chewing were 15.4, 26.4, and 7.1\%, respectively, there was no significant relationship between these lifestyle factors and the severity of COVID-19 (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, underlying diseases such as diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 7.740, 95\% confidence interval (CI):1.000-60.740, P = 0.050], source of infection (OR = 0.180, 95\% CI: 0.030-0.980, P = 0.049), and employment status (retired/unemployed vs. employed: OR = 29.430, 95\% CI, 1.050 - 822.330, P = 0.047) were significant independent predictors of severe COVID-19 infection. These individuals should be informed of methods to increase personal protection, and doctors should prevent these individuals from developing serious diseases. It is important to pay attention to the source of infection and timely medical treatment. This study showed that the clinical classification of COVID-19 was associated with patients with diabetes, source of infection, and retired/unemployed. Therefore in the clinical practice of COVID-19 should be more concern these factors. Although no statistical significance was found in smoking, drinking alcohol, BQ chewing, and severity of COVID-19 patients, more studies have confirmed that are harmful and risk factors for underlying diseases in the population. Health authorities should formulate policies to publicize the harmful effects of smoking, drinking, and betel nut chewing and promote a healthy lifestyle.

The lack of an effective treatment and the emergence of varied and complicated clinical courses in certain populations have rendered treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 difficult., METHODS: Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, a public tertiary acute care center located in Tokyo, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Japan, has been admitting patients with COVID-19 since February 2020. The present, retrospective, case-series study aimed to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the study institution., RESULTS: In total, 101 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital to receive inpatient care. Eleven patients (10.9\%) received ECMO, and nine patients (8.9\%) died during hospitalization after COVID-19 was diagnosed. A history of smoking and obesity were most commonly encountered among patients with a complicated clinical course. Most patients who died requested to be transferred to advanced palliative care in the early course of their hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of caring for these patients demonstrated a relatively lower mortality rate and higher survival rate in those with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement than previous reports from other countries and underscored the importance of proactive, advanced care planning in the early course of hospitalization.

	abstract = {In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn\&rsquo;t find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (\&gt;60 vs \&lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker\&rsquo;s lung compared to non-smoker\&rsquo;s lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We aimed to i) examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory virus infections a year previous; ii) compare current smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence; and iii) examine concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the medical notes. Methods: This retrospective case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. London smoking prevalence was obtained from the representative Annual Population Survey. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework. Findings: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had lower odds of being current smokers than patients admitted with other respiratory viruses (ORadj=0.55, 95\% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). Odds were equivocal for former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95\% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Current smoking in cases was significantly lower than expected from London prevalence (9.4\% vs. 12.9\%, p=.02). Smoking status recorded on the EHR deviated significantly from that recorded within the medical notes (χ2(3)=226.7, p\&lt;.001). Interpretation: In a single hospital trust in the UK, patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had reduced odds of being current smokers compared with patients admitted with other respiratory viruses a year previous.

In this study, we evaluated the seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to find predictors of infection in terms of symptoms, health status, and professions. Methods: Serological samples of 341 volunteers in a cohort in Marche Region, Italy, were analyzed for the presence of IgM and/or IgG immunoglobulins specific for the SARS-CoV-2. Contextually, an anamnestic questionnaire was administered. The binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of seroconversion. Results: Forty-nine subjects (14.4 \%) were found positive, without significant differences between gender and age groups. The predictors identified inside the variable categories “symptoms,” “risk factors” (smoking habit and established pathologies), and “professions” were the loss of taste and smell (OR, 8.563), cardiovascular diseases (OR, 2.912), and policeman profession (OR, 3.875), respectively. Conclusions: Although the limited number of subjects recruited in this study, our results could give important findings to be considered for planning preventive strategies in the view of the next COVID-19 waves.},

Of the 185 discharged cases, cancer patients had a significantly higher frequency of unplanned reintubation (7.1\% vs 0.9\%, p {\textless} 0.049), and required longer hospital stay (8.58 ± 6.50 days versus 12.83 ± 11.44 days, p {\textless} 0.002). Regression analysis revealed that obesity and active smoking were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusion: Outcomes in COVID-19 appear to be driven by obesity as well as active smoking, with no difference in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients.

            In this study, we aimed to investigate how COVID-19 affected cancer patients and whether this altered their survival outcomes. To do this, we examined data from a database of patients who have passed through our institution – a retrospective cohort analysis. Of the 206 patients we included in the study from this database, 57 had at least one preexisting cancer. Cancer patients tended to be older than noncancer patients. Of the 185 discharged patients, cancer patients required longer hospital stays, but there was no difference in mortality. Disease complications and intensive care unit admission with obesity and active smoking put patients in our cohort at increased risk of death. To conclude, outcomes in COVID-19 patients appear to be driven by obesity as well as active smoking, with no difference in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients.},

            Background:
            While
            
            pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) appears to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), data on patients with CVD and concomitant cancer is limited. Evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19.
            Methods:
            Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested.
            Results:
            Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8\%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3\%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-6.24; p{\textless}0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR=1.33, 95\%CI: 1.01 - 1.76; p=0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR=1.72, 95\%CI: 1.05-2.80; p=0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR=1.18, 95\% CI: 0.99 - 1.41; p=0.07).
            Conclusion:
            Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.},

Consecutive adult patients diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reference Hospitals were contacted to complete a survey reporting chemosensory loss, severity, timing and duration, nasal symptoms, smoking, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. In a cross-sectional study, we contacted 182 patients and 150 responded. Excluding the critically ill patients, 38\% reported gustatory and 41\% olfactory impairment (74\% severe/anosmia). Most of the patients (88\%) recovered their sense of smell by two months (median: 11.5 days; IQR: 13.3). For 23\%, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. There were no significant differences in the prevalence and duration of chemosensory loss between groups of varying COVID-19 severity, and sexes (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Moderate hyposmia resolved quicker than more severe loss (p = 0.04). Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent in COVID-19. Most patients recover fast, but nearly one out of ten have not recovered in two months.},

              Background
              The long-term consequences of COVID-19 remain unclear. There is concern a proportion of patients will progress to develop pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to assess the temporal change in CXR infiltrates in a cohort of patients following hospitalisation for COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between 20th March and 3rd June 2020. Patients were approached for standard-of-care follow-up 12-weeks after hospitalisation. Inpatient and follow-up CXRs were scored by the assessing clinician for extent of pulmonary infiltrates; 0–4 per lung (Nil = 0, {\textless} 25\% = 1, 25–50\% = 2, 51–75\% = 3, {\textgreater} 75\% = 4).
            
            
              Results
              101 patients with paired CXRs were included. Demographics: 53\% male with a median (IQR) age 53.0 (45–63) years and length of stay 9 (5–17.5) days. The median CXR follow-up interval was 82 (77–86) days with median baseline and follow-up CXR scores of 4.0 (3–5) and 0.0 (0–1) respectively. 32\% of patients had persistent CXR abnormality at 12-weeks. In multivariate analysis length of stay (LOS), smoking-status and obesity were identified as independent risk factors for persistent CXR abnormality. Serum LDH was significantly higher at baseline and at follow-up in patients with CXR abnormalities compared to those with resolution. A 5-point composite risk score (1-point each; LOS ≥ 15 days, Level 2/3 admission, LDH {\textgreater} 750 U/L, obesity and smoking-status) strongly predicted risk of persistent radiograph abnormality (0.81).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Persistent CXR abnormality 12-weeks post COVID-19 was common in this cohort. LOS, obesity, increased serum LDH, and smoking-status were risk factors for radiograph abnormality. These findings require further prospective validation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 from the medical history of patients, simplified models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic records were queried (02/26–07/14/2020) to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95\% CI 0.73–0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95\% CI 0.74–0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available.},

              Gender-related factors might affect vulnerability to Covid-19. The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients.
            
            
              Methods
              Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization.
            
            
              Results
              
                431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6\%) with a mean age of 67.0 ± 14.5 years (vs 67.8 ± 12.5 for males,
                p
                 = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO

                was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134–273] vs 238 mmHg [150–281],
                p
                 = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7\%

                p
                 = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1\% in women and 38.1\% in men (
                p 
                = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (
                p
                 = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (
                p
                 = 0.687).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men. Further studies are needed to better investigate the role of gender in clinical course and outcome of Covid-19.},

              Background
              Smoking negatively impacts COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. Evidence on whether smoking is associated with SARS-Co-V2 infection and having a positive test is scarce, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, where most of the world’s billion smokers live. The inconsistency in relevant findings calls for study designs and analyses to account for possible confounders including background characteristics and pre-existing co-morbidities, to disentangle the specific effect of smoking. In healthcare workers (HCWs) the frequency of exposure to COVID-19 cases adds another layer of risk that was not factored in previous studies. We examined the association of HCWs’ tobacco/nicotine use (never, former, and current use) with having a positive SARS-Co-V2 test result and symptoms suggestive of infection, accounting for demographics, exposures, and co-morbidities.
            
            
              Methods
              A prospective cohort study of 4040 healthcare workers with baseline and follow-up screening took place during April–June 2020 in 12 healthcare facilities in Cairo, Egypt. Data on demographics, tobacco/nicotine use (manufactured or roll-your-own cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco, and electronic devices), co-morbidities, symptoms, exposures, and SARS-Co-V2 investigations were analyzed. Multinomial and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
            
            
              Results
              
                Overall, 270/4040 (6.7, 95\%CI: 5.9–7.5) had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 479 (11.9\%) were current and 79 (2.0\%) were former tobacco/nicotine users. The proportion of positive tests was 7.0\% (243/3482, 95\%CI: 6.1–7.8) among never, 5.1\% (4/79, 95\%CI: 0.1–10.0) among former, and 4.8\% (23/479, 95\%CI: 2.9–6.7) among current users. HCWs’ SARS-CoV-2 test results did not vary significantly by single/multiple or daily/non-daily tobacco/nicotine use.

Additional population-based studies could use such preliminary evidence to investigate this controversial association.},

              Introduction
              It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aimed to evaluate the association between smoking and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
            
            
              Methods
              A matched case–control study was conducted using a large nationwide database. The case group included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the control group was randomly sampled from the general Korean population in the National Health Insurance Service database by matching sex, age, and region of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 4167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20 937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6\% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–0.62). When ex-smokers and current smokers were analyzed separately, similar results were obtained (current smoker OR = 0.33, CI = 0.28–0.38; ex-smoker OR = 0.81, CI = 0.72–0.91).
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study showed that smoking may not be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smoking tends to lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution.
            
            
              Implications
              It is unclear whether smokers are more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019. In this large nationwide study in South Korea, smoking tended to lower the risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and further confirmatory studies are required.},

E-cigarette and conventional cigarette use were ascertained using a novel electronic health record tool, and COVID-19 diagnosis was ascertained by a validated institutional registry. Logistic regression models were fit to assess whether current e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. A total of 69,264 patients who were over the age of 12 years, smoked cigarettes or vaped, and were sought medical care at Mayo Clinic between September 15, 2019 and November 30, 2020 were included. The average age was 51.5 years, 62.1\% were females and 86.3\% were white; 11.1\% were currently smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes and 5.1\% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who used only e-cigarettes were not more likely to have a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.93 [0.69-1.25], P = .628), whereas those who used only cigarettes had a decreased risk (OR 0.43 [0.35-0.53], P {\textless} .001). The OR for dual users fell between these 2 values (OR 0.67 [0.49-0.92], P = .013). Although e-cigarettes have the well-documented potential for harm, they do not appear to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This result suggests the hypothesis that any beneficial effects of conventional cigarette smoking on susceptibility are not mediated by nicotine.},

We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95\%CI 3.8–5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95\%CI 1.1–5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.},

              Background
              There is a paucity of literature on the relationship between pre-existing mental health conditions and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. The aim was to examine the association between pre-existing mental health diagnosis and COVID-19 outcomes (positive screen, hospitalization, mortality).
            
            
              Methods
              Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes.
            
            
              Results
              Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95\%CI 0.57–0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.70–0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models. Adults with bipolar disorder had significantly higher odds of hospitalization in fully adjusted models (OR 4.27, 95\% CI 2.06–8.86), and odds of hospitalization were significantly higher among those with externalizing disorders after adjusting for demographics (OR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.23–2.38). Mortality was significantly higher in the fully adjusted model for patients with bipolar disorder (hazard ratio 2.67, 95\% CI 1.07–6.67).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Adults with mental health disorders, while less likely to test positive for COVID-19, were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in the hospital. Study results suggest the importance of developing interventions that incorporate elements designed to address smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity counseling and other needs specific to this population to improve COVID-19 outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              In Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as confinement and social interaction limitations that paradoxically may have aggravated healthcare access disparities for pregnant women and accentuated health system weaknesses addressing high-risk patients’ pregnancies. Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020–February 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution.
            
            
              Results
              Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8\% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93\% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5\% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of {\textless} 19 or {\textgreater} 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60\% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4\% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8\%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death. Measures are needed to improve access to coordinated well-organized healthcare to reduce maternal deaths related to COVID-19 and pandemic collateral effects.},

	abstract = {Background
              COVID-19 Convalescent plasma (CCP) is safe and effective, particularly if given at an early stage of the disease. Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP.
            
            
              Patients and Methods
              Patients ≥18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed.
            
            
              Results
              CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43\%) were female. Twelve patients (27\%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Common cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. They provide a promising therapeutic target for monoclonal antibody production.},

              Background
              There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors and frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted this retrospective case–control study of 3100 HCWs between May and July 2020. HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were the cases (n=506) and those negative for SARS-CoV-2 were the controls (n=253). Univariate analysis was followed by multivariate analysis of key demographic, clinical and infection control variables.
            
            
              Results
              SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 16.32\% of HCWs. Nearly 45\% of infected HCWs were asymptomatic. The proportions of sanitation workers (24\% vs 8\%; p\&lt;0.0001) and technicians (10\% vs 4\%; p=0.0002) were higher and that of doctors was lower among cases as compared with controls (23\% vs 43\%; p\&lt;0.0001). On univariate analysis, the type of HCW, smoking, lack of training, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use and taking no or fewer doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be significant. On multivariate analysis, the type of HCW (risk ratio [RR] 1.67 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} 1.34 to 2.08], p\&lt;0.0001), inappropriate PPE use (RR 0.63 [95\% CI 0.44 to 0.89], p=0.01) and taking fewer doses of HCQ (RR 0.92 [95\% CI 0.86 to 0.99], p=0.03) were significant.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 16\% among HCWs. Being a sanitation worker, inappropriate PPE use and lack of HCQ prophylaxis predisposed HCWs to SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

              Cigarette smoking has been proven to be a risk factor in the development of many diseases. However, it remains controversial with respect to the relationship of smoking with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of smoking in COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 622 patients with COVID-19 in China were enrolled in the study. Corresponding clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were employed to analyze the association of smoking with survival in patients with COVID-19.
            
            
              Results
              
                Smoking was statistically significant comparing non-survivors and survivors of patients with COVID-19 (
                P
                = 0.007). Males had higher proportion of smoking than females (91.9\% vs. 8.1\%,
                P
                \&lt; 0.001). Compared with the non-smoker, there was significant statistical difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in smoking patients with COVID-19 (9.7\% vs. 3.4\%,
                P
                = 0.017). White blood cell count (6.3 vs. 5.4;

                P
                = 0.045). After adjustment for age, gender and underlying diseases, patients with smoking still had higher risk of mortality than that of non-smoking patients (hazard ratio[HR] 1.897, 95\% confidence interval [CI]1.058–3.402,
                P

              Conclusion
              Smoking was thought to be a risk factor in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 and smoking patients might have a higher risk of mortality than that of the non-smoking patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Lombardy is the Italian region most affected by COVID-19. We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43\%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4\% vs 13.5\%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9\% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1\% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2\% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure.},

              Background
              Emerging evidence suggests many people have persistent symptoms after acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC).
            
            
              Methods
              We used a population-based probability survey of adults with COVID-19 in Michigan. Living noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System with COVID-19 onset through mid-April 2020 were eligible for selection (N = 28 000). Among 2000 selected, 629 completed the survey between June–December 2020. We estimated PASC prevalence, defined as persistent symptoms ≥30 (30-day COVID-19) or ≥60 (60-day COVID-19) days post–COVID-19 onset, overall and by sociodemographic and clinical factors. We used modified Poisson regression to produce adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for potential risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              The analytic sample (n = 593) was predominantly female (56.1\%), aged ≥45 years (68.2\%), and non-Hispanic White (46.3\%) or Black (34.8\%). Thirty- and 60-day COVID-19 were highly prevalent (52.5\% and 35.0\%), even among nonhospitalized respondents (43.7\% and 26.9\%) and respondents reporting mild symptoms (29.2\% and 24.5\%). Respondents reporting very severe (vs mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30-day COVID-19 (aPR, 2.25; 95\% CI, 1.46–3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60-day COVID-19 (aPR, 1.71; 95\% CI: 1.02–2.88). Hospitalized (vs nonhospitalized) respondents had {\textasciitilde}40\% higher prevalence of both 30-day (aPR, 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.12–1.69) and 60-day (aPR, 1.40; 95\% CI: 1.02–1.93) COVID-19.
            
            
              Conclusions
              PASC is highly prevalent among cases reporting severe initial symptoms and, to a lesser extent, cases reporting mild and moderate symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background
              As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. Hence, we performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of both infections.
            
            
              Methodology/Principal findings
              All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% Confidence Intervals (95\%CI) were assessed. Over a two-month study period, we diagnosed 80 COVID-19, 61 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases eligible to multivariate analysis. Among these, we identified delayed presentation ({\textgreater}3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.91, 95\% confidence interval 1.07–3.39), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95\%CI 2.21–6.55) and anosmia (OR 7.80, 95\%CI 4.20–14.49) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.17, 95\%CI 2.69–14.14), headache (OR 5.03, 95\%CI 1.88–13.44) and retro-orbital pain (OR 5.55, 95\%CI 2.51–12.28) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95\%CI 0.09–0.79) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were associated with OFIs.
            
            
              Conclusions/Significance
              Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates. At clinical presentation, nine basic clinical and epidemiological indicators may help to distinguish COVID-19 or dengue from each other and other febrile illnesses.},

There is a paucity of data from South East Asian Region related to the predictors of clinical outcomes in these patients. This formed the basis of conducting our study. Methods:This was an analytical cross-sectional study. Demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data of 125 patients was collected on admission. The study outcome was death or discharge after recovery. For univariate analysis, unpaired t-test, Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact test were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and few laboratory parameters. Logistic regression was applied for multivariate analysis. Results:Elderly age, ischemic heart disease and smoking were significantly associated with mortality. Elevated levels of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced lymphocyte counts were the predictors of mortality. The ROCs for SOFA score curve showed a cut-off value ≥ 3.5 (sensitivity- 91.7\% and specificity- 87.5\%), for IL-6 the cut-off value was ≥ 37.9 (sensitivity- 96\% and specificity- 78\%) and for lymphocyte counts, a cut off was calculated to be less than and equal to 1.46 x 109per litre (sensitivity-75.2\%and specificity- 83.3\%). Conclusion:Old age, smoking history, ischemic heart disease and laboratory parameters including elevated D-dimer, raised LDH and low lymphocyte counts at baseline are associated with COVID-19 mortality. A higher SOFA score at admission is a poor prognosticator in COVID-19 patients.},

The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020, with particularly high case fatality ratio (CFR). To estimate seroprevalence, underreported infections, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged ≥14 years in June/July 2020, we conducted a population-based study including home visits for the elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests. Latent class analysis yielded 8.6\% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, a factor of underreported infections of 5.0, and 2.5\% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the factor of underreported infections was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for ≥85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were {\textless}0.5\% below 60 years of age, 1.0\% for age 60–69, and 13.2\% for age 70+. Senior care homes accounted for 45\% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5\% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4\% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.},

              Prior diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is associated with increased length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality from COVID-19. Associations between substance use, venous thromboembolism (VTE) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its effects on LOS or mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 remain unknown.
            
            
              Objective
              This study identified risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes among patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              Case–control study was conducted of patients with prior diagnosis of HF hospitalised with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care centre from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2021. Patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 with risk factors were compared with those without risk factors for clinical characteristics, LOS and mortality. Multivariate regression was conducted to identify multiple predictors of increased LOS and in-hospital mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19.
            
            
              Results
              Total of 211 patients with HF were hospitalised with COVID-19. Women had longer LOS than men (9 days vs 7 days; p{\textless}0.001). Compared with patients without PAD or ischaemic stroke, patients with PAD or ischaemic stroke had longer LOS (7 days vs 9 days; p=0.012 and 7 days vs 11 days, p{\textless}0.001, respectively). Older patients (aged 65 and above) had increased in-hospital mortality compared with younger patients (adjusted OR: 1.04; 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.07; p=0.036).

              Methods:
              One hundred and thirty-eight patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection at Wuhan Union Hospital, between February 8 and March 31, 2020, were included in the study analysis. General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records.

              Results:
              Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (

              Conclusion:
              Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.},

              Some 226 (1.5\%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95\% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62\%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age {\textgreater}70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19).
            
            
              Conclusions
              In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care.
            
            
              Methods
              Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50\% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables.
            
            
              Results
              Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age{\textgreater}50 years, measured temperature{\textgreater}37.5°C, oxygen saturation{\textless}95\%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.79–0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6\% (94.8–96.3\%), specificity of 20.0\% (19.0–21.0\%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19–0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., {\textgreater}75\% probability with +5 or more points).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.},

              To assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among health careworkers (HCWs) in our university hospital and verify the risk of acquiring the infection according to work area.
            
            
              Design
              Cross-sectional study.
            
            
              Setting
              Monocentric, Italian, third-level university hospital.
            
            
              Participants
              All the employees of the hospital on a voluntary base, for a total of 4055 participants among 4572 HCWs (88.7\%).
            
            
              Primary and secondary outcome measures
              Number of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology according to working area. Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases).
            
            
              Results
              From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6\%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3\% vs 7.3\%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5\%, p{\textless}0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6\%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9\%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5\%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p{\textless}0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95\% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95\% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2\%) HCWs with positive IgG levels. Declared exposure to a suspected/confirmed case was more frequently associated (p{\textless}0.001) with positive serology when the contact was a family member (19/94, 20.2\%) than a patient or colleague (78/888, 8.8\%).
            
            
              Conclusions
              SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred undetected in a large fraction of HCWs and it was not associated with working in COVID-19 frontline areas. Beyond the hospital setting, exposure within the community represents an additional source of infection for HCWs.},

              Background
              During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care workers (HCWs) at the frontline have been largely exposed to infected patients, running a high risk of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
              Since limiting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care setting is crucial to avoid the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, we want to share our experience as an early hit hospital where standard infection control practices have been conscientiously applied and effective. We believe that our example, as first and hardest hit country, might be a warning and aid not only for those who have been hit later, but also for a second fearful wave of contagion. In addition, we want to offer an insight on modifiable risk factors for HWs-related infection.
            
            
              Methods
              Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs, which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression.
            
            
              Results
              The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33\% (9.72–13.21). Working in a COVID-19 ward, being a former smoker (versus being a person who never smoked) and BMI was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas being a current smoker was negatively associated with this variable.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Assuming an equal accessibility and proper use of personal protective equipment of all the HCWs of our Hospital, the great and more prolonged contact with COVID-19 patients remains the crucial risk factor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, increased and particular care needs to be focused specifically on the most exposed HCWs groups, which should be safeguarded. Furthermore, in order to limit the risk of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the HCWs mild symptoms of COVID-19 should be considered when evaluating the potential benefits of universal staff testing.},

              The purpose of the present study was to investigate body mass index, multi-morbidity, and COVID-19 Risk Score as predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
            
            
              Patients
              Patients from this study are from a well-characterized patient cohort collected at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 2020 and May 23, 2020; with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays from nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
            
            
              Measures
              Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The data included: date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, medications (active COVID-19 agents), weight and height (from which the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, history of smoking, and comorbid conditions to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) multi-morbidity score. An additional COVID-19 Risk Score was also included. Outcomes included hospital admission, ICU admission, and death.
            
            
              Results
              Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact on mortality or hospital admission. Age, sex, and race (white/Latino, white/non-Latino, other, did not disclose) were adjusted for in the model. Patients with higher COVID-19 Risk Scores had a significantly higher likelihood of being at least admitted to the hospital (HR = 1.80; 95\% CI = 1.30, 2.50; P {\textless} .001), or experiencing death or inpatient admission (includes ICU admissions) (HR = 1.20; 95\% CI = 1.02, 1.42; P = .028). Age was the only statistically significant demographic predictor, but obesity was not a significant predictor of any of the outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Age and COVID-19 Risk Scores were significant predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Further work should examine the properties of the COVID-19 Risk Factors Scale.},

              Backgrounds
              The reports of neurological symptoms are increasing in cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death.
            
            
              Methods
              Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements.
            
            
              Results
              
                We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97\%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1\%), cough (76.1\%), fatigue (36.1\%), and shortness of breath (27.6\%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3\%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6\%; anosmia: 41.4\%; dysguesia: 100\%). They were more common among females (69.7\%) and non-smokers (66.7\%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8\%), headaches (12.6\%), and dizziness (11.9\%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (
                n
                 = 10) and status epilepticus (
                n
                 = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2\% after 8 weeks and 97.3\% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9\%) and phantosmia (9.0\%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge. The demyelinating myelitis (
                n
                 = 1) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (
                n =
                 1) were also found during follow-up.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Neurological symptoms were found to be prevalent among individuals with COVID-19 disease and should not be under-estimated during the current pandemic outbreak.},

              Background
              In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries mandated staying at home to reduce transmission. This study examined the association between living arrangements (house occupancy numbers) and outcomes in COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              Study population was drawn from the COPE Study, a multicentre cohort study. House occupancy was defined as: living alone; living with one other person; living with multiple other people; or living in a nursing/residential home. Outcomes were time from admission to mortality and discharge (Cox regression), and Day-28 mortality (logistic regression), analyses were adjusted for key comorbidities and covariates including admission: age; sex, smoking; heart failure; admission CRP; COPD; eGFR, frailty and others.
            
            
              Results
              1584 patients were included from 13 hospitals across UK and Italy: 676 (42.7\%) were female, 907 (57.3\%) were male, median age was 74 years (range: 19-101). At 28 days, 502 (31.7\%) had died. Median admission CRP was 67, 82, 79.5 and 83mg/L for those living alone, with someone else, in a house of multiple occupancy and in a nursing/residential home, respectively. Compared to living alone, living with anyone was associated with increased mortality: within a couple (aHR 1.39, 95\%CI 1.09-1.77, p = 0.007); living in a house of multiple occupancy (aHR=1.67, 95\%CI 1.17-2.38, p = 0.005); and living in a residential home (aHR=1.36, 95\%CI 1.03-1.80, p = 0.031).
            
            
              Conclusion
              For patients hospitalised with COVID-19, those living with one or more people had an increased association with mortality, they also exhibited higher CRP indicating increased disease severity suggesting they delayed seeking care.},

This study aimed at determining the association between presence of chronic diseases and smoking behaviors with the development of ARDS among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-‘Aisyiyah–affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6\%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95\% CI 1.16–36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95\% CI 1.05–3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95\% CI 1.02–5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.19–0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.06–0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.03–4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95\% CI 0.06–0.76). \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

            Properly conducted serological survey can help determine infection disease true spread. This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias. A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity. 66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020. Naïve seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0\% (7.2–10.8) by CMIA and 10.5\% (8.6–12.4) by ELISA. Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4\% (5.7–9.2) and 9.1\% (7.2–10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively. The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing. Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits. These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation. Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity.},

Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19. Results conflict on vitamin D’s plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19. We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates. Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence. Levels {\textless} 12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death. Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment. Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death. Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels {\textless} 12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality.},

Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19.  This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6\% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention.  Public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use are also needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            International guidelines for testing potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients receiving non-surgical anticancer therapies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are currently lacking. The value of routinely testing staff treating cancer patients is not known.
          
          
            Methods
            Patient-facing oncology department staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic consented to have a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using a laboratory Luminex-based assay and a rapid point-of-care (POC) assay on 2 occasions 28 days apart in June and July 2020.
          
          
            Findings
            
              434 participants were recruited: nurses (58·3\%), doctors (21·2\%), radiographers (10·4\%) and administrators (10·1\%). 82\% were female; median age 40-years (range 19-66). 26·3\% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1·4\% tested PCR-positive prior to June 2020. All were PCR-negative at both study day 1 and 28. 18·4\% were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive on day 1 by Luminex, of whom 42·5\% also tested positive by POC. 47·5\% of Luminex sero-positives had antibodies to both nucleocapsid (N) and surface (S) antigens. Nurses (21·3\%) and doctors (17·4\%) had higher prevalence trends of Luminex sero-positivity compared with administrators (13·6\%) and radiographers (8·9\%) (
              p
              =0.2). 38\% of sero-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 1·9-fold higher odds than sero-negative participants (
              p
              =0·01). 400 participants re-tested on day 28: 13·3\% were Luminex sero-positive of whom 92·5\% were previously positive and 7·5\% newly positive. Nurses (16·5\%) had the highest seroprevalence trend amongst staff groups (
              p
              =0·07). 32·5\% of day 1 sero-positives became sero-negative by day 28: the majority being previously reactive to the N-antigen only (
              p
              {\textless}0·0001).
            
          
          
            Interpretation
            The high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG sero-positivity in oncology nurses, and the high decline of positivity over 4 weeks supports regular antigen and antibody testing in this staff group for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine patient care prior to availability of a vaccine.
          
          
            Funding
            ACT, NHS
          
          
            Evidence before this study
            To identify studies involving oncology healthcare workers and SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, we searched PubMed and Medrxiv for articles published between January 1 and July 31 using the following search terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “oncology staff”, “healthcare workers” without language restriction. To date, no large study has specifically reported and tracked patient-facing oncology staff SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
          
          
            Added value of this study
            To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study specifically investigating SARS-CoV-2 exposure in UK patient-facing oncology staff who were at work during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and June 2020. 18·4\% of staff were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of June 2020 suggesting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 32·5\% of those antibody-positive cases became antibody-negative 28 days after the first sample collection. The highest seroprevalence rates at both time points were recorded in nurses.
          
          
            Implications of all the available evidence
            These results justify incorporating SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing of oncology nurses into international guidelines for managing cancer patients treated with non-surgical anticancer treatments prior to availability of a functional vaccine.},

              Diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16\%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0\%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95\% CI 1.47–1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test:
              P
               = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95\% CI 2.86–3.40) for patients 20–39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95\% CI 1.06–1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95\% CI 1.58–1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95\% CI 1.12–1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.98–1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95\% CI 1.73–1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older. Our findings should be verified in other populations.},

            Background
            
              In the 2
              nd
              year of the Covid-19 pandemic, knowledge about the dynamics of the infection in the general population is still limited. Such information is essential for health planners, as many of those infected show no or only mild symptoms and thus, escape the surveillance system. We therefore aimed to describe the course of the pandemic in the Munich general population living in private households from April 2020 to January 2021.
            
          
          
            Methods
            
              The KoCo19 baseline study took place from April to June 2020 including 5313 participants (age 14 years and above). From November 2020 to January 2021, we could again measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in 4,433 of the baseline participants (response 83\%). Participants were offered a self-sampling kit to take a capillary blood sample (dry blood spot; DBS). Blood was analysed using the Elecsys
              ®
              Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche). Questionnaire information on socio-demographics and potential risk factors assessed at baseline was available for all participants. In addition, follow-up information on health-risk taking behaviour and number of personal contacts outside the household (N=2768) as well as leisure time activities (N=1263) were collected in summer 2020.
            
          
          
            Results
            Weighted and adjusted (for specificity and sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence at follow-up was 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.9-4.3\%) as compared to 1.8\% (95\% CI 1.3-3.4\%) at baseline. 91\% of those tested positive at baseline were also antibody-positive at follow-up. While sero-prevalence increased from early November 2021 to January 2021, no indication of geospatial clustering across the city of Munich was found, although cases clustered within households. Taking baseline result and time to follow-up into account, men and participants in the age group 20-34 years were at the highest risk of sero-positivity. In the sensitivity analyses, differences in health-risk taking behaviour, number of personal contacts and leisure time activities partly explained these differences.
          
          
            Conclusion
            
              The number of citizens in Munich with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was still below 5\% during the 2
              nd
              wave of the pandemic. Antibodies remained present in the majority of baseline participants. Besides age and sex, potentially confounded by differences in behaviour, no major risk factors could be identified. Non-pharmaceutical public health measures are thus still important.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objective
            Clinical sequelae have not been well characterized during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 among adults 18 to 65 years old, and this study sought to fill that gap by evaluating excess risk and relative hazards for developing incident clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase.
          
          
            Design
            Retrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.
          
          
            Setting
            This study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.
          
          
            Participants
            Individuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            Over 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95\% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.
          
          
            Results
            This study found 14\% of adults ≤65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (≤50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.
          
          
            Summary Box
            
              What is already known on this topic
              Small observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults ≤65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.
            
            
              What this study adds
              This study found 14\% of individuals ≤65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults ≤ 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated. These results indicate where additional diagnostic follow-up, rehabilitation, and symptom management may be warranted among younger adults with milder infection.},

            Objectives
            Currently available COVID-19 prognostic models have focused on laboratory and radiological data obtained following admission. However, these tests are not available on initial assessment or in resource-limited settings. We aim to develop and validate a prediction model, based on clinical history and examination findings on initial diagnosis of COVID-19, to identify patients at risk of critical outcomes.
          
          
            Methods
            We used data from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide multicenter cohort of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 132 centers in Spain. Clinical signs and symptoms, demographic variables, and medical history ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive model. We externally validated the final model in a separate cohort of patients admitted at less-complex hospitals ({\textless} 300 beds).We undertook decision curve analysis to assess the clinical usefulness of the predictive model. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit.
          
          
            Results
            
              There were 10,433 patients, 7,850 (primary outcome 25.1\%) in the development cohort and 2,583 (primary outcome 27.0\%) in the validation cohort. Variables in the final model included: age, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, dyspnea, tachypnea, confusion, systolic blood pressure, and SpO
              2
              ≤93\% or oxygen requirement.The C-statistic in the development cohort was 0.823 (95\% CI,0.813-0.834). On external validation, the C-statistic was 0.792 (95\% CI,0.772-0.812). The model showed a positive net benefit for threshold probabilities between 3\% and 79\%.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            Among patients presenting with COVID-19, the model based on easily-obtained clinical information had good discrimination and generalizability for identifying patients at risk of critical outcomes without the need of additional testing. The online calculator provided would facilitate triage of patients during the pandemic. This study could provide a useful tool for decision-making in health systems under pandemic pressure and resource-limited settings.},

            Purpose
            to evaluate the association between anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgM and IgG antibodies with viral RNA load in plasma, the frequency of antigenemia and with the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
          
          
            Methods
            anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies levels, viral RNA load and antigenemia were profiled in plasma of 92 adult patients in the first 24 hours following ICU admission. The impact of these variables on 30-day mortality was assessed by using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis.
          
          
            Results
            
              non survivors showed more frequently absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG and IgM antibodies than survivors (26.3\% vs 5.6\% for IgM and 18.4\% vs 5.6\% for IgG), and a higher frequency of antigenemia (47.4\% vs 22.2\%) (
              p
              {\textless}0.05). Non survivors showed lower concentrations of anti-S IgG and IgM and higher viral RNA loads in plasma, which were associated to increased 30-day mortality and decreased survival mean time. [Adjusted HR (CI95\%),

              ]: [S IgM (AUC ≥60): 0.48 (0.24; 0.97), 0.040]; [S IgG (AUC ≥237): 0.47 (0.23; 0.97), 0.042]; [Antigenemia (+): 2.45 (1.27; 4.71), 0.007]; [N1 viral load (≥ 2.156 copies/mL): 2.21 (1.11; 4.39),0.024]; [N2 viral load (≥ 3.035 copies/mL): 2.32 (1.16; 4.63), 0.017]. Frequency of antigenemia was {\textgreater}2.5-fold higher in patients with absence of antibodies. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies correlated inversely with viral RNA load.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            absence / insufficient levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies following ICU admission is associated to poor viral control, evidenced by increased viral RNA loads in plasma, higher frequency of antigenemia, and also to increased 30-day mortality.
          
          
            Take-home message
            absent or low levels of antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV- 2 at ICU admission is associated to an increased risk of mortality, higher frequency of antigenemia and higher viral RNA loads in plasma. Profiling anti-SARS-CoV-2 s antibodies at ICU admission could help to predict outcome and to better identify those patients potentially deserving replacement treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.},

            Rationale
            The progress of COVID-19 from moderate to severe may be precipitous, while the heterogenous characteristics of the disease pose challenges to the management of these patients.
          
          
            Objectives
            To characterize the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during two successive waves.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 (SPARCOL) study and collected data from consecutive patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit from April 1
              st

            Measurements and Main Results
            
              Of 252 patients, 81 (32\%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Of them, 17 (20.9\%) were intubated during the first wave, while 64 (79\%) during the second wave. The most prominent difference between the two waves was the overall survival (first wave 58.9\%
              vs.
              second wave 15.6\%, adjusted p-value=0.006). This difference is reflected in the prolonged hospitalization during the first wave. The mean ICU length of stay (19.1
              vs.
              11.7 days, p=0.022), hospital length of stay (28.5
              vs.
              17.1 days, p=0.012), and days on ventilator (16.7
              vs.
              11.5, p=0.13) were higher during the first wave. A significant difference between the two waves was the development of bradycardia. In the first wave, 2 (11.7\%) patients developed sinus bradycardia only after admission to the intensive care unit, while in the second wave, 63 (98.4\%) patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            Survival of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower during the second wave. The majority of these patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.},

            Importance
            Strength and muscle mass are predictors of relevant clinical outcomes in critically ill patients, but in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remains to be determined.
          
          
            Objective
            To investigate whether muscle strength or muscle mass are predictive of hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            Prospective observational study.
          
          
            Setting
            Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo.
          
          
            Participants
            
              One hundred ninety-six patients were evaluated. Ten patients did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and were excluded from the analyses. The sample comprised patients of both sexes (50\% male) with a mean age (SD) of 59 (±15) years, body mass index of 29.5 (±6.9) kg/m
              2
              . The prevalence of current smoking patients was 24.7\%, and more prevalent coexisting conditions were hypertension (67.7\%), obesity (40.9\%), and type 2 diabetes (36.0\%). Mean (SD) LOS was 8.6 days (7.7); 17.0\% of the patients required intensive care; 3.8\% used invasive mechanical ventilation; and 6.6\% died during the hospitalization period.
            
          
          
            Main outcome
            The outcome was LOS, defined as time from hospital admission to medical discharge.
          
          
            Results
            
              The crude Hazard Ratio (HR) for LOS was greatest for handgrip strength comparing the strongest
              vs
              . other patients (1.54 [95\%CI: 1.12 – 2.12; p = 0.008]). Evidence of an association between increased handgrip strength and shorter hospital stay was also identified when handgrip strength was standardized according to the sex-specific mean and standard deviation (1.23 [95\%CI: 1.06 – 1.19; p = 0.008]). The magnitude of these associations remained consistent and statistically significant after adjusting for other covariates. Mean LOS was shorter for the strongest patients (7.5 ± 6.1 days)
              vs
              . others (9.2 ± 8.4 days). Evidence of associations were also present for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. The crude HR identified shorter hospital stay for patients with greater sex-specific standardized values (1.17 [95\%CI: 1.01 – 1.36; p = 0.037]); however, we found increased uncertainty in the estimate with the addition of other covariates (1.18 [95\%CI: 0.97 – 1.43; p = 0.092]). Evidence was also obtained associating longer hospital stays for patients with the lowest values for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (0.69 [95\%CI: 0.50 – 0.95; p = 0.025). Mean LOS for the patients with the lowest muscle cross-sectional area was longer (10.8 ± 8.8 days)
              vs
              . others (7.7 ± 7.2 days).
            
          
          
            Conclusions and Relevance
            Muscle strength and mass assessed upon hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, which stresses the value of muscle health in prognosis of this disease.

            Key points
            
              Question
              Do muscle strength and muscle mass predict hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 patients?
            
            
              Findings
              
                In this prospective observational study that included 186 hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, we observed that LOS was shorter among patients in the highest tertile of strength (assessed by handgrip)
                vs
                . those in the mid/lowest tertiles (crude Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.54, 95\%CI: 1.12-2.12). In addition, LOS was longer among patients in the lowest tertile of muscle cross-sectional area (assessed by ultrasound imaging)
                vs
                . those in the mid/highest tertiles (HR: 0.69, 95\%CI: 0.50 – 0.95).
              
            
            
              Meaning
              Muscle strength and mass assessed on hospital admission are predictors of LOS in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, suggesting that muscle health may be protective in this disease.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          New information is emerging about SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and immunity, but little of this information comes from low- and middle-income countries or from patients receiving care in the outpatient setting. The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June–October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38\%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64\%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22\%) or by serology (n = 9, 14\%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.},

            Background
            In a proportion of patients recovered from the acute COVID-19 phase, a variable range of symptoms has been observed to persist for at least 6-months.
          
          
            Objectives
            The main aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-related symptoms 12-months after the onset of mild-to-moderate disease.
          
          
            Methods
            Prospective study based on structured questionnaires and additional outcomes.
          
          
            Results
            304/354 patients completing the survey at baseline also completed the follow-up interview (85.9\%; median [range] age, 47 [18-76] years; 185 [60.9\%] women). Persistence of at least one symptom at 12-months follow-up was reported by 161 patients (53.0\%). The most commonly reported symptom of long COVID was felt tired (n=83, 27.3\%), followed by smell or taste impairment (n=67, 22.0\%), shortness of breath (n=39, 12.8\%) and muscle pain (n=28, 9.2\%). Being females (OR=1.64; 95\% CI: 1.00-2.70), aged between 40-54 (OR=1.92; 95\% CI: 1.07-3.44), having a BMI ≥25 (OR=1.67; 95\% CI: 1.00-2.78), and experiencing more symptoms during the acute phase of the disease (OR=8.71 for ≥8 symptoms; 95\% CI: 2.73-27.76) were associated with long COVID. Persistence of symptoms showed a significant impact on quality of life (p{\textless}0.0001) and depression scale scores (p=0.0102).
          
          
            Conclusion
            More than half of patients with previous mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 complained the persistence of at least one symptom 12-months after the onset of the illness.},

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the COVID-19 pandemic among citizens 15 years or older in Denmark living in social housing (SH) areas.
          
          
            Methods
            
              As part of “Testing Denmark”, a nationwide sero-epidemiological surveillance survey, we conducted a study between January 8
              th
              and January 31
              st
              , 2021 with recruitment in 13 selected SH areas in Denmark. Participants were offered a point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody test and a questionnaire concerning previous testing (viral throat- and nasopharyngeal swab or antibody test), test results for COVID-19, demographics, household characteristics, employment, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and history of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Data on seroprevalence from Danish blood donors in same period using a total Ig ELISA assay were used as a proxy for the general Danish population.
            
          
          
            Findings
            Of the 13,279 included participants, 2,296 (17.3\%) were seropositive (mean age 46.6 (SD 16.4) years, 54.2\% female), which was 3 times higher than in the general Danish population (mean age 41.7 (SD 14.1) years, 48.5\% female) in the same period (5.8\%, risk ratios (RR) 2.96, 95\% CI 2.78-3.16, p{\textgreater}0.001). Seropositivity was higher among males than females (RR 1.1, 95\% CI 1.05-1.22\%, p=0.001) and increased with age, with an OR seropositivity of 1.03 for each 10-year increase in age (95\% CI 1.00-1.06, p=0.031). Close contact with COVID-19-infected individuals was associated with a higher risk of infection, especially among members of the same households (OR 5.0, 95\% CI 4.1-6.2 p{\textless}0,001). Adjusted for age, gender and region living at least 4 people in a household significantly increased the OR of seropositivity (OR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.1-1.6, p=0.02) as did living in a multi-generational household (OR 1.3 per generation, 95\% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.007). Only 1.6\% of participants reported not following any of the national COVID-19 recommendations. Anosmia (RR 3.2 95\% CI 2.8-3.7, p{\textless}0.001) and ageusia (RR 3.3, 95\% CI 2.9-3.8, p{\textless}0.001) were strongest associated with seropositivity.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Danish citizens living in SH areas of low socioeconomic status had a three times higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence compared to the general Danish population. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in males and increased with age. Living in multiple generations or more than four persons in a household was an independent risk factor for being seropositive. Results of this study can be used for future consideration of the need for preventive measures in the populations living in SH areas.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The efficacy of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is unclear. While most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content may influence patient outcomes.
          We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset. Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 mL of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 days. The effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression.
          The trial was terminated at 78\% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. 940 patients were randomized and 921 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4\%) in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0\%) in the standard of care arm; relative risk (RR) 1.16 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43; p=0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4\% vs. 26.4\%; RR=1.27, 95\% CI 1.02-1.57, p=0.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standard log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (OR=0.74; 0.57-0.95 and OR=0.66; 0.50-0.87, respectively), while IgG against the full transmembrane Spike protein increased it (OR=1.53, 95\% CI 1.14-2.05).
          Convalescent plasma did not reduce the risk of intubation or death at 30 days among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with unfavourable antibody profiles may be associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to standard care.

            Objective
            To investigate the association between Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or Combined Oral Contraception (COCP) use, and the likelihood of death in women with COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            A cohort study
          
          
            Setting
            465 general practices in England within the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care database.
          
          
            Population
            1,863,478 women aged over 18 years
          
          
            Methods
            We identified a cohort of women with COVID-19 from the computerised medical records of the RCGP RSC database. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between HRT or COCP use, and all-cause mortality among women with COVID-19 in unadjusted and adjusted models.
          
          
            Results
            There were 5451 COVID-19 cases within the cohort. HRT was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.22, 95\%□CI 0.05 to 0.94). There were no reported events for all-cause mortality in women prescribed COCPs. This prevented further examination of the impact of COCP.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Women on HRT with COVID-19 had a lower likelihood of death. Further work is needed in larger cohorts to examine the association of COCP in COVID-19. Our findings support the current hypothesis that oestrogens may contribute a protective effect against COVID-19 severity.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            BACKGROUND
            The lethality rate of COVID-19 in Mexico is one of the highest worldwide, but in-hospital factors associated with this increased rate have yet to be explored. This study aims to evaluate those factors that could be associated with mortality at 28-days in critically ill COVID-19 patients in Mexico.
          
          
            METHODS
            
              This is a retrospective analysis of the patients included in the clinical trial (
              NCT04381858
              ) which recruited patients with severe COVID-19 with high oxygen requirement or mechanical ventilation from May to October 2020. The primary outcome, death at 28, was analyzed.
            
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              Between May and October 2020, 196 predominantly male patients (n=122, 62.2\%) with an average of 58.1 years (± 15.5), were included in the cohort. Mortality at 28 days was 44.3 \% (n= 84). Patients included in the second trimester had a greater mortality rate when compared with those recruited in the first trimester (54.1
              vs
              32.1, p{\textless} 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the detected protective factors were the use of fentanyl HR 0.51 (95\%CI 0.31 – 0.85, p=0.01), the use of antibiotics HR 0.22 (95\% CI 0.13 – 0.36, p{\textless}0.01), and a previously healthy state (no comorbidities other than obesity) HR 0.58 (95\%CI 0.35 – 0.94, p =0.03); risk factors were severe kidney injury (AKIN3) HR 1.74 (95\%CI 1.04 – 2.9, p=0.035), elevated D-Dimer levels HR 1.02 (95\%CI 1.007 – 1.04, p=0.005), shock OR 5.8 (2.4 – 13.8, p{\textless}0.01), and recruitment in the second trimester OR 2.3 ((1.1 – 4.8, p=0.02).
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            In-hospital mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients has increased in our center. The appropriate use of antibiotics, the type of sedation, and AKIN3 are modifiable factors directly related to this increased mortality. The increase in mortality observed in the second trimester is explained by hospital overcrowding that began in August 2020.},

	abstract = {Background
            The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, and employment following hospitalisation is poorly understood.
          
          
            Methods
            PHOSP-COVID is a multi-centre, UK, observational study of adults discharged from hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 involving an assessment between two- and seven-months later including detailed symptom, physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function.
          
          
            Findings
            We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36\% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69\% white ethnicity, 27\% mechanical ventilation, and 50\% had at least two co-morbidities. At follow-up only 29\% felt fully recovered, 20\% had a new disability, and 19\% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, two or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17\%), 2) Severe (21\%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17\%), 4) Mild (46\%), with 3\%, 7\%, 36\% and 43\% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity.
          
          
            Interpretation
            We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and four different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health five months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide-access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services.

            Background
            While SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus isolation in outpatients with COVID-19 has been associated with viral RNA levels and symptom duration, little is known about the host, disease and viral determinants of infectious virus detection.
          
          
            Methods
            COVID-19 adult outpatients were enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Clinical symptoms were recorded via patient diary. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to quantitate SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and for infectious virus isolation in Vero E6-cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in serum using a validated ELISA assay.
          
          
            Results
            
              Among 204 participants with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID19, the median nasopharyngeal viral RNA was 6.5 (IQR 4.7-7.6 log
              10
              copies/mL), and 26\% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgM, IgG, and/or total Ig) at baseline. Infectious virus was recovered in 7\% of participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to 58\% of participants without antibodies (probability ratio (PR)=0.12, 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.36; p=0.00016). Infectious virus isolation was also associated with higher levels of viral RNA (mean RNA difference +2.6 log
              10
              , 95\% CI: 2.2, 3.0; p{\textless}0.0001) and fewer days since symptom onset (PR=0.79, 95\% CI: 0.71, 0.88 per day; p{\textless}0.0001).
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is strongly associated with clearance of infectious virus isolation. Seropositivity and viral RNA levels are likely more reliable markers of infectious virus clearance than subjective measure of COVID-19 symptom duration. Virus-targeted treatment and prevention strategies should be administered as early as possible and ideally before seroconversion.

            Objective
            Long-term data following SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. We aimed to characterize the medium and long-term clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19, and to identify predictors of long-COVID.
          
          
            Methods
            Prospective, longitudinal study conducted in COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR. Serial blood and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were obtained for measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG antibodies during hospital stay, and at 1, 2 and 6 months post-discharge. Genome sequencing was performed where appropriate. Patients filled out a COVID19-symptom-questionnaire (CSQ) at 2-month and 6-month visits, and those with highest scores were characterized.
          
          
            Results
            Of 146 patients (60\% male, median age 64 years) followed-up, 20.6\% required hospital readmission and 5.5\% died. At 2-months and 6-months, 9.6\% and 7.8\% patients, respectively, reported moderate/severe persistent symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in NPS in 11.8\% (median Ct=38) and 3\% (median Ct=36) patients at 2-months and 6-months, respectively, but no reinfections were demonstrated.
            Antibody titers gradually waned, with seroreversion occurring at 6 months in 27 (27.6\%) patients for N-IgG and in 6 (6\%) for S-IgG. Adjusted 2-month predictors of the highest CSQ scores (OR [95\%CI]) were lower peak S-IgG (0.80 [0.66-0.94]) and higher WHO-severity-score (2.57 [1.20-5.86]); 6-month predictors were lower peak S-IgG (0.89 [0.79-0.99]) and female sex (2.41 [1.20-4.82]); no association was found with prolonged viral shedding.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Late clinical events and persistent symptoms in the medium and long term occurred in a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Gender, severity of illness and weaker antibody responses, but not viral shedding, were associated with long-COVID.
          
          
            Summary
            This study characterizes the long-term clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes following COVID-19 hospitalization. We found a significant proportion of late clinical events and persistent symptoms. Gender, severity of illness and weaker antibody responses, but not viral shedding, predicted long-COVID.},

            Background
            COVID-19 pandemic has ignited the urge for repurposing old drugs as candidate antiviral medicines to treat novel challenges of viral infections. Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients.
          
          
            Methods
            Randomized controlled open label clinical trial encompassed 75 COVID-19 patients treated with standard of care plus NCS were included as experimental group and 75 COVID-19 patients treated with only standard of care therapy as control group. Each group was composed of 25 mild, 25 moderate and 25 severe patients. Survival rate, time to recovery, and side effects were the main endpoints for the assessment of the therapeutic effect and safety of NCS.
          
          
            Results
            NCS did not enhance survival rate as three of severe COVID-19 patients in NCS and in control groups died (P{\textgreater}0.05). However, NCS, compared to control group, reduced the time to recovery in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients about 5 and 3 days, respectively but not in mild patients (P≤0.05). Most interestingly, NCS lowered time to recovery up to five days in patients with co-morbidities (P≤0.05) whereas only one day lowered in patients without co-morbidities (P{\textgreater}0.05).
          
          
            Conclusion
            It is concluded that NCS accelerates time to recovery about 3 to 5 days in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients especially those with co-morbidities; hence, NCS is of clinical benefit for freeing hospital beds for more patients in pandemic crisis.},

            Background
            Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to guide quarantine and reduce transmission. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound (LUS), an affordable, consumable-free point-of-care tool, for COVID-19 screening.
          
          
            Methods
            
              This prospective observational cohort included adults presenting with cough and/or dyspnea at a SARS-CoV-2 screening center of Lausanne University Hospital between March 31
              st
              and May 8
              th
              , 2020. Investigators recorded standardized LUS images and videos in 10 lung zones per subject. Two blinded independent experts reviewed LUS recording and classified abnormal findings according to pre-specified criteria to investigate their predictive value to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection according to PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (COVID

              ). We finally combined LUS and clinical findings to derive a multivariate logistic regression diagnostic score.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              Of 134 included patients, 23\% (n=30/134) were COVID

Combining LUS findings in a multivariate logistic regression score had an area under the receiver-operating curve of 63.9\% to detect COVID-19, but improved to 84.5\% with the addition of clinical features
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            
              COVID

              patients are significantly more likely to have lung pathology by LUS. Our findings have potential diagnostic value for COVID-19 at the point of care. Combination of clinical and LUS features showed promising results, which need confirmation in a larger study population.
            
          
          
            What is already known on the subject
            
              
                Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is a consumable-free, easy-to-use, portable, non-radiating and non-invasive screening tool that can be performed at the bedside: its diagnostic performance for pneumonia has been established.
              
              
                Recent studies conducted in emergency department showed a correlation between LUS findings and COVID-19 diagnosis.
              
            
          
          
            What the study ads
            
              
                This is the first study assessing the diagnostic performance of LUS for COVID-19 in outpatients with mild acute respiratory tract infection.
              
              
                Mild COVID-19 patients are more likely to have lung pathology by LUS compared with COVID-19 negative.
              
              
                Combination of clinical and LUS features showed promising results with a potential diagnostic value for COVID-19 at the point of care.},

            Background
            Given the COVID-19 pandemic’s, researchers are beseeched for effective treatments. Herbal medicine is also queried for potential supplementary treatments for COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and Mastic herbal medications for COVID-19 patients.
          
          
            Methods
            This was a double-blinded randomized clinical trial study conducted over three months from May to July 2020 in patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Peymaniyeh Hospital in Jahrom, Iran. The intervention group received the treatment protocol approved by the Ministry of Health of Iran during the period of hospitalization and the herbal supplement obtained from the combination of black myrobalan and mastic and sugarcane, twice a day (3g of herbal supplements). All patients were compared in terms of demographic variables, vital signs, clinical and laboratory variables.
          
          
            Results
            72 patients with COVID-19, divided into intervention (n=37) and control (n=35) groups. intervention and control groups had not any significant difference in terms of baseline characteristics. The time-to-event analysis revealed a significant difference in 4 symptoms of cough, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia (P{\textless}0.05). The Control group had a significantly lower decrease in C-reactive protein during 7 days (P{\textless}0.05). Patients in the herbal supplement group were hospitalized for 4.12 days and in the control group were hospitalized for 8.37 days (P=0.001). ICU admission and death only happened in 3 (8.6\%) patients of the control group.
          
          
            Conclusion
            While advanced studies with more sample size are needed; the proposed combination seems to be effective in the symptom treatment and reducing the length of hospitalization.},

            Background
            Following a year of development, several vaccines have been approved to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic. Real world comparative data on immune response following vaccination or natural infection are rare.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a longitudinal observational study in employees at a secondary care hospital affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparisons were made about the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibody ratio after natural infection, or vaccination with one or two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2), or one dose of AstraZenca (Vaxzevria) vaccine.
          
          
            Results
            We found a 100\% humoral response rate in participants after 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. The antibody ratio in participants with one dose BNT162b2 and Vaxzevria did not differ significantly to those with previous PCR-confirmed infection, whereas this was significantly lower in comparison to two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer. We could not identify a correlation with previous comorbidities, obesity or age within this study. Smoking showed a negative effect on the antibody response (p=0.006)

            BACKGROUND
            Essential workers are at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We did a prospective study to estimate the yield, acceptability, and costs of workplace-based systematic SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic essential workers.
          
          
            METHODS
            We recruited non-healthcare essential businesses, in Montréal, Canada. Mobile teams, composed of two non-healthcare professionals each, visited businesses. Consenting, asymptomatic employees provided saline gargle specimens under supervision. Mobile team members self-sampled weekly. Specimens were analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If an outbreak was detected (≥2 positives), we retested all initially negative participants. We did logistic regression for factors associated with a positive test. We estimated costs (\$CAD) of this strategy.
          
          
            RESULTS
            From 27 January to 12 March 2021, 69 essential businesses were visited. Of an estimated 2348 employees onsite, 2128 (90.6\%) participated. Across 2626 tests, 53 (2.0\%) were positive. Self-reported non-Caucasian ethnicity (aOR 3.7, 95\% CI: 1.4-9.9) and a negative SARS-CoV-2 test before the study (0.4, 0.2-0.8) were positively and negatively associated with a positive test, respectively. Five businesses—3 manufacturing/supplier and 2 meat processing— were experiencing an outbreak. At these businesses, 40 (4.4\%) of 917 participants were positive on the initial test. We repeated testing at three of these businesses over 2-3 weeks: 8/350 (2.3\%) were positive on the second test, and zero were positive on the third and fourth test (148 tests); no employer reported new positives to 26 March 2021. In all other businesses, 1211 participants were tested once—5 (0.4\%) were positive at three childcare enterprises, one grocery store, and one manufacturing/supplier. Per person, RT-PCR costs were \$34.00 and all other costs \$8.67. No mobile team member tested positive.
          
          
            INTERPRETATION
            Onsite sampling of essential workers with saline gargle is safe, acceptable, and inexpensive. Repeat testing appeared to eliminate outbreaks. Systematic testing should be considered part of SARS-CoV-2 preventive efforts.},

          The present longitudinal study aims to investigate the risk factors for getting COVID-19 in a population aged 50 to 74 years. Data were collected from Shahroud Eye Cohort Study and the electronic system of COVID-19 in Shahroud, northeast Iran. Participants were followed for about 13 months and predisposing factors for COVID-19 infection were investigated using log binomial model and by calculation of relative risks. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shahroud (February 20, 2020) to March 26, 2021, out of 4394 participants in the Eye Cohort Study, 271 (6.1\%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test on two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Risk factors for getting COVID-19 were included male gender (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.51; 95\% Confidence Intervals (CI), 1.15-1.99), BMI over 25 (RR = 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.05) and diabetes (RR = 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.67). Also, smoking (RR = 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.93) and education (RR = 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.92-0.98) had reverse associations. In conclusion men and diabetic patients and those who have BMI over 25, should be more alert to follow the health protocols related to COVID-19 and priority should be given to them considering COVID-19 vaccination.},

            Introduction
            Assessing the risk factors for and consequences of infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is essential to guide clinical guidelines and care. Previous studies on the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalised patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission.
          
          
            Material and Methods
            This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to secure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to COVID-19.
          
          
            Results
            Among 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5\%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (OR 2.19 [1.41–3.41]) and being foreign born (OR 2.12 [1.70–2.64]). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74 [1.00–7.51]), smoking (OR 4.69 [1.58–13.90]), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22–27 weeks: OR 3.77 [1.16–12.29]; GA 28–36 weeks: OR 4.76 [1.60–14.12]) and having asthma (OR 4.53 [1.39–14.79]). We found no difference in any obstetric or neonatal outcomes.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Only 1 in 20 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy require admission to hospital due to COVID-19. And severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are rare.
          
          
            Key Message
            Population based cohort study about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Asthma and foreign ethnicity were identified as risk factors for infection while obstetric outcomes did not change. Obesity, smoking, infection after GA 22, and asthma increased the risk of hospital admission.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            International guidelines for testing potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients receiving non-surgical anticancer therapies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are currently lacking. The value of routinely testing staff treating cancer patients is not known.
          
          
            Methods
            Patient-facing oncology department staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic consented to have a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using a laboratory Luminex-based assay and a rapid point-of-care (POC) assay on 2 occasions 28 days apart in June and July 2020.
          
          
            Findings
            
              434 participants were recruited: nurses (58·3\%), doctors (21·2\%), radiographers (10·4\%) and administrators (10·1\%). 82\% were female; median age 40-years (range 19-66). 26·3\% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1·4\% tested PCR-positive prior to June 2020. All were PCR-negative at both study day 1 and 28. 18·4\% were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive on day 1 by Luminex, of whom 42·5\% also tested positive by POC. 47·5\% of Luminex sero-positives had antibodies to both nucleocapsid (N) and surface (S) antigens. Nurses (21·3\%) and doctors (17·4\%) had higher prevalence trends of Luminex sero-positivity compared with administrators (13·6\%) and radiographers (8·9\%) (
              p
              =0.2). 38\% of sero-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 1·9-fold higher odds than sero-negative participants (
              p
              =0·01). 400 participants re-tested on day 28: 13·3\% were Luminex sero-positive of whom 92·5\% were previously positive and 7·5\% newly positive. Nurses (16·5\%) had the highest seroprevalence trend amongst staff groups (
              p
              =0·07). 32·5\% of day 1 sero-positives became sero-negative by day 28: the majority being previously reactive to the N-antigen only (
              p
              {\textless}0·0001).
            
          
          
            Interpretation
            The high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG sero-positivity in oncology nurses, and the high decline of positivity over 4 weeks supports regular antigen and antibody testing in this staff group for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine patient care prior to availability of a vaccine.

            Evidence before this study
            To identify studies involving oncology healthcare workers and SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, we searched PubMed and Medrxiv for articles published between January 1 and July 31 using the following search terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “oncology staff”, “healthcare workers” without language restriction. To date, no large study has specifically reported and tracked patient-facing oncology staff SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
          
          
            Added value of this study
            To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study specifically investigating SARS-CoV-2 exposure in UK patient-facing oncology staff who were at work during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and June 2020. 18·4\% of staff were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of June 2020 suggesting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 32·5\% of those antibody-positive cases became antibody-negative 28 days after the first sample collection. The highest seroprevalence rates at both time points were recorded in nurses.
          
          
            Implications of all the available evidence
            These results justify incorporating SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing of oncology nurses into international guidelines for managing cancer patients treated with non-surgical anticancer treatments prior to availability of a functional vaccine.},

            Objective
            Prospectively validate two prognostic scores, pre-hospitalisation (SOARS) and hospitalised mortality prediction (4C Mortality Score), derived from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first wave, in the evolving second wave with prevalent B.1.1.7 and parent D614 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, in two large United Kingdom (UK) cohorts.
          
          
            Design
            Prospective observational cohort study of SOARS and 4C Mortality Score in PREDICT (single site) and multi-site ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium) cohorts.
          
          
            Setting
            Protocol-based data collection in UK COVID-19 second wave, between October 2020 and January 2021, from PREDICT and ISARIC cohorts.
          
          
            Participants
            1383 from single site PREDICT cohort and 20,595 from multi-site ISARIC cohort.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            Relevance of SOARS and 4C Mortality Score derived from the COVID-19 first wave, determining in-hospital mortality and safe discharge in the UK COVID-19 second wave.
          
          
            Results
            Data from 1383 patients (median age 67y, IQR 52-82; mortality 24.7\%) in the PREDICT and 20,595 patients from the ISARIC (mortality 19.4\%) cohorts showed both SOARS and 4C Mortality Score remained relevant despite the B.1.1.7 variant and treatment advances. SOARS had AUC of 0.8 and 0.74, while 4C Mortality Score had an AUC of 0.83 and 0.91 for hospital mortality, in the PREDICT and ISARIC cohorts respectively, therefore effective in evaluating both safe discharge and in-hospital mortality. 19.3\% (231/1195, PREDICT cohort) and 16.7\% (2550/14992, ISARIC cohort) with a SOARS of 0-1 were potential candidates for home discharge to a virtual hospital (VH) model. SOARS score implementation resulted in low re-admission rates, 11.8\% (27/229), and low mortality, 0.9\% (2/229), in the VH pathway. Use is still suboptimal to prevent admission, as 8.1\% in the PREDICT cohort and 9.5\% in the ISARIC cohort were admitted despite SOARS score of 0-1.
          
          
            Conclusion
            SOARS and 4C Mortality Score remains valid, providing accurate prognostication despite evolving viral subtype and treatment advances, which have altered mortality. Both scores are easily implemented within urgent care pathways with a scope for admission avoidance. They remain safe and relevant to their purpose, transforming complex clinical presentations into tangible numbers, aiding objective decision making.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Evidence to date indicates that mortality of acute coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is higher in men than in women. Conversely, women seem more likely to suffer from long-term consequences of the disease and pronounced negative social and economic impacts. Sex- and gender specific risk factors of COVID-19-related long-term effects are unknown.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of 5838 (44.6\% women) individuals in Switzerland who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA between February and December 2020. Of all surviving individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 2799 (1285 [45.9\%] women) completed a follow-up questionnaire.
          
          
            Findings
            After a mean follow-up time of 197±77 days, women more often reported at least one persistent symptom (43.0\% vs 31.5\%, p{\textless}0.001) with reduced exercise tolerance and reduced resilience being the most frequently reported symptom in both sexes. Critical illness (intermediate or intensive care unit admission) during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio[95\%CI]: 4.00[2.66-6.02], p{\textless}0.0001 was a risk factor of post-COVID syndrome in both women and men. Women with pre-existing mental illness (1.81[1.00-3.26], p=0.049), cardiovascular risk factors (1.39[1.03-1.89], p=0.033), higher self-reported domestic stress levels (1.15[1.08-1.22], p{\textless}0.0001), and feminine gender identity (1.12[1.02-1.24], p=0.02) increased the odds of experiencing post-COVID syndrome. Conversely, obesity (1.44[1.03-2.02], p=0.034) increased the odds of post-COVID syndrome in men, but not in women. Being responsible for household work (men, OR 0.82[0.69-0.97], p=0.021), taking care of children/relatives (women, 0.90[0.84-0.96], p=0.002) or being pregnant at the time of acute COVID-19 illness (OR 0.48[0.23-1.01], p=0.054) was associated with lower odds of post-COVID syndrome.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Predictors of post-COVID syndrome differ between men and women. Our data reinforce the importance to include sex and gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID syndrome so that access to care and early intervention can be tailored to their different needs.
          
          
            Research in context
            
              Evidence before this study
              
                We performed a PubMed search for studies investigating short- and long-term health sequelae in COVID-19 survivors. We included all studies published prior to May 30
                th
                , 2021. The search comprised the following terms: (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR 2019-nCoV) AND (post COVID OR long COVID OR survivor OR recover OR persistent OR follow up OR discharge OR long-term OR sequelae). Previous studies have reported a variety of symptoms in COVID-19 survivors from different countries such as China (Wuhan), the UK, and the U.S. Overall, these studies showed that a substantial burden of health issues spanning multiple organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. The most frequent symptoms reported after acute infection were fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep disturbances, headache, dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, and anosmia. Two studies indicate that women are overrepresented amongst post-COVID-19 syndrome patients suffering from fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, or anosmia. However, the representativeness of the studies and the explicitness of provided information were insufficient due to lacking variables and/or small numbers of cases and the short duration of follow-up. Sex-and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome are currently unknown.
              
            
            
              Added value of this study
              In a large cohort study (n=2799) with long follow-up (mean follow-up 197±77 days), we investigated sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 health sequalae. Our data allow for identification of sex- and gender-specific predictors of post-COVID-19 syndrome. In a multivariable association model, post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with severity of illness and number of symptoms during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in both sexes, while pre-existing mental illness and cardiovascular risk factors were significant predictors only in women. Conversely, obesity was independently associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome in men, but not in women. Gender-related risk factors of post-COVID syndrome were feminine traits and higher amount of domestic stress, both increasing the odds of post-COVID-19 syndrome in women, while pregnancy during acute COVID-19 illness and responsibility for childcare protected women, and responsibility for household work protected men from experiencing post-COVID-19 syndrome.
            
            
              Implications of all the available evidence
              Evidence indicates that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women. We provide evidence that female sex and gender is associated with long-term sequalae of COVID-19. Our data reinforce the importance of including gender to identify patients at risk for post-COVID-19 syndrome so that the functional return of both male and female COVID-19 survivors can be maximized.},

            Introduction
            Since the worldwide emergence of the COVID-19, several protocols were used by different healthcare organisations. We evaluated in this study the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 disease in Egyptian population with special consideration for its mortality predictors.
          
          
            Methodology
            8162 participants (mean age 48.7±17.3 years,54.5\% males) with RT-PCR positive COVID-19 were included. The electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate.
          
          
            Results
            The in-hospital mortality was 11.2\%. There was a statistically significant strong association of in-hospital mortality with age {\textgreater}60 years old (OR:4.7; 95\% CI 4.1-5.4;p{\textless}0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR:4.6; 95\% CI 3.99-5.32;p{\textless}0.001), hypertension (OR:3.9; 95\% CI 3.4-4.5;p{\textless}0.001), coronary artery disease (OR:2.7; 95\% CI 2.2-3.2;p{\textless}0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR:2.1; 95\% CI 1.7-2.5;p{\textless}0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR:4.8; 95\% CI 3.9-5.9;p{\textless}0.001), malignancy (OR:3.7; 95\% CI 2.3-5.75;p{\textless}0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio {\textgreater}3.1 (OR:6.4; 95\% CI 4.4-9.5;P{\textless} 0.001), and ground glass opacities (GGOs) in CT chest (OR:3.5; 95\% CI 2.84-4.4;P{\textless}0.001), respectively. There was a statistically significant moderate association of in-hospital mortality with male gender (OR:1.6; 95\% CI 1.38-1.83;p{\textless}0.001) and smoking (OR:1.6; 95\% CI 1.3-1.9;p{\textless}0.001). GGOs was reported as the most common CT finding (occurred in 73.1\% of the study participants).
          
          
            Conclusions
            This multicenter, retrospective study ascertained the higher in-hospital mortality rate in Egyptian COVID-19 patients with different comorbidities.},

            Background
            There is an urgent need to assess the role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada to inform public health measures. We describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in students and staff in the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) region in the first three months of the 2020/2021 academic year, and examine the extent of transmission in schools.
          
          
            Methods
            This descriptive epidemiologic study using contact tracing data included all SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to VCH between September 10 and December 18, 2020 who worked in or attended K-12 schools in-person. Case and cluster characteristics were described.
          
          
            Results
            There were 699 school staff and student cases during the study period, for an incidence of 55 cases per 10,000 population, compared to 73 per 10,000 population in all VCH residents. Among VCH resident staff and student cases, 53\% were linked to a household case/cluster, {\textless}1.5\% were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Out of 699 cases present at school, 26 clusters with school-based transmission resulted in 55 secondary cases. Staff members accounted for 54\% of index cases (14/26) while comprising 14\% of the school population. Among clusters, 88\% had fewer than 4 secondary cases.
          
          
            Interpretation
            COVID-19 incidence in the school population was lower than that of the general population. There were no deaths and severe disease was rare. School-based transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 were uncommon and clusters were small. Our results support the growing body of evidence that schools do not play a major role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.},

            Objective
            We aimed to determine the prevalence of the severity of COVID-19 illness and its associated predisposing factors in Nepal.
          
          
            Design
            Cross-sectional, observational study
          
          
            Setting
            Single-centered hospital-based study, conducted at Nepal armed police force (APF) hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.
          
          
            Participants
            All individuals aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 (the SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time-RT-PCR result positive), regardless the severity of their disease.
          
          
            Measurements
            Disease severity was evaluated as a primary outcome and age, sex, BMI, smoking history, alcohol history, Hypertension, diabetes mellitus were evaluated as predictors in the analysis.
          
          
            Results
            Mean ages of the patients were 40.79±16.04 years, and about two-thirds of the patients were male 146 (73.7\%). More than half 57.1\% (95\%CI: 52.42-61.51) of the population had a mild infection, whereas 16.7\% (95\%CI: 7.4-24.6\%) had severe/critical illness. In univariate analysis, each 1-year increase in age (OR: 1.05; 95\% CI:1.030-1.081; P{\textless}0.001), each 1 unit increase in BMI (OR:1.12; 95\% CI:1.02-1.25; P=0.033), comorbid illness (OR: 5.79; 95\%CI: 2.51-13.33; P{\textless}0.001), hypertension (OR:5.95; 95\%CI:2.66-13.30: P{\textless}0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR:3.26; 95\%CI:1.30-8.15: P{\textless}0.005), and fever (OR:34.64; 95\% CI:7.98-150.38; P{\textless}0.001) were independently associated with severity of the disease, whereas age (OR: 1.049; 95\% CI: 1.019-1.080; P=0.02), hypertension (OR: 4.77; 95\%CI: 1.62-14.04; P=0.004), and fever (OR: 51.02; 95\%CI: 9.56-272.51; P{\textless}0.001) remained a significant predictive factors in multivariate analysis.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The majority of the patients with COVID-19 had a mild illness, with 16.7\% severe illness. Age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, comorbidity, and temperature were associated the severity of the illness. Age, hypertension, and fever emerged as an independent predictive factors in multivariate analysis, and thus, these vulnerable groups should be given special protection to the infection and proactive intervention should be initiated at an early stage of the infection to diminish the severity of the illness and improve the clinical outcome of the disease.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of the study
            
              
                Much of the studies on COVID-19 in Nepal focus on the describing epidemiology and clinical profile of the disease, however, risk factors that contribute to the severity of the illness are overlooked.
              
              
                This study may help estimate the burden of the disease and identify the vulnerable group with poor prognosis, which is vital for clinicians and the public health approach to deal with the disease.
              
              
                Although limiting the study to a single-center with a relatively small sample size, it, however, allows evaluation of the importance of the demographic and geographical variation.
              
              
                Socio-economic factors, lifestyle, and availability of quality medical care may have contributed to the severity of the COVID-19, which needs to be addressed in a further large-scale study.},

            BACKGROUND
            The effectiveness of rosuvastatin plus colchicine, emtricitabine/tenofovir, and of their combined use in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is unclear.
          
          
            METHODS
            In each hospital, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia, were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive: a) standard of care; or b) emtricitabine/tenofovir; or c) colchicine + rosuvastatin; or d) emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within the first 28 days after randomization. Severe adverse events (SAE) were those with a high probability of being treatment-related.
          
          
            RESULTS
            633 patients were randomized in 6 hospitals in Bogota, Colombia. Overall, 98\% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death through day 28 was 10.7\% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 14.4\% in the colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 13.8\% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir arm, and 17.4\% in the standard of care arm, with adjusted risk differences (aRD) against the standard treatment of -0.07 (95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.17 to 0.04), aRD -0.03 (95\%CI: -0.11 to 0.05) and aRD: -0.05 (95\%CI: -0.15 to 0.05), respectively. Need for invasive mechanical ventilation was lower in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm compared to the standard treatment arm, aRD: -0.06 (95\%CI: -0.11 to -0,01), but no differences were found between the other comparisons. SAE occurred in 3 patients distributed in the 3 treatment arms.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Among patients hospitalized with moderate and severe SARS Covid-19, the use of the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin combination emerges as a treatment alternative.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Objectives
            To determine if changes in public behaviours, developments in COVID-19 treatments, improved patient care, and directed policy initiatives have altered outcomes for minority ethnic groups in the second pandemic wave.
          
          
            Design
            Prospectively defined observational study using registry data.
          
          
            Setting
            Four acute NHS Hospitals in east London.

              February 2021.
            
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            Primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of index COVID-19 hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were 90-day mortality and need for ICU admission. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnicity and mortality accounting for predefined risk factors. Age-standardised rates of hospital admission relative to the local population were compared between ethnic groups.
          
          
            Results
            Of 5533 patients, the ethnic distribution was White (n=1805, 32.6\%), Asian/Asian British (n=1983, 35.8\%), Black/Black British (n=634, 11.4\%), Mixed/Other (n=433, 7.8\%), and unknown (n=678, 12.2\%). Excluding 678 patients with missing data, 4855 were included in multivariable analysis. Relative to the White population, Asian and Black populations experienced 4.1 times (3.77-4.39) and 2.1 times (1.88-2.33) higher rates of age-standardised hospital admission. After adjustment for various patient risk factors including age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation, Asian patients were at significantly higher risk of death within 30 days (HR 1.47 [1.24-1.73]). No association with increased risk of death in hospitalised patients was observed for Black or Mixed/Other ethnicity.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Asian and Black ethnic groups continue to experience poor outcomes following COVID-19. Despite higher-than-expected rates of admission, Black and Asian patients experienced similar or greater risk of death in hospital, implying a higher overall risk of COVID-19 associated death in these communities.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of this study
            
              
                This study represents one of the largest descriptors of outcomes in minority ethnic patients with COVID-19 distinguished by the majority ethnically diverse cohort within a catchment area of approximately one million people in the east of London.
              
              
                Large absolute numbers of patients drawn from a single geographic region and treated within the same hospital system minimize many of the geographic biases present within other studies including the impact of variation in transmission risk.
              
              
                Our analyses are strengthened by adherence to a prespecified analysis plan, inclusion of a detailed baseline, comorbidity, and COVID-19 risk factors in multivariable modelling, and sensitivity tests using different measures of comorbidity.
              
              
                However as with all observational studies, not all potential contributing risk factors could be assessed, including other measures of baseline health status such as nutritional or lifestyle influences as well as contextual factors such as household composition and occupation.
              
              
                We were not able to include suspected but not proven COVID-19 cases or community cases not requiring hospital admission or the effect of the differing viral strains in the first and second wave.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has caused high inpatient mortality and morbidity throughout the world. COVID19 convalescent plasma has been utilized as a potential therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID19 pneumonia. This study evaluated the outcomes of hospitalized COVID19 patients treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma in a prospective, observational multicenter trial.
          
          
            Methods
            From April 2020 through August 2020, hospitalized COVID19 patients at 16 participating hospitals in Colorado were enrolled and treated with COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) and compared to hospitalized patients with COVID19 who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Plasma antibody levels were determined following the trial given that antibody tests were not approved at the initiation of the trial. CCP-treated and untreated COVID19 hospitalized patients were matched using propensity scores followed by analysis for length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
          
          
            Results
            542 total hospitalized COVID19 patients were enrolled at 16 hospitals across the region. A total of 468 hospitalized COVID19 patients were entered into propensity score matching with 188 patients matched for analysis in the CCP-treatment and control arms. Fine-Gray models revealed increased length of hospital stay in CCP-treated patients and no change in inpatient mortality compared to controls. In subgroup analysis of CCP-treated patients within 7 days of admission, there was no difference in length of hospitalization and inpatient mortality.
          
          
            Conclusions
            These data show that treatment of hospitalized COVID19 patients with CCP did not significantly improve patient hospitalization length of stay or inpatient mortality.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant properties, has anti-inflammatory and potential anti-viral effects, and may improve endothelial function in patients with Covid-19. Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process, and reduce the risk of critical illness or death.
          
          
            Methods
            We randomly assigned moderately ill hospitalized ward patients admitted for Covid-19 with elevated D-dimer level to therapeutic or prophylactic heparin. The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.
          
          
            Results
            At 28 days, the primary composite outcome occurred in 37 of 228 patients (16.2\%) assigned to therapeutic heparin, and 52 of 237 patients (21.9\%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.10; p=0.12). Four patients (1.8\%) assigned to therapeutic heparin died compared with 18 patients (7.6\%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.22; 95\%-CI, 0.07 to 0.65). The composite of all-cause mortality or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 (10.1\%) in the therapeutic heparin group and 38 (16.0\%) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio, 0.59; 95\%-CI, 0.34 to 1.02). Major bleeding occurred in 2 patients (0.9\%) with therapeutic heparin and 4 patients (1.7\%) with prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.52; 95\%-CI, 0.09 to 2.85).
          
          
            Conclusions
            In moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 and elevated D-dimer level, therapeutic heparin did not significantly reduce the primary outcome but decreased the odds of death at 28 days.

            Background
            Whether HIV infection is associated with differences in clinical outcomes among people hospitalized with COVID-19 is uncertain.
          
          
            Objective
            To evaluate the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized patients.
          
          
            Methods
            Using the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease registry, we used hierarchical mixed effects models to assess the association of HIV with in-hospital mortality accounting for patient demographics and comorbidities and clustering by hospital. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACE), severity of illness, and length of stay (LOS).
          
          
            Results
            The registry included 21,528 hospitalization records of people with confirmed COVID-19 from 107 hospitals in 2020, including 220 people living with HIV (PLWH). PLWH were younger (56.0+/-13.0 versus 61.3+/-17.9 years old) and more likely to be male (72.3\% vs 52.7\%), Non-Hispanic Black (51.4\% vs 25.4\%), on Medicaid (44.5\% vs 24.5), and active tobacco users (12.7\% versus 6.5\%).
            Of the study population, 36 PLWH (16.4\%) had in-hospital mortality compared with 3,290 (15.4\%) without HIV (Risk ratio 1.06, 95\%CI 0.79-1.43; risk difference 0.9\%, 95\%CI −4.2 to 6.1\%; p=0.71). After adjustment for age, sex, race, and insurance, HIV was not associated with in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.13; 95\%CI 0.77-1.6; p 0.54) even after adding body mass index and comorbidities (aOR 1.15; 95\%CI 0.78-1.70; p=0.48). HIV was not associated with MACE (aOR 0.99, 95\%CI 0.69-1.44, p=0.91), severity of illness (aOR 0.96, 95\%CI 0.62-1.50, p=0.86), or LOS (aOR 1.03; 95\% CI 0.76-1.66, p=0.21).
          
          
            Conclusion
            HIV was not associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 including in-hospital mortality, MACE, or severity of illness.
          
          
            Condensed Abstract
            We studied 21,528 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 107 hospitals in AHA’s COVID-19 registry to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes. More patients with HIV were younger, male, non-Hispanic Black, on Medicaid and current smokers. HIV was not associated with worse COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (Risk ratio 1.06, 95\%CI 0.79-1.43; p=0.71) even after adjustment (aOR 1.15; 95\%CI 0.78-1.70; p=0.48). HIV was also not associated with MACE (aOR 0.99, 95\%CI 0.69-1.44, p=0.91) or severity of illness (aOR 0.96, 95\%CI 0.62-1.50, p=0.86. Our findings do not support that HIV is a major risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.},

          Infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to the economic burden it has put on the country. While waiting for a vaccine that gives adequate protection, it is necessary to understand the course of the infection and identify drugs that could reduce its impact. The results of this multicenter study involving 1035 hospitalized patients in Pune, identified diabetes, hypertension and low lymphocyte counts as predictors of mortality. There is also an indication that multiple comorbidities add to risk of severe disease and mortality. Data from metformin treated diabetics raises the possibility of considering repurposing of this drug in a larger study. It is also noted that Hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, azithromycin and remdesivir were associated with lower overall mortality. Diabetes and hypertension put Covid infected patients at greater risk of death, coexistence of both diseases further augment the risk, and must be aggressively treated.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the catastrophic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. This study aimed to provide epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and to determine whether characteristic profiles differ between patients who are symptomatic vs. asymptomatic for the disease. The first 492 consecutive patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia between March and September 2020 were included in this study. An electronic case report form developed using REDCap was used to collect data for each patient, including demographic characteristics, virus exposure (travel history, and human and animal contact), vaccination history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiographic reports, cardiac workup, medications, treatment regimens, and patient outcome. This patient cohort was 54\% male, with 20.4\% aged more than 60 years, 19.9\% aged 31 to 40 years, and 17\% aged 41 to 50 years. Most patients (79.2\%) were symptomatic. Variables that significantly differed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were age, blood oxygen saturation percentage, hemoglobin level, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte (NTL) ratio, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level. Asymptomatic patients were mostly younger, with lower body mass index and ALT and AST levels but higher lymphocyte counts, NTL ratio, and CD4, CD8, natural killer cell, IgG, and IgM levels. The median incubation period reported for this cohort was 16 day, with upper and lower 95\% quartiles of 27 and 10 days, respectively. Factors associated with increased risk of mortality were age (older than 42 years) and comorbidities, including specifically diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Patients who were not given an antiviral regimen were associated with better prognosis than patients who received an antiviral regimen (HR, 0.07; 95\% CI, 0.011-0.25). Similar to countries worldwide, Saudi Arabia has explored treatment options to save the lives of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analyses will inform clinicians as well as policy makers to adopt the best strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection management and treatment options.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Efforts to stem Canada’s SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can benefit from direct understanding of the prevalence, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and information on asymptomatic infection.
          
          
            Methods
            We surveyed a representative sample of 19,994 adult Canadians about COVID symptoms and analyzed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from self-collected dried blood spots (DBS) in 8,967 adults. A sensitive and specific chemiluminescence ELISA detected IgG to the spike trimer. We compared seroprevalence to deaths to establish IFRs and used mortality data to estimate infection levels in nursing home residents.
          
          
            Results
            The best estimate (high specificity) of adult seroprevalence nationally is 1.7\%, but as high as 3.5\% (high sensitivity) depending on assay cut-offs. The highest prevalence was in Ontario (2.4-3.9\%) and in younger adults aged 18-39 years (2.5-4.4\%). Based on mortality, we estimated 13-17\% of nursing home residents became infected. The first viral wave infected 0.54-1.08 million adult Canadians, half of whom were {\textless}40 years old. The IFR outside nursing homes was 0.20-0.40\%, but the COVID mortality rate in nursing home residents was {\textgreater}70 times higher than that in comparably-aged adults living in the community. Seropositivity correlated with COVID symptoms, particularly during March. Asymptomatic adults constituted about a quarter of definite seropositives, with a greater proportion in the elderly.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Canada had relatively low infection prevalence and low IFRs in the community, but not in nursing homes, during the first viral wave. Self-collected DBS for antibody testing is a practicable strategy to monitor the ongoing second viral wave and, eventually, vaccine-induced immunity among Canadian adults.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            BACKGROUND
            Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients.
          
          
            METHODS
            We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors.
          
          
            RESULTS
            OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95\% CI 2.76 - 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.},

          COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe healthcare challenge calling for an integrated approach in determining the clues for early non-invasive diagnostics of the potentially severe cases and efficient patient stratification.
          Here we analyze the clinical, laboratory and CT scan characteristics associated with high risk of COVID-19-related death outcome in the cohort of severely-ill patients in Russia. The data obtained reveal that elevated dead lymphocyte counts, decreased early apoptotic lymphocytes, decreased CD14+/HLA-Dr+ monocytes, increased expression of JNK in PBMCs, elevated IL-17 and decreased PAI-1 serum levels are associated with a high risk of COVID-19-related mortality thus suggesting them to be new prognostic factors. This set of determinants could be used as early predictors of potentially severe course of COVID-19 for trials of prevention or timely treatment.

            SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates a wide range of severity, the more severe cases demonstrate a cytokine storm with elevated serum interleukin-6, hence IL-6 receptor antibody Tocilizumab was tried for the management of severe cases.
          
          
            Objectives
            The effect of Tocilizumab treatment on the composite outcome of ventilator free days, among critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients.
          
          
            Method
            Retrospective observational propensity score matching study, comparing mechanically ventilated patients upon ICU admission who received Tocilizumab to a control group. Utilizing competing risk analysis method, and reporting sub-distributional hazard ratio of a composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28.
          
          
            Results
            29 patients in the intervention group were compared to 29 patients in the control group. Matched groups were similar at base line. The primary outcome of ventilator free days was higher in the intervention group (SHR 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.2 – 6.3; p = 0.02), crude ICU mortality rate was not different between Tocilizumab and control groups (37.9\% versus 62\% respectively, p = 0.1), actual ventilator free days were significantly longer in Tocilizumab group (mean difference 4.7 days, 95\% CI 1.1 – 8.3; p = 0.02). Sensitivity analysis by Cox regression showed a significantly lower hazard ratio of death in Tocilizumab group (HR 0.49, 95\% CI: 0.25 – 0.97; p = 0.04). While there was no difference in grown positive cultures among groups (55.2\% in Tocilizumab group versus 34.5\% in the control, 95\% CI of difference: −7.11\% to 54.4\%; p = 0.1).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Tocilizumab may improve the composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28 among mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients, it is associated with significantly longer actual ventilator free days, and insignificantly lower mortality and superinfection.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            SARS-CoV-2 infections may be underestimated due to limited testing access, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa experienced two SARS-CoV-2 waves, the second associated with emergence of variant 501Y.V2. In this study, we report longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in cohorts in two communities in South Africa.
          
          
            Methods
            We measured SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence two monthly in randomly selected household cohorts in a rural and an urban community (July 2020-March 2021). We compared seroprevalence to laboratory-confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths reported in the districts to calculate infection-case (ICR), infection-hospitalisation (IHR) and infection-fatality ratio (IFR) in the two waves of infection.
          
          
            Findings
            Seroprevalence after the second wave ranged from 18\% (95\%CrI 10-26\%) and 28\% (95\%CrI 17-41\%) in children {\textless}5 years to 37\% (95\%CrI 28-47\%) in adults aged 19-34 years and 59\% (95\%CrI 49-68\%) in adults aged 35-59 years in the rural and urban community respectively. Individuals infected in the second wave were more likely to be from the rural site (aOR 4.7, 95\%CI 2.9-7.6), and 5-12 years (aOR 2.1, 95\%CI 1.1-4.2) or ≥60 years (aOR 2.8, 95\%CI 1.1-7.0), compared to 35-59 years. The in-hospital IFR in the urban site was significantly increased in the second wave 0.36\% (95\%CI 0.28-0.57\%) compared to the first wave 0.17\% (95\%CI 0.15-0.20\%). ICR ranged from 3.69\% (95\%CI 2.59-6.40\%) in second wave at urban community, to 5.55\% (95\%CI 3.40-11.23\%) in first wave in rural community.
          
          
            Interpretation
            The second wave was associated with a shift in age distribution of cases from individuals aged to 35-59 to individuals at the extremes of age, higher attack rates in the rural community and a higher IFR in the urban community. Approximately 95\% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in these two communities were not reported to the national surveillance system, which has implications for contact tracing and infection containment.

              Evidence before this study
              Seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of SARS-CoV-2 burden than laboratory-confirmed cases because many infections may be missed due to restricted access to care and testing, or differences in disease severity and health-care seeking behaviour. This underestimation may be amplified in African countries, where testing access may be limited. Seroprevalence data from sub-Saharan Africa are limited, and comparing seroprevalence estimates between countries can be challenging because populations studied and timing of the study relative to country-specific epidemics differs. During the first wave of infections in each country, seroprevalence was estimated at 4\% in Kenya and 11\% in Zambia. Seroprevalence estimates in South African blood donors is estimated to range between 32\% to 63\%. South Africa has experienced two waves of infection, with the emergence of the B.1.351/501Y.V2 variant of concern after the first wave. Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases may not be a true reflection of SARS-CoV-2 burden and specifically the differential impact of the first and second waves of infection.
            
            
              Added value of this study
              We collected longitudinal blood samples from prospectively followed rural and urban communities, randomly selected, household cohorts in South Africa between July 2020 and March 2021. From 668 and 598 individuals included from the rural and urban communities, respectively, seroprevalence was found to be 7\% (95\%CrI 5-9\%) and 27\% (95\%CrI 23-31\%), after the first wave of infection, and 26\% (95\%CrI 22-29\%) and 41\% (95\%CrI 37-45\%) after the second wave, in rural and urban study districts, respectively. After standardising for age, we estimated that only 5\% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were laboratory-confirmed and reported. Infection-hospitalisation ratios in the urban community were higher in the first (2.01\%, 95\%CI 1.57-2.57\%) and second (2.29\%, 95\%CI 1.63-3.94\%) wave than the rural community where there was a 0.75\% (95\%CI 0.49-1.41\%) and 0.66\% (95\%CI 0.50-0.98\%) infection-hospitalisation ratio in the first and second wave, respectively.
              When comparing the infection fatality ratios for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 waves, at the urban site, the ratios for both in-hospital and excess deaths to cases were significantly higher in the second wave (0.36\%, 95\%CI 0.28-0.57\% in-hospital and 0.51\%, 95\%CI 0.34-0.93\% excess deaths), compared to the first wave in-hospital (0.17\%, 95\%CI 0.15-0.20\%) and excess (0.13\%, 95\%CI 0.10-0.17\%) fatality ratios, p{\textless}0.001 and p{\textless}0.001, respectively). In the rural community, the point estimates for infection-fatality ratios also increased in the second wave compared to the first wave for in-hospital deaths, 0.13\% (95\%CI 0.10-0.23\%) first wave vs 0.20\% (95\%CI 0.13\%-0.28\%) second wave, and excess deaths (0.51\%, 95\%CI 0.30-1.06\% vs 0.70\%, 95\%CI 0.49-1.12\%), although neither change was statistically significant.
            
            
              Implications of all the available evidence
              In South Africa, the overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is substantially underestimated, resulting in many cases being undiagnosed and without the necessary public health action to isolate and trace contacts to prevent further transmission. There were more infections during the first wave in the urban community, and the second wave in the rural community. Although there were less infections during the second wave in the urban community, the infection-fatality ratios were significantly higher compared to the first wave. The lower infection-hospitalisation ratio and higher excess infection-fatality ratio in the rural community likely reflect differences in access to care or prevalence of risk factors for progression to severe disease in these two communities. In-hospital infection-fatality ratios for both communities during the first wave were comparable with what was experienced during the first wave in India (0.15\%) for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed deaths. To our knowledge, these are the first longitudinal seroprevalence data from a sub-Saharan Africa cohort, and provide a more accurate understanding of the pandemic, allowing for serial comparisons of antibody responses in relation to reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections within diverse communities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Some patients experience long-term symptoms after COVID-19, but data on outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 are scarce.
          
          
            Objective
            To describe persisting symptoms more than 3 months after infection in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in comparison to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR outpatients and to identify predictors of long-term symptoms in COVID-19.
          
          
            Setting
            Outpatient clinics of a Swiss university center.
          
          
            Patients
            418 symptomatic outpatients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-positive) and 89 negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR (COVID-negative).
          
          
            Design
            Prospective cohort study.
          
          
            Measurements
            Predefined long-term symptoms were evaluated though a phone interview {\textgreater}3 to 10 months after diagnosis.
            Associations between long-term symptoms and PCR test result, as well predictors of persisting symptoms in COVID-positive were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression including potential confounders (age, sex, smoking, comorbidities, time of the phone survey).
          
          
            Results
            
              The study population consisted mostly of young (median of 41 versus 36 years in COVID-positive and COVID-negative, respectively; p=0.020) health care workers (67\% versus 82\%; p=0.006).. Persisting symptoms were reported by 223 (53\%) COVID-positive and 33 (37\%) COVID-negative (
              p
              =0.006). Overall, 21\% COVID-positive and 15\% COVID-negative (p=0.182) consulted a doctor for these symptoms. Four surveyed symptoms were independently associated with COVID-19: fatigue (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14, 95\%CI 1.04-4.41), smell/taste disorder (26.5, 3.46-202), dyspnea (2.81, 1.10-7.16) and memory impairment (5.71, 1.53-21.3). Among COVID-positive, female gender (aOR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.09-2.56) and overweight/obesity (1.67, 1.10-2.56) were predictors of persisting symptoms.
            
          
          
            Limitations
            Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-negative cannot be completely excluded.
          
          
            Conclusion
            More than half of COVID-positive outpatients report persisting symptoms up to 10 months after infection and 21\% seek medical care for this reason. These data suggest that post-COVID syndrome places a significant burden on society and especially healthcare systems.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Countries across the globe have mobilized their armed forces in response to COVID-19, placing them at increased risk for viral exposure. Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 among military personnel serve as biomarkers of infection and provide a basis for disease surveillance and recognition of work-related risk factors.
          
          
            Methods
            Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG in serum obtained from N=995 US National Guard soldiers between April-June 2020. Occupational information, e.g. military operating specialty (MOS) codes, and demographic data were obtained via questionnaire. Plaque assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were used to assess serum neutralizing capacity for limited subjects (N=12).
          
          
            Results
            
              The SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate among the study population was 10.3\% and significantly associated with occupation and demographics. Odds ratios were highest for those working in MOS 2T-Transportation (3.6; 95\% CI 0.7-18) and 92F-Fuel specialist/ground and aircraft (6.8; 95\% CI 1.5-30), as well as black race (2.2; 95\% CI 1.2-4.1), household size ≥6 (2.5; 95\% CI 1.3-4.6) and known COVID-19 exposure (2.0; 95\% CI 1.2-3.3). Seropositivity tracked along major interstate highways and clustered near the international airport and the New York City border. SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG
              +
              serum exhibited low to moderate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity with IC
              50s
              ranging from 1:15 to 1:280. In limited follow-up testing SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG levels remained elevated up to 7 months.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            The data highlight increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among National Guard vs. the local civilian population in association with transportation-related occupations and specific demographics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The threshold of protection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies and their longevity are not known. Interpretation of serological results in with respect to international reference material can inform this essential question.
          
          
            Methods
            1,507 West Midlands dental care professionals were recruited into this study in June 2020. Baseline seroprevalence of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was determined and the cohort was followed longitudinally for 6 months until January/February 2021 through the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and commencement of vaccination.
          
          
            Results
            Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3\% in this cohort, compared to estimates in the general population of between 6-7\%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70\% of participants at 3 and 6-month follow up and conferred a 74\% reduced risk of infection. During follow-up, no PCR-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. Post-vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in individuals with who were seropositive at baseline.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70\% of individuals 6 months after initial sampling and 9 months from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. This response is associated with protection from future infection. Even if serological responses wane, a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is associated with an antibody response indicative of immunological memory.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            Background
            Community-based studies are essential to quantify the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for unbiased characterization of its determinants and outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Gardena valley, a major Alpine touristic destination which was struck in the expansion phase of the COVID-19 pandemic over the winter 2020.
          
          
            Methods
            We surveyed 2244 representative study participants who underwent swab and serum antibody tests. We made multiple comparisons among the Abbott and Diasorin bioassays and serum neutralization titers. Seroprevalence accounted for the stratified design, non-response and test accuracy. Determinants and symptoms predictive of infection were analyzed by weighted multiple logistic regression.
          
          
            Results
            SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 25.2\%, 28.6\%) by June 2020. The serum antibody bioassays had modest agreement with each other. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the serum neutralizing capacity showed better performance of the Abbott test at lower than the canonical threshold. Socio-demographic characteristics showed no clear evidence of association with seropositivity, which was instead associated with place of residence and economic activity. Loss of taste or smell, fever, difficulty in breathing, pain in the limbs, and weakness were the most predictive symptoms of positive antibody test results. Fever and weakness associations were age-dependent.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The Gardena valley had one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in Europe. The age-dependent risk associated with COVID-19 related symptoms implies targeted strategies for screening and prophylaxis planning.},

            Background
            There is growing awareness that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can include long-term neuropsychological deficits, even in its mild or moderate respiratory forms.
          
          
            Methods
            Standardized neuropsychological, psychiatric, neurological and olfactory tests were administered to 45 patients (categorized according to the severity of their respiratory symptoms during the acute phase) 236.51 ± 22.54 days post-discharge following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          
          
            Results
            Deficits were found in all the domains of cognition and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was also high in the three groups. The severe performed more poorly on long-term episodic memory and exhibited greater anosognosia. The moderate had poorer emotion recognition, which was positively correlated with persistent olfactory dysfunction. The mild were more stressed, anxious and depressed.

            Background
            Longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming an important burden to societies and healthcare systems. Data on post-COVID-19 syndrome in the general population are required for the timely planning of healthcare services and resources. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of impaired health status and physical and mental health symptoms among individuals at least six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to characterize their healthcare utilization.
          
          
            Methods
            This population-based prospective cohort study (Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort) enrolled 431 adults from the general population with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to health authorities between 27 February 2020 and 05 August 2020 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We evaluated the proportion of individuals reporting not to have fully recovered since SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the proportion reporting fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnea (mMRC dyspnea scale) or depression (DASS-21) at six to eight months after diagnosis. Furthermore, the proportion of individuals with at least one healthcare contact after their acute illness was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with these main outcomes.
          
          
            Results
            Symptoms were present in 385 (89\%) participants at diagnosis and 81 (19\%) were initially hospitalized. At six to eight months, 111 (26\%) reported not having fully recovered. 233 (55\%) participants reported symptoms of fatigue, 96 (25\%) had at least grade 1 dyspnea, and 111 (26\%) had DASS-21 scores indicating symptoms of depression. 170 (40\%) participants reported at least one general practitioner visit related to COVID-19 after acute illness, and 10\% (8/81) of initially hospitalized individuals were rehospitalized. Individuals that have not fully recovered or suffer from fatigue, dyspnea or depression were more likely to have further healthcare contacts. However, a third of individuals (37/111) that have not fully recovered did not seek further care.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In this population-based study, a relevant proportion of participants suffered from longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection. With millions infected across the world, our findings emphasize the need for the timely planning of resources and patient-centered services for post-COVID-19 care.

              Diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16\%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0\%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95\% CI 1.47–1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test:
              P
               = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95\% CI 2.86–3.40) for patients 20–39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95\% CI 1.06–1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95\% CI 1.58–1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95\% CI 1.12–1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95\% CI 0.98–1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95\% CI 1.73–1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older. Our findings should be verified in other populations.},

            Background
            With the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting whether health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and identifying risk factors is of major concern.
          
          
            Methods
            In this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression.
          
          
            Results
            Among 1,062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28-42] years; 758 [71.4\%] women; 321 [30.2\%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95\%CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); active smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in frontline HCWs was 14.6\% at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in Paris and occurred mainly early. The study argues for an origin of professional in addition to private life contamination and therefore including HCWs in the first-line vaccination target population. It also highlights that smokers were at lower risk.
          
          
            Key messages
            
              
                During the first epidemic wave, 14.6\% of 1,062 first-line Health Care Workers had a positive serology and/or RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.
              
              
                Most infections occurred early
              
              
                Risk was increased by working in infectious diseases (OR 4.22, 95\% confidence interval [0.92; 18.28]), emergency (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and intensive care units (1.80, [0.38; 8.58])
              
              
                Being an active smoker was protective (0.36 [0.21; 0.3]).},

            IMPORTANCE
            As the United States continues to accumulate COVID-19 cases and deaths, and disparities persist, defining the impact of risk factors for poor outcomes across patient groups is imperative.
          
          
            OBJECTIVE
            Our objective is to use real-world healthcare data to quantify the impact of demographic, clinical, and social determinants associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes, to identify high-risk scenarios and dynamics of risk among racial and ethnic groups.
          
          
            DESIGN
            A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between March 1 and August 20, 2020. Fully adjusted logistical regression models for hospitalization, severe disease and mortality outcomes across 1-the entire cohort and 2-within self-reported race/ethnicity groups.
          
          
            SETTING
            Three sites of the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system serving all boroughs of New York City. Data was obtained through automated data abstraction from electronic medical records.
          
          
            PARTICIPANTS
            During the study timeframe, 110,498 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the NewYork-Presbyterian health care system; 11,930 patients were confirmed for COVID-19 by RT-PCR or covid-19 clinical diagnosis.
          
          
            MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
            The predictors of interest were patient race/ethnicity, and covariates included demographics, comorbidities, and census tract neighborhood socio-economic status. The outcomes of interest were COVID-19 hospitalization, severe disease, and death.
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              Of confirmed COVID-19 patients, 4,895 were hospitalized, 1,070 developed severe disease and 1,654 suffered COVID-19 related death. Clinical factors had stronger impacts than social determinants and several showed race-group specificities, which varied among outcomes. The most significant factors in our all-patients models included: age over 80 (OR=5.78, p= 2.29×10
              −24
              ) and hypertension (OR=1.89, p=1.26×10
              −10
              ) having the highest impact on hospitalization, while Type 2 Diabetes was associated with all three outcomes (hospitalization: OR=1.48, p=1.39×10
              −04
              ; severe disease: OR=1.46, p=4.47×10
              −09
              ; mortality: OR=1.27, p=0.001). In race-specific models, COPD increased risk of hospitalization only in Non-Hispanics (NH)-Whites (OR=2.70, p=0.009). Obesity (BMI 30+) showed race-specific risk with severe disease NH-Whites (OR=1.48, p=0.038) and NH-Blacks (OR=1.77, p=0.025). For mortality, Cancer was the only risk factor in Hispanics (OR=1.97, p=0.043), and heart failure was only a risk in NH-Asians (OR=2.62, p=0.001).
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
            Comorbidities were more influential on COVID-19 outcomes than social determinants, suggesting clinical factors are more predictive of adverse trajectory than social factors.
          
          
            KEY POINTS
            
              QUESTION
              What is the impact of patient self-reported race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and clinical profile on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity, and mortality?
            
            
              FINDINGS
              In patients diagnosed with COVID-19, being over 50 years of age, having type 2 diabetes and hypertension were the most important risk factors for hospitalization and severe outcomes regardless of patient race or socioeconomic status.
            
            
              MEANING
              In this large sample pf patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in New York City, we found that clinical comorbidity, more so than social determinants of health, was associated with important patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Between 21 November and 22 December 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 community testing pilot took place in the South Wales Valleys. Lateral flow tests were offered to all people aged over 10 years living, studying or working in the area.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a case-control study in adults taking part in the pilot using an anonymous online questionnaire. Social, demographic and behavioural factors were compared in people with a positive test (cases) and a sample of negatives (controls). Population attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated for factors with significantly increased odds following multivariate analysis.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 199 cases and 2,621 controls were recruited by SMS (response rates: 27.1\% and 37.6\% respectively). Following adjustment, cases were more likely to work in the hospitality sector (aOR: 3.39, 95\% CI: 1.43-8.03), social care (aOR: 2.63, 95\% CI: 1.22-5.67) or healthcare (aOR: 2.31, 95\% CI: 1.29-4.13), live with someone self-isolating due to contact with a case (aOR: 3.07, 95\% CI: 2.03-4.62), visit a pub (aOR: 2.87, 95\% CI: 1.11-7.37), and smoke or vape (aOR: 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.02-2.32). In this community, and at this point in the epidemic, reducing transmission from a household contact who is self-isolating would have the biggest public health impact (PAF: 0.2).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Infection prevention and control should be strengthened to help reduce household transmission. As restrictions on social mixing are relaxed, hospitality venues will become of greater public health importance, and those working in this sector should be adequately protected. Smoking or vaping may be an important modifiable risk factor.
          
          
            What is already known on this subject?
            Certain populations are known to be at risk of severe COVID-19: Older people, males, people in minority ethnic groups, people with pre-existing chronic disease or disability, and people in certain public-facing occupations. However, limited information exists on the factors associated with acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in the community.
          
          
            What this study adds?
            This study provides an insight into the most important factors determining community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We found that transmission within the household was the most important source of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Working in the hospitality sector, and visiting the pub were associated with infection but at the time of this study were relatively infrequent exposures. Smoking or vaping had a small but significant effect. Working in education, living with someone working in education, having caring responsibilities, attending a healthcare appointment and visiting a supermarket, restaurant, gym or leisure centre were not associated with infection. Whilst these findings relate to a specific community at a specific time in the course of the epidemic when social restrictions were in place, the information will be useful in supporting policy decisions. Mass testing exercises present an opportunity to conduct epidemiological studies to gather information to inform the local and national epidemic response.},

            Background
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a true global pandemic infecting more than 30 million people worldwide. Predictive models for key outcomes have the potential to optimize resource utilization and patient outcome as outbreaks continue to occur worldwide. We aimed to design and internally validate a web-based calculator predictive of hospitalization and length of stay (LOS) in a large cohort of COVID-19 positive patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in a New York City health system.
          
          
            Methods
            The study cohort consisted of consecutive adult ({\textgreater}18 years) patients presenting to the ED of one of the Mount Sinai Health System hospitals between March, 2020 and April, 2020 who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Logistic regression was utilized to construct predictive models for hospitalization and prolonged ({\textgreater}3 days) LOS. Discrimination was evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Internal validation with bootstrapping was performed, and a web-based calculator was implemented.
          
          
            Results
            
              The cohort consisted of 5859 patients with a hospitalization rate of 65\% and a prolonged LOS rate of 75\% among hospitalized patients. Independent predictors of hospitalization included older age (OR=6.29; 95\% CI [1.83-2.63], {\textgreater}65 vs. 18-44), male sex (OR=1.35 [1.17-1.55]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=1.74; [1.00-3.03]), hypertension (OR=1.39; [1.13-1.70]), diabetes (OR=1.45; [1.16-1.81]), chronic kidney disease (OR=1.69; [1.23-2.32]), elevated maximum temperature (OR=4.98; [4.28-5.79]), and low minimum oxygen saturation (OR=13.40; [10.59-16.96]). Predictors of extended LOS included older age (OR=1.03 [1.02-1.04], per year), chronic kidney disease (OR=1.91 [1.35-2.71]), elevated maximum temperature (OR=2.91 [2.40- 3.53]), and low minimum percent oxygen saturation (OR=3.89 [3.16-4.79]). AUCs of 0.881 and 0.770 were achieved for hospitalization and LOS, respectively. A calculator was made available under the following URL:

            Conclusion
            The prediction tool derived from this study can be used to optimize resource allocation, guide quality of care, and assist in designing future studies on the triage and management of patients with COVID-19.},

            Background and objective
            Long-term pulmonary sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are not yet confirmed, however preliminary observations suggests a possible relevant clinical, functional and radiological impairment. The aim of this study was to identify and characterise pulmonary sequelae caused by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 6-month follow-up.
          
          
            Methods
            In this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study, patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and without prior diagnosis of structural lung diseases were stratified by maximum ventilatory support (“oxygen only”, “continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)” and “invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)”) and followed up at 6 months from discharge. Pulmonary function tests and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 6 minutes walking test, chest X-ray, physical exam and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score were collected.
          
          
            Results
            Between March and June 2020, 312 patients were enrolled (83, 27\% women; median [IQR] age 61.1 [53.4,69.3] years). The parameters that showed the highest rate of impairment were DLCO and chest-X-ray, in 46\% and 25\% of patients, respectively. However, only a minority of patients reported dyspnoea (31\%), defined as mMRC ≥ 1, or showed a restrictive ventilatory defects (9\%). In the logistic regression model, having asthma as comorbidity was associated with DLCO impairment at follow-up, while prophylactic heparin administration during hospitalisation appeared as a protective factor. Need for invasive ventilatory support during hospitalisation was associated with chest imaging abnormalities.
          
          
            Conclusion
            DLCO and radiological assessment appear to be the most sensitive tools to monitor patients with COVID-19 during follow-up. Future studies with longer follow-up are warranted to better understand pulmonary sequelae.
          
          
            Summary at a glance
            DLCO and radiological assessment are the most sensitive tools to monitor COVID-19 patients at 6-month follow-up. Invasive ventilatory support is a risk factor for detection of radiological abnormalities, but not for DLCO impairment, at follow-up. Whileuse of prophylactic heparin acts as a protective factor on the development of DLCOimpairment.},

            INTRODUCTION
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and 25-OHD levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined.
          
          
            METHODS
            Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation (including outcomes), laboratory measurements (including 25-OHD) and a thoracic computerized tomography (including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D was defined as levels {\textless}20ng/mL ({\textless}50nmol/L) and severely low (or deficient) 25-OHD as a level ≤12ng/mL ({\textless}30nmol/L)
          
          
            RESULTS
            Of the 551 patients included, low 25-OHD levels were present in 45.6\% and severely low levels in 10.9\%. Severely low 25-OHD levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95\%CI 1.24-3.58, p=0.006) but not with critical COVID-19 (OR 0.97, 95\%CI 0.94-0.99, p=0.042), adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by 25-OHD levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat.
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            Vitamin D deficiency (≤12ng/mL or {\textless}30nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low 25-OHD may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.},

            Objectives
            To compare approaches for obtaining relative and absolute estimates of risk of 28-day COVID-19 mortality for adults in the general population of England in the context of changing levels of circulating infection.
          
          
            Design
            Three designs were compared. (A) case-cohort which does not explicitly account for the time-changing prevalence of COVID-19 infection, (B) 28-day landmarking, a series of sequential overlapping sub-studies incorporating time-updating proxy measures of the prevalence of infection, and (C) daily landmarking. Regression models were fitted to predict 28-day COVID-19 mortality.
          
          
            Setting
            Working on behalf of NHS England, we used clinical data from adult patients from all regions of England held in the TPP SystmOne electronic health record system, linked to Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data, using the OpenSAFELY platform.

              March 2020 with recorded sex, postcode and ethnicity. 11,972,947 individuals were included, and 7,999 participants experienced a COVID-19 related death. The study period lasted 100 days, ending 8

              June 2020.
            
          
          
            Predictors
            A range of demographic characteristics and comorbidities were used as potential predictors. Local infection prevalence was estimated with three proxies: modelled based on local prevalence and other key factors; rate of A\&E COVID-19 related attendances; and rate of suspected COVID-19 cases in primary care.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            COVID-19 related death.
          
          
            Results
            All models discriminated well between patients who did and did not experience COVID-19 related death, with C-statistics ranging from 0.92-0.94. Accurate estimates of absolute risk required data on local infection prevalence, with modelled estimates providing the best performance.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Reliable estimates of absolute risk need to incorporate changing local prevalence of infection. Simple models can provide very good discrimination and may simplify implementation of risk prediction tools in practice.},

            Background
            Dysregulated inflammation is associated with poor outcomes in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assessed the efficacy of namilumab, a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitor and infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in order to prioritise agents for phase 3 trials.
          
          
            Methods
            In this randomised, multi-arm, parallel group, open label, adaptive phase 2 proof-of-concept trial (CATALYST) we recruited hospitalised patients ≥ 16 years with COVID-19 pneumonia and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 40mg/L in nine UK hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated with equal probability to usual care, or usual care plus a single 150mg intravenous dose of namilumab (150mg) or infliximab (5mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified for ward versus ICU. The primary endpoint was improvement in inflammation in intervention arms compared to control as measured by CRP over time, analysed using Bayesian multi-level models. ISRCTN registry number 40580903.
          
          
            Findings
            
              Between 15

              June 2020 and 18
              th
              February 2021 we randomised 146 participants: 54 to usual care, 57 to namilumab and 35 to infliximab. The probabilities that namilumab and infliximab were superior to usual care in reducing CRP over time were 97\% and 15\% respectively. Consistent effects were seen in ward and ICU patients and aligned with clinical outcomes, such that the probability of discharge (WHO levels 1-3) at day 28 was 47\% and 64\% for ICU and ward patients on usual care, versus 66\% and 77\% for patients treated with namilumab. 134 adverse events occurred in 30/55 (54.5\%) namilumab patients compared to 145 in 29/54 (53.7\%) usual care patients. 102 events occurred in 20/29 (69.0\%) infliximab patients versus 112 events in 17/34 (50.0\%) usual care patients.
            
          
          
            Interpretation
            Namilumab, but not infliximab, demonstrated proof-of-concept evidence for reduction in inflammation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia which was consistent with secondary clinical outcomes. Namilumab should be prioritised for further investigation in COVID-19.

            Purpose
            The Actionable Register of Geneva Out- and inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 (ARGOS) is an ongoing prospective cohort created by the Geneva Directorate of Health (GDH). It consists of an operational database compiling all SARS-CoV-2 test results conducted in the Geneva area since late February 2020. This article aims at presenting this comprehensive cohort, in light of some of the varying public health measures in Geneva, Switzerland, since March 2020.
          
          
            Participants
            As of June 1st, 2021, the database included 356’868 patients, among which 65’475 had at least one positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. Among all positive patients, 37.6\% were contacted only once, 10.6 \% had one follow-up call, 8.5\% had two, and 27.7\% had 3 or more follow-up calls. Participation rate among positive patients is 94\%. Data collection is ongoing.
          
          
            Findings to date
            ARGOS data illustrates the magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland, and details a variety of population factors and outcomes. The content of the cohort includes demographic data, comorbidities and risk factors for poor clinical outcome, self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, environmental and socio-economic factors, prospective and retrospective contact tracing data, travel quarantine data, and deaths. The registry has already been used in several publications focusing on symptoms and long COVID, infection fatality rate, and re-infection.
          
          
            Future plans
            The data of this large real-world registry provides a valuable resource for various types of research, such as clinical research, epidemiological research or policy assessment as it illustrates the impact of public health policies and overall disease burden of COVID-19.
          
          
            STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
            
              
                ARGOS’ main strength consists of its large number of cases, representative of all diagnosed cases on a regional level with the primary aim of assessing all cases.
              
              
                ARGOS involves every individual who performed a SARS-CoV-2 test (PCR or antigenic) and is not limited to hospitalized patients, thus providing a valuable resource to assess the overall disease burden of COVID-19 in a geographically defined population.
              
              
                To mitigate confounding effects and improve data analysis and interpretation, we present the data according to four policy periods.
              
              
                This cohort is multicentric as it includes all tests performed in Geneva’s hospitals (both public and private), private practices and medical centers.
              
              
                Due to operational needs, symptoms and comorbidities are self-reported, which may lead to measurement error or misclassification.},

            acute sequelae of SAR-CoV-2 (PASC). Most PASC research has focused on hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We used data from a diverse population-based cohort of Arizonans to estimate prevalence of various symptoms of PASC, defined as experiencing at least one symptom 30 days or longer. There were 303 non-hospitalized individuals with a positive lab-confirmed COVID-19 test who were followed for a median of 61 days (range 30-250). COVID-19 positive participants were mostly female (70\%), non-Hispanic white (68\%), and on average 44 years old. Prevalence of PASC at 30 days post-infection was 68.7\% (95\%CI 63.4, 73.9). The most common symptoms were fatigue (37.5\%), shortness-of-breath (37.5\%), brain fog (30.8\%), and stress (30.8\%). The median number of symptoms was 3 (range 1-20). Amongst 157 participants with longer follow-up (≥60 days), PASC prevalence was 77.1\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Global healthcare systems are challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Comprehensively capturing the host physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index and APACHE II score were poor predictors of survival. Plasma proteomics instead identified 14 proteins that showed concentration trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A proteomic predictor trained on single samples obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7) and weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors in an exploratory (AUROC 0.81) as well as in the independent validation cohort (AUROC of 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that predictors derived from plasma protein levels have the potential to substantially outperform current prognostic markers in intensive care.

            Introduction
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) has infected over 22 million individuals worldwide. It remains unclear whether patients with COVID–19 and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) experience worse clinical outcomes compared to similar patients with COVID–19 without RA.
          
          
            Aim
            The aim of this study is to provide insights on how COVID–19 impacted patients with RA given the nature of the disease and medication used.
          
          
            Methods
            RA cases were identified via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and COVID–19 cases by laboratory results in the U.S. based TriNetX network. Patients with COVID–19 and RA were propensity–score matched based on demographics with patients with COVID–19 without RA at a 1:3 ratio. A hospitalized sub-population was defined by procedure codes.
          
          
            Results
            We identified 1,014 COVID-19 patients with RA and 3,042 non-RA matches selected from 137,757 patients. The odds of hospitalization (non-RA:23\%, RA:24.6\%, OR:1.08, 95\% CI: 0.88 to 1.33) or mortality (non-RA:5.4\%, RA:6\%, OR:0.93, 95\% CI: 0.65 to 1.34) were not significantly different.
            The hospitalized sub-population included 249 patients with COVID-19 and RA and 745 non-RA matches selected from 21,435 patients. The risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (non-RA:18.8\%, RA:18.1\%, OR:0.94, 95\% CI: 0.60 to 1.45), and inpatient mortality (non-RA:14.4\%, RA:14.5\%, OR:0.86, 95\% CI: 0.53 to 1.40) were not significantly different.
          
          
            Conclusion
            We didn’t find evidence suggesting patients with COVID–19 and RA are more likely to have severe outcomes than patients with COVID–19 without RA.
          
          
            Key Messages
            
              
                – Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) tend to be older, and often have co-morbidities which could put them at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
              
              
                – This study is one of the largest studies of COVID-19 infected RA populations to date. We did not find increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, or mortality among RA patients vs. matched non-RA patients.
              
              
                – Patients previously exposed to anti-coagulants experienced higher risks of hospitalization and overall mortality. Extra attention is needed for treating such patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that results in a prothrombotic state manifesting as thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population.
          
          
            Methods
            A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to a single university hospital for COVID-19 infection was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcomes were each of the components of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation.
          
          
            Results
            242 patients were included in the study and divided into 4 subgroups: therapeutic anticoagulation (TAC), prophylactic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (PACAP), therapeutic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (TACAP), and prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) which was the reference for comparison. Multivariable cox regression analysis and propensity matching were done and showed when compared to PAC, TACAP and TAC were associated with less in-hospital all cause mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.113 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.028-0.449) and 0.126 (95\% CI, 0.028-0.528) respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) in both subgroups was 11. Furthermore, PACAP was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation with an aHR of 0.07 (95\% CI, 0.014-0.351). However, the was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of major or minor bleeds, ICU admission, or the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents or therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with a better outcome in comparison to prophylactic anticoagulation alone without an increase in the risk of major and minor bleeds. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulants agents or using therapeutic anticoagulation in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
          
          
            What is already known about this subject ?
            Covid-19 infection is associated with several complex coagulation disorders resulting in thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. Currently, prophylactic dose anticoagulation is considered the standard of care antithrombotic regimen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, high-quality data about the subject is unavailable.
          
          
            What does this study add?
            This is the first adequately sized study in the literature to dwell on the antithrombotic strategy consisting of combination anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 induced hypercoagulable state. Furthermore, it also challenges the currently recommended prophylactic dosing of anticoagulation used in the treatment of those patients.
          
          
            How might this impact on clinical practice?
            Our data suggests for the first time that concurrent use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is associated with a superior clinical outcome as compared to prophylactic anticoagulation used alone. Furthermore, it solidifies the emerging evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation is linked to better clinical results than prophylactic anticoagulation.},

            Objective
            To describe persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 in different spectrum of disease severity in a population from an upper/middle income country, and identify the main clinical features impacting the quality of life.
          
          
            Design
            Cross-sectional study.
          
          
            Setting
            Outpatient clinic from a public post-COVID-19 health center (CPC) at Bahia-Brazil, a state where 80\% are black or mixed race.
          
          
            Participants
            Patients admitted between August 2020 and February 2021 with symptoms at least one month after the onset of COVID-19.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            PACS and related disorders such as hospitalization one month or later after disease onset, biochemical dysregulation and reduced quality of life (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire).
          
          
            Results
            Among 683 individuals assisted at CPC in this period, 602 were recruited. Patients had average of 52 (±14.6) years, 355 (59\%) were female, 528 (88\%) black/brown. Individuals were classified as mild (39.9\%), moderate (27.9\%) or severe (32.2\%) during acute illness if outpatient, hospitalized non-UCI or UCI, respectively. Most patients reported a polysymptomatic profile, in median eight (IQR=6-9) acute symptoms. The most frequent residual symptoms were dyspnea (66\%), fatigue (62\%) and chest pain (43\%). Women were more affected regardless disease severity at acute stage: presented more residual symptoms [4 (2-6) vs 3 (2-4)] and a higher impact in quality of life. Altered HbA1c [(184/275 (66.9\%)], high CRP levels [195/484 (40.3\%)] and anemia [143/545 (26.2\%)] were the most common abnormalities in laboratory exams. 76 patients presented HbA1c above 6.4\% although only 42 referred previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. After one month of disease onset, 30 patients required hospitalization, including seven cases with mild acute illness. Hospital admission after acute disease was required on 30 patients, seven (23\%) were mild. Quality of life had been affected for 357/404 (88.4\%) patients according to EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L), mainly the domains of anxiety/depression [severe or extreme anxiety for 79/401 (19.7\%)] and pain/discomfort [severe or extreme pain for 71/403 (17.6\%)]. The median EuroQoL Global Score was 70 [IQR 50-80]. PACS symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue, was associated with decreased quality of life.
          
          
            Conclusions
            PACS, such as dyspnea, chest pain and fatigue, occurred after variable degree of disease severity. Among this majority black/mixed-race patients, woman seemed to be more affected. Other consequences included post-acute hospitalization, and abnormal glucose metabolism and reduced quality of life.
          
          
            Summary Box
            
              Section 1: What is already known on this topic:
            
            
              
                ✓ Post-Acute COVID Syndrome (PACS) comprises a set of persistent or new-onset symptoms after illness onset.
              
              
                ✓ As far as we know, there are no studies describing PACS in a population principally black and mixed-race. Additionally, few studies have addressed PACS among outpatients.
              
            
            
              Section 2: What this study adds:
            
            
              
                ✓ Similar PACS were reported after mild, moderate and severe illness. Dyspnea, fatigue and chest pain were the most prevalent symptoms in this population presenting majority of black/mixed-race patients.
              
              
                ✓ Women presented more residual symptoms, a higher frequency of myalgia and worse score for mobility, usual activities, anxiety/depression, and pain.
              
              
                ✓ Hospitalization may occur one month or later after mild or moderate/severe acute infection due to respiratory and vascular disorders. Abnormal glucose metabolism was detected in the absence of previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.},

            Objectives
            The interest in interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (IL-6RA) and steroids have increased recently due to their potential role as immunomodulatory effect in critically ill coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The magnitude of this therapy in subgroups of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) remains to be fully clarified. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients requiring iMV, and receiving IL-6RA and steroids with different steroids regimens.
          
          
            Design
            International, multicenter, observational study derived from Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study registry and conducted through Discovery Network, Society of Critical Care Medicine. Marginal structural modeling was used to adjust time-dependent confounders; observations were weighted using inverse probability of treatment weight. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for target trial design.
          
          
            Setting
            168 hospitals, 16 countries.
          
          
            Patients
            Covid-19 ICU patients (≥18 years) requiring MV between March 01,2020, and January 10,2021.
          
          
            Intervention
            None.
          
          
            Measurements and Main Results
            Of 860 patients met eligibility criteria, 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6RA, and 101 combinations; groups were balanced after adjustment. Median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (IQR:6-14 mg); 80.8\% and 19.2\% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively. The median C-reactive protein level was {\textgreater}75 mg/L in majority of our cohort. The use of IL-6R antagonists alone or in combination was not associated with a significant difference in ventilator-free days (VFD) compared to steroids alone with different steroids regimens (adjusted incidence rate ratio [95\% CI]): IL-6R antagonists (1.12 [0.88,1.4]), combination (0.83 [0.6,1.14]). Patients treated with low or high-dose steroids had non-significant differences in VFD compared to IL-6RA (ß=0.62, 95\% CI −1.54,2.78 for low-dose steroid; ß=-1.19, 95\% CI −3.85,1.47 for high-dose steroid). There was no difference in 28-day mortality and hospital mortality with IL-6RA alone or in combination compared to steroids alone (28-day mortality adjusted odds ratio [95\% CI]): IL-6RA (0.68[0.44,1.07]), combination (1.07[0.67,1.70]). Sensitivity analysis findings were consistent with primary analysis. Liver dysfunction was higher in IL-6RA (p=0.04) while rate of bacteremia did not differ among groups.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In adult ICU COVID-19 patients on iMV, we found no difference in outcomes between those who received IL-6RA, steroids, or combination therapy and those who received IL-6RA or low-or high-dose steroids. Further randomized trials are needed to enhance our understanding for IL-6RA safety with different steroids regimen and the magnitude of benefit in those subgroups of patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Importance
            
              The
              ACE
              D allele is more prevalent among African Americans (AA) compared to other races/ethnicities and has previously been associated with severe COVID-19 pathogenesis through excessive ACE1 activity. ACE-I/ARBs may counteract this mechanism, but their association with COVID-19 outcomes has not been specifically tested in the AA population.
            
          
          
            Objectives
            To determine whether the use of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in AA compared with non-AA population.
          
          
            Design, Setting, and Participants
            In this observational, retrospective study, patient-level data were extracted from the Mount Sinai Health System’s (MSHS) electronic medical record (EMR) database, and 6,218 patients with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from February 24 to May 31, 2020 were identified as ACE-I/ARB users.
          
          
            Exposures
            Patients with an active prescription from January 1, 2019 up to the date of admission for ACE-I/ARB (outpatient use) and patients administered ACE-I/ARB during hospitalization (in-hospital use) were identified.
          
          
            Main Outcomes and Measures
            The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, assessed in the entire, AA, and non-AA population.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 6,218 COVID-19 patients, 1,138 (18.3\%) were ACE-I/ARB users. In a multivariate logistic regression model, ACE-I/ARB use was independently associated with reduced risk of in-hospital mortality in the entire population (OR, 0.655; 95\% CI, 0.505-0.850; P=0.001), AA population (OR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.249-0.779; P=0.005), and non-AA population (OR, 0.748, 95\% CI, 0.553-1.012, P=0.06). In the AA population, in-hospital use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with improved mortality (OR, 0.378; 95\% CI, 0.188-0.766; P=0.006) while outpatient use was not (OR, 0.889; 95\% CI, 0.375-2.158; P=0.812). When analyzing each medication class separately, ARB in-hospital use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in the AA population (OR, 0.196; 95\% CI, 0.074-0.516; P=0.001), while ACE-I use was not associated with impact on mortality in any population.
          
          
            Conclusion and Relevance
            In-hospital use of ARBs was associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality among COVID-19-positive AA patients. These results support further investigation of ARBs to improve outcomes in AA patients at high risk for COVID-19-related mortality.},

            Background
            People experiencing homelessness (PEH) and associated shelter workers may be at higher risk of infection with “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among PEH and shelter workers in Denmark.
          
          
            Design and methods
            In November 2020, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional seroprevalence study among PEH and shelter workers at 21 recruitment sites in Denmark. The assessment included a point-of-care test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, followed by a questionnaire. The seroprevalence was compared to that of geographically matched blood donors considered as a proxy for the background population, tested using a total Ig ELISA assay.
          
          
            Results
            We included 827 participants in the study, of whom 819 provided their SARS-CoV-2 antibody results. Of those, 628 were PEH (median age 50.8 (IQR 40.9-59.1) years, 35.5\% female) and 191 were shelter workers (median age 46.6 (IQR 36.1-55.0) years and 74.5\% female). The overall seroprevalence was 6.7\% and was similar among PEH and shelter workers (6.8\% vs 6.3\%, p=0.87); and 12.2\% among all participants who engaged in sex work. The overall participant seroprevalence was significantly higher than that of the background population (2.9\%, p {\textless}0.001). When combining all participants who reported sex work or were recruited at designated safe havens, we found a significantly increased risk of seropositivity compared to other participants (RR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.16-3.75, p=0.02). Seropositive and seronegative participants reported a similar presence of at least one SARS-CoV-2 associated symptom (49\% and 54\%, respectively).
          
          
            Interpretations
            The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was more than twice as high among PEH and associated shelter workers, compared to the background population. The subset of the study participants who were also sex workers were at particularly high risk of COVID-19 infection.

            Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has infected over 114 million people worldwide as of March 2021, with worldwide mortality rates ranging between 1-10\%. We use information on up to 421,111 UK Biobank participants to identify possible predictors for long-term susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection (
            N
            =1,088) and mortality (
            N
            =376). We include 36,168 predictors in our analyses and use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm and feature attribution based on Shapley values, together with traditional epidemiological approaches to identify possible risk factors. Our analyses show associations between socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity, education, material deprivation, accommodation type) and lifestyle indicators (e.g. smoking, physical activity, walking pace, tea intake, and dietary changes) with risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Blood (cystatin C, C-reactive protein, gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase) and urine (microalbuminuria) biomarkers measured more than 10 years earlier predicted severe COVID-19. We also confirm increased risks for several pre-existing disease outcomes (e.g. lung diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, circulatory diseases, anemia, and mental disorders). Analyses on mortality were possible within a sub-group testing positive for COVID-19 infection (
            N
            =1,953) with our analyses confirming association between age, smoking status, and prior primary diagnosis of urinary tract infection.
          
          
            SUMMARY
            Our hypothesis-free approach combining machine learning with traditional epidemiological methods finds a number of risk factors (sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors, biomarkers, disease outcomes and treatments) associated with developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and COVID-19 mortality.},

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
          
            Background
            Rates of severe illness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 are greater for males, but the mechanisms for this difference are unclear. Understanding the differences in outcomes between males and females across the age spectrum will guide both public health and biomedical interventions.
          
          
            Methods
            Retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing and admission data in a health system. Patient-level data were assessed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling was used to identify features associated with increased male risk of severe outcomes.
          
          
            Results
            In 213,175 SARS-CoV-2 tests, despite similar positivity rates (8.2\%F vs 8.9\%M), males were more frequently hospitalized (28\%F vs 33\%M). Of 2,626 hospitalized individuals, females had less severe presenting respiratory parameters and males had more fever. Comorbidity burden was similar, but with differences in specific conditions. Medications relevant for SARS-CoV-2 were used at similar frequency except tocilizumab (M{\textgreater}F). Males had higher inflammatory lab values. In a logistic regression model, male sex was associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes at 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95\%CI 1.75, 5.18) and at peak status (OR 2.58, 95\%CI 1.78,3.74) among 18-49 year-olds. Block-wise addition of potential explanatory variables demonstrated that only the inflammatory labs substantially modified the OR associated with male sex across all ages.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Higher levels of clinical inflammatory labs are the only features that are associated with the heightened risk of severe outcomes and death for males in COVID-19.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            COVID-19 is associated with long-term pulmonary symptoms and may result in chronic pulmonary impairment. The optimal procedures to prevent, identify, monitor, and treat these pulmonary sequelae are elusive.
          
          
            Research question
            To characterize the kinetics of pulmonary recovery, risk factors and constellations of clinical features linked to persisting radiological lung findings after COVID-19.
          
          
            Study design and methods
            A longitudinal, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study including COVID-19 patients (n = 108). Longitudinal pulmonary imaging and functional readouts, symptom prevalence, clinical and laboratory parameters were collected during acute COVID-19 and at 60-, 100- and 180-days follow-up visits. Recovery kinetics and risk factors were investigated by logistic regression. Classification of clinical features and study participants was accomplished by k-means clustering, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and naive Bayes algorithms.
          
          
            Results
            At the six-month follow-up, 51.9\% of participants reported persistent symptoms with physical performance impairment (27.8\%) and dyspnea (24.1\%) being the most frequent. Structural lung abnormalities were still present in 45.4\% of the collective, ranging from 12\% in the outpatients to 78\% in the subjects treated at the ICU during acute infection. The strongest risk factors of persisting lung findings were elevated interleukin-6 (IL6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) during recovery and hospitalization during acute COVID-19. Clustering analysis revealed association of the lung lesions with increased anti-S1/S2 antibody, IL6, CRP, and D-dimer levels at the early follow-up suggesting non-resolving inflammation as a mechanism of the perturbed recovery.
            Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of risk class assignment and prediction of individual risk of delayed lung recovery employing clustering and machine learning algorithms.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Severity of acute infection, and systemic inflammation is strongly linked to persistent post-COVID-19 lung abnormality. Automated screening of multi-parameter health record data may assist the identification of patients at risk of delayed pulmonary recovery and optimize COVID-19 follow-up management.

          Prior preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide system may provide a useful framework for better understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and the repurposing of psychotropic medications with functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, called FIASMA psychotropic medications, against COVID-19. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medication use among patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observational multicenter retrospective study conducted at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adult patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 164 (30.1\%) received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at study baseline, which was defined as the date of hospital admission for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and psychotropic and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). There was a significant association between FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline and reduced risk of intubation or death both in the crude analysis (HR=0.42; 95\%CI=0.31-0.57; p{\textless}0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=0.50; 95\%CI=0.37-0.67; p{\textless}0.01). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggested that this association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. These results suggest the usefulness of the ASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Older chronological age is the most powerful risk factor for adverse coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcomes. It is uncertain, however, whether older biological age, as assessed by leucocyte telomere length (LTL), is also associated with COVID-19 outcomes.
          
          
            Methods
            We associated LTL values obtained from participants recruited into UK Biobank (UKB) during 2006-2010 with adverse COVID-19 outcomes recorded by 30 November 2020, defined as a composite of any of the following: hospital admission, need for critical care, respiratory support, or mortality. Using information on 131 LTL-associated genetic variants, we conducted exploratory Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses in UKB to evaluate whether observational associations might reflect cause-and-effect relationships.
          
          
            Findings
            Of 6,775 participants in UKB who had tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the community, there were 914 (13.5\%) with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was 1·17 (95\% CI 1·05-1·31; P=0·004) per 1-SD shorter usual LTL, after adjustment for chronological age, sex and ethnicity. Similar ORs were observed in analyses that: adjusted for additional risk factors; disaggregated the composite outcome and reduced the scope for selection or collider bias. In MR analyses, the OR for adverse COVID-19 outcomes was directionally concordant but non-significant.
          
          
            Interpretation
            Shorter LTL, indicative of older biological age, is associated with higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, independent of several major risk factors for COVID-19 including chronological age. Further data are needed to determine whether this association reflects causality.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are at greater risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently unknown. Prospective serologic studies may allow seroincidence analyses, where all infections are accurately identified. Because of this, we evaluated the incidence of and associated factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH in Southern Spain.
          
          
            Methods

            Results
            
              710 PLWH were included in the study. Of them, 46 [6.5\%, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 4.8\%-8.5\%] patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between May 18

After multivariate analysis, adjusted by age and sex, active tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with lower risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (Incidence rate ratio 0.35, 95\% CI: 0.18-0.68, p=0.002).
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH in Southern Spain during the ongoing pandemic was lower than that reported for the general population in the same area. Tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with a lower risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          
          
            Summary
            The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people living with HIV is lower than that of general population in Southern Spain. Active tobacco smoking could be associated with a lower risk of developing COVID-19.},

            Background
            As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, and hospitals are treating a large number of patients with COVID-19, easy-to-use risk models that predict hospital mortality can assist in clinical decision making and triage.
          
          
            Objective
            As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, easy-to-use risk models that predict hospital mortality can assist in clinical decision making and triage. We aimed to develop a risk score model for in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that was robust across hospitals and used clinical factors that are readily available and measured standardly across hospitals.
          
          
            Methods
            In this observational study we developed a risk score model using data collected by trained abstractors for patients in 20 diverse hospitals across the state of Michigan (Mi-COVID19) who were discharged between March 5, 2020 and August 14, 2020. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization or were discharged with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) were included. We employed an iterative forward selection approach to consider the inclusion of 145 potential risk factors available at hospital presentation. Model performance was externally validated with patients from 19 hospitals in the Mi-COVID19 registry not used in model development. We shared the model in an easy-to-use online application that allows the user to predict in-hospital mortality risk for a patient if they have any subset of the variables in the final model.
          
          
            Results
            Our final model includes the patient’s age, first recorded respiratory rate, first recorded pulse oximetry, highest creatinine level on day of presentation, and hospital’s COVID-19 mortality rate. No other factors showed sufficient incremental model improvement to warrant inclusion. The AUC for the derivation and validation sets were .796 and .829 respectively.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients can be reliably estimated using a few factors, which are standardly measured and available to physicians very early in a hospital encounter.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an essential indicator to guide measures. Few population-based estimates are available in Germany. We determine seroprevalence allowing comparison between regions, time points, socio-demographic and health-related factors.
          MuSPAD is a sequential multi-local seroprevalence study. We randomly recruited adults in five counties with differing cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence July 2020 - February 2021. Serostatus was determined using Spike S1-specific IgG ELISA. We determined county-wise proportions of seropositivity. We assessed underestimation of infections, county and age specific infection fatality risks, and association of seropositivity with demographic, socioeconomic and health factors.
          We found seroprevalence of 2.4 \% (95\%CI: 1.8-3.1\%) for Reutlingen in June 2020 (stage 1) which increased to 2.9\% (95\%CI: 2.1-3.8\%) in October (stage 2), Freiburg stage 1 1.5\% (95\% CI: 1.1-2.1\%) vs. 2.5\% (95\%CI: 1.8-3.4\%), Aachen stage 1 2.3\% (95\% CI: 1.7-3.1\%) vs. 5.4\% (95\%CI: 4.4-6.6\%), Osnabrück 1.3\% (95\% CI: 1.0-1.9\%) and Magdeburg in Nov/Dec 2020. 2.4\% (95\%CI 1.9-3.1\%). Number needed to quarantine to have one infected person quarantined was 8.2. The surveillance detection ratio (SDR) between number of infections based on our results and number reported to health authorities ranged from 2.5-4.5. Participants aged 80+ had lower SDR. Infection fatality estimates ranged from 0.2-2.4\%. Lower education was associated with higher, smoking with lower seropositivity.
          Seroprevalence remained low until December 2020 with high underdetection. The second wave from November 2020 to February 2021 resulted in additional 2-5\% of the population being infected. Detected age specific differences of SDR should be taken into account in modelling and forecasting COVID-19 morbidity.

              Seroepidemiological surveys on SARS-CoV-2 are a useful tool to track the transmission during the epidemic. We searched PubMed/the pre-print server medRxiv and included web-based reports from German health organizations using the keywords “seroprevalence”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Germany” and similar other English and German terms in the period from January 1st, 2020 until March 2021. We identified 30 published studies in Germany which mostly report low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence ({\textless}5\%). Most of these surveys were so-called hotspot studies which assessed seroprevalence after localized outbreaks or examined seroprevalence of specific population groups such as e.g. medical staff. Few studies are either population-based or blood donor-based, but do not allow comparisons between regions. To date, we only consider the Corona sub-study of the Rhineland study similar to MuSPAD. It reports a low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (46/4755; 0.97\%; 95\% CI: 0.72−1.30). Based on this, almost the entire German population remained susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the end of 2020.
            
            
              Added value of this study
              We provide the first comprehensive, high-precision multi-region population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study with representative sampling following the WHO protocol in Germany. By measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we explore immunity at regional and national level over time. We also assess risk factors and sample each region twice, which permits to monitor seroprevalence progression throughout the epidemic in different exemplary German regions.
            
            
              Implications of all the available evidence
              Our results show low seroprevalence ({\textless}3\%) until Mid-December 2020 in all regions. While estimates in Reutlingen, Aachen, Freiburg and Osnabrück reflect low seroprevalence mostly after the first wave, the survey in Magdeburg cumulatively already represents the beginning of the second wave. The number needed to quarantine to ensure one infected person was quarantined was 8.2 in our study. We also show that for the first wave reported infections reflected overall around 25\% of those actually infected rising to 40-50\% in the second wave. A slightly raised infection risk could be shown for persons with lower education.},

            Background
            Patients with COVID-19 may be at high risk for thrombotic complications due to excess inflammatory response and stasis of blood flow. This study aims to assess the incidence of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, risk factors and the impact on survival.
          
          
            Method
            A retrospective case-control study was conducted at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in, Saudi Arabia between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by Computed Tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) formed the case group. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and without confirmed diagnose of pulmonary embolism formed the control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of pulmonary embolism and its survival.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 159 patients participated were included in the study, of which 51 were the cases (patients with pulmonary embolism) and 108 patients formed the control group (patients without pulmonary embolism). The incidence of PE among hospitalized was around 32\%. Smoking history, low level of oxygen saturation and higher D-dimer values were important risk factors that were associated with a higher risk of developing PE (p{\textless} 0.05). Higher respiratory rate was associated with higher odds of death, and decrease the possibility of survival among hospitalised patients with PE.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Pulmonary embolism is common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Preventive measures should be considered for hospitalized patients with smoking history, low level of oxygen saturation, high D-dimer values, and high respiratory rate.},

METHODS: The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive.
RESULTS: HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5\%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24\%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p {\textless} 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9\% vs. 20.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with shortterm mortality in the Cox multivariate analysis (1.62; 95\% CI 1.29-2.03; p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, systemic infammatory response syndrome and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p {\textless} 0.001), and mortality (39.7\% vs. 15.5\%; p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19. Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during in-hospital stay.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an essential indicator to guide measures. Few population-based estimates are available in Germany. We determine seroprevalence allowing comparison between regions, time points, socio-demographic and health-related factors.
          MuSPAD is a sequential multi-local seroprevalence study. We randomly recruited adults in five counties with differing cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence July 2020 - February 2021. Serostatus was determined using Spike S1-specific IgG ELISA. We determined county-wise proportions of seropositivity. We assessed underestimation of infections, county and age specific infection fatality risks, and association of seropositivity with demographic, socioeconomic and health factors.
          We found seroprevalence of 2.4 \% (95\%CI: 1.8-3.1\%) for Reutlingen in June 2020 (stage 1) which increased to 2.9\% (95\%CI: 2.1-3.8\%) in October (stage 2), Freiburg stage 1 1.5\% (95\% CI: 1.1-2.1\%) vs. 2.5\% (95\%CI: 1.8-3.4\%), Aachen stage 1 2.3\% (95\% CI: 1.7-3.1\%) vs. 5.4\% (95\%CI: 4.4-6.6\%), Osnabrück 1.3\% (95\% CI: 1.0-1.9\%) and Magdeburg in Nov/Dec 2020. 2.4\% (95\%CI 1.9-3.1\%). Number needed to quarantine to have one infected person quarantined was 8.2. The surveillance detection ratio (SDR) between number of infections based on our results and number reported to health authorities ranged from 2.5-4.5. Participants aged 80+ had lower SDR. Infection fatality estimates ranged from 0.2-2.4\%. Lower education was associated with higher, smoking with lower seropositivity.
          Seroprevalence remained low until December 2020 with high underdetection. The second wave from November 2020 to February 2021 resulted in additional 2-5\% of the population being infected. Detected age specific differences of SDR should be taken into account in modelling and forecasting COVID-19 morbidity.

	abstract = {Abstract
          ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report, our 15th report, is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis for data captured before 26 May 2021. The report marks a significant milestone – the submission of clinical data from over half a million individuals hospitalised with COVID-19. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support.
          Data have been entered for 516,689 individuals from 788 partner institutions and networks, covering 1651 sites across 63 countries. This is an increase of 176,377 case entries and data from an additional 9 countries since our most recent report dated 08 April 2021.
          
            The comprehensive analyses detailed in this report includes hospitalised individuals of all ages:
            
              
                for whom data collection occurred between 30 January 2020 and up to and including 25 May 2021; AND
              
              
                who have laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection or clinically diagnosed COVID-19.
              
            
          
          For the 442,643 cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report, selected findings include:
          
            
              
                median age of 60 years, with an approximately equal (50/50) male:female sex distribution
              
              
                one third of the cohort are at least 70 years of age, whereas 3\% are 0-19 years of age
              
              
                the most common symptom combination in this hospitalised cohort is shortness of breath, cough, and history of fever, which has remained constant over time
              
              
                the five most common symptoms at admission were shortness of breath, cough, history of fever, fatigue/malaise, and altered consciousness/confusion, which is unchanged from the previous reports
              
              
                age-associated differences in symptoms are evident, including the frequency of altered consciousness increasing with age, and fever, respiratory and constitutional symptoms being present mostly in those 40 years and above
              
              
                16\% of patients with relevant data available were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit (ICU), which is slightly lower than previously reported (19\%)
              
              
                antibiotic use remains very high (61\%), although it is lower than previously reported (80\%), in those for whom relevant data are available (288,125); in ICU/HDU patients with data available (36,073), 92\% received antibiotics
              
              
                use of corticosteroids was reported for 25\% of patients of all types for whom data were available (288,125); in ICU/HDU patients with data available (36,021), 62\% received corticosteroids
              
              
                outcomes are known for 411,368 patients and the overall estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) is 25\% (95\%CI 24.8-25), rising to 38\% (95\%CI 37.5-38.3) for patients who were admitted to ICU/HDU, demonstrating worse outcomes in those with the most severe disease

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the long-term (?4 weeks) use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is a risk factor for intubation requirement and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, a total of 382 adult patients (?18 years of age) with confirmed COVID?19 who were hospitalized for treatment were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to the periods during which they used PPIs: the first group included patients who were not on PPI treatment, and the second group included those who have used PPIs for more than 4 weeks.
RESULTS: The study participants were grouped according to their PPI usage history over the last 6 months. In total, 291 patients did not use any type of PPI over the last 6 months, and 91 patients used PPIs for more than 4 weeks. Older age (HR: 1.047, 95\% CI: 1.026?1.068), current smoking (HR: 2.590, 95\% CI: 1.334?5.025), and PPI therapy for more than 4 weeks (HR: 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.06?2.41) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality.
DISCUSSION: The results obtained in this study show that using PPIs for more than 4 weeks is associated with negative outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Patients receiving PPI therapy should be evaluated more carefully if they are hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment.},

            Background:
            While
            
            pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) appears to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), data on patients with CVD and concomitant cancer is limited. Evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19.
            Methods:
            Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested.
            Results:
            Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8\%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3\%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-6.24; p{\textless}0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR=1.33, 95\%CI: 1.01 - 1.76; p=0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR=1.72, 95\%CI: 1.05-2.80; p=0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR=1.18, 95\% CI: 0.99 - 1.41; p=0.07).
            Conclusion:
            Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.},

	abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the main causes of high mortality among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This study aimed at determining the association between presence of chronic diseases and smoking behaviors with the development of ARDS among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-‘Aisyiyah–affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.},

            Background
            SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a global pandemic, but an antiviral therapy for this novel strain of coronavirus does not currently exist. The objective of our study was to investigate the antiviral potential of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACHR) agonist varenicline tartrate against SARS-CoV-2.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We assessed antiviral activity using
              in vitro
              human cell assays and we assessed
              in vivo
              efficacy in a rhesus macaque model.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              In vitro
              studies found that varenicline tartrate, over a range of concentrations, reduced the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, alpha, and beta variants in Calu-3 cells and Caco-2 cells, with maintenance of cell viability.
              In vivo
              studies found that varenicline tartrate, administered as a nasal spray to rhesus macaques, reduced SARS-CoV-2 wildtype viral load and inhibited viral replication in the nasal mucosa and upper airway.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            Although the study reported here was exploratory, we have confirmed that the nAChR agonist varenicline has the potential to interact with and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.},
